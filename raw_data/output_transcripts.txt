(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome to a brand new video I found 15 Subaru gc8s for sale in South Africa so over the past six months I've been kind of collecting well stalking maybe would be the better word or the Subaru gc8s that have been for sale on a few gf8s as well that have been for sale in South Africa this has been going on since about December plus minus of 2022 we're now sitting in May 2023 so roughly about six months now unlike the old series that I used to do JDM Cars for sale in South Africa I'm not going to give these cars ratings so I've got quite a strong love for these uh gc8s if you haven't been able to tell this is not a green screen I am sitting in the garage um muscle the gc8 GT Turbo my blue gc8 this is uh it's a normally aspirated one but pulling the motor and doing a whole bunch of work if you haven't been following the series you guys should be following the series because there's a lot happening a couple spoilers or I mean I'm sure

(Start: 00:01:01)
you've been seeing on Instagram if you haven't you can see that there's seats installed I've got a big ring on it already cars looking good there's a lot of stuff happening to the car but that's not what this video is about this video is about the 15 plus gc8 that I found for sale online now if you guys remember I used to do JDM Cars for sale in South Africa to the east this format is not anything like that I'm not going to be giving these cars ratings I'm just going to be showing you guys what I found what I think about them and I love every single one of these cars even the worst you guys can figure out which is the worst so diving straight into we we're going to be going based on color so we're going to start with the color black and first of all we've got this uh preface lift gc8 now a lot of people don't list their the year models and all that stuff for the car so I'm kind of guessing what it is I've taken screenshots of the sale on Facebook Marketplace Etc whatever I found the vehicle and then a couple of the other pictures that were came along with it there's a bunch of hottie dolls somewhere outside and it's like seven

(Start: 00:02:02)
o'clock at night crazy um so this guy he wants 120k for the car this car is currently for sale on the date 28th of May 2023 it's still for sale right now uh he wants 120 code for it he says he's won a few car shows there's no smoke there's no problems 147 kilometers on it it's got a sunroof it says limited because of the sunroof that doesn't make the car limited it does have the JDM tail lights like I've got on both of these cars um but those can be bought anywhere I don't know what it does but if we look at the other pictures it is definitely pre-facelift so it doesn't have the crystal uh Crystal lights Crystal fogs it's got the two lines on the bumper these new Edge ones have got the single line looks a lot neater um a lot more modern and I think a lot more aggressive however I do love the style especially when you put those like square-ish fog lamp covers the ones that the STI has had I think it looked awesome

(Start: 00:03:03)
unfortunately he doesn't have any pictures of the interior so I can't make out if it's got the modern Dash which I doubt it's probably got the the pre-judging by the door cards so that's the one that I found that's still available right now uh this one unfortunately the guy he had one picture I don't know if it's the same car actually is that the same cover the same Wheels I probably should have looked before I know ways huh no ways it's the same car it's got a sunroof I didn't put two and two together okay so this dude I'll tell you the date now uh I don't know why the shoes today hmm the date's all screwed I don't know let's say like four months ago plus

(Start: 00:04:04)
minus if this is all for my Google Drive if I log into Google Drive it'll tell me when I upload it but estimate four months ago this car is listed for seventy thousand Rand no details analysis for 120 000 and I'm pretty sure the dude's done nothing oh please excuse me I need a haircut urgently kids have been sick I've been sick haven't had a chance to get anything done um how crazy is that so it's actually the same car I'll skip that one because there's only one picture meanwhile it's the same haircut Matt so he wants 120k uh that's all the black ones that I found then there's two blue ones this one I saw this two three weeks after I bought this thing and I was like damn you know I wish I I wish I got this um if this car is is near Factory it's it's almost standard like a buddy of mine we go way back we I'm talking Subaru Club 2006 ish

(Start: 00:05:06)
um he has a red blob eye and he'll end up buying this car and he's fulfilling a childhood dream of of owning one of these old pieces of car and he picked this thing up and then out of the car sitting in Durban so we just missed each other I think he picked it up in January and I left in December so this car like I said Neo Factory has got 16 inch wheels um that's the new age bumper that I was talking about Crystal Fox Crystal headlights it's got that standard wing on it the GT Wing it's got the yellow and red so not the JDM tail lights power exhaust it's riding on stock suspension and then engine bay stock there's this little heat shield shroud thing it's not stock but I mean it's not doing anything it's not saving any purpose aluminum radiator it's actually exactly

(Start: 00:06:07)
the same rate I had to have in the silver car which is a Silverton radiator special it's an aluminum in tank top tank actually the whole thing is aluminum not just tanks beautiful beautiful car if you look at that you can see it's look at the stock dump valve set up on it absolutions for grabbing this thing he's I know he's happy I know he's happy with this thing he's looking for a couple of other parts and wow look at that in the background this is for sale right now 70k um yeah so it's got a Lemco boost gauge stock steering wheel stock steering wheels and good condition it's got the gray trim gray seats I've got the red trim in this car looks really good you see what I meant about the the other car with the with the gray door cards so he's picked up his car and it's like

(Start: 00:07:08)
I said near stock beautiful beautiful specimen uh this is gonna be a super quick one this is just a single ad this guy's name is Sheldon he's a mechanic in East London he's apparently the best the best in the Eastern Cape area I used to live in Port Elizabeth we had quite a long chat on the phone a couple of months ago I was looking for a starter motor for this car but Dave Brown School managed to sort me out in Durban uh children selling the shell I forget how much it's just around 10 grand it's a writing chassis and it's not gearbox not engine but it's got full suspension uh apparently it's still indecent I can obviously the bumpers hangers the only picture I have that's all I know about the car it's still listening to Facebook right now okay this one I found on JDM Collective um this car has been sold it's a questionable color uh looks like it was quite a neat spray job but it's a it's a facelift so it's 99 2000 model coilovers there's no info that actually

(Start: 00:08:08)
States anything about the vehicle and your model and all that stuff so it's got a front lip it's got fog lamp covers um stock gt wearing stock tail lights a lot of mileage the sixth also pretty questionable I don't know what three schedules could be a lamco that is cool that is super super cool I've been looking for one of those to be honest I think this car used to be blue or I don't know it's just probably actually carpets from maybe an Str or something I'm looking for one of these on overseas in Japan don't find one in the next couple of months I'm just gonna throw a triple gauge pod in the center it's got a stock cluster on the car I mean it's a good looking car I mean good parts on the car color question but we'll move on we'll move on

(Start: 00:09:10)
we should be chopping through the uh this car was for sale for 30 grand here we go sold 30 grand so this is an STI I don't think it was ever in STI it's got fog lamps in it um but it's definitely a GC I'd had papers I saw this only when it got sold that's why I have an image of saying sold and it was unfortunate because I hadn't yet found and bought this car so this would have probably been a better base than this car but it is what it is JDM tail lights he's got the same Wing that I've got in this car right now better Wheels probably a better engine definitely a better engine yeah 30 grand I'm not sure but I've done some like Facebook stalking on this particular sale and this went to it either came from or

(Start: 00:10:11)
sold to him I'm not sure uh Zed works the guys in Cape Town and he does a lot of rally stuff he's got a red uh gc8 as well I'm not sure if he sold it or if he bought it this was for sale for a very long time like we're talking months now okay let's hear this is a real deal STI this is what I was talking about these are those uh fog covers I dig these like the square-ish type of this cost to sell for about 185 or 190k somewhere around there four months a lot of months um it didn't dropped to 125 if I'm not mistaken and then it disappeared the next day probably he probably got it off it was very high what he was asking actually 180 190k extremely hard but take a look at this

(Start: 00:11:11)
car 16s these original ones that came on the car I pretty sure it had coilovers on them that drop is just a bit too aggressive for a stock stock car but look at this STI embroidered seats these are standard on this car look how neat the boot area all the boot trim and all that stuff okay mine's popping out here so is so was that car I stripped up a bit um I think it's just a common thing where it kind of just pops out there but everything else is just super neat Momo race stereo the same one I had my R32 GTR this is a pre-facelift interior that I was talking about earlier like on this car you'll find so we've got that Dash thing over there these buttons are all over here uh it's it's vastly different it's it's a lot more modernized on here plus these airbags and all that stuff which I'm doing an airbag delete on this one I've ordered that JDM pocket uh so it's like a cubby hole top thing that replaces the airbag over there that's on the way

(Start: 00:12:12)
um there's actually a lot of stuff this is quite exciting and you stop talking about that because that's just supposed to be in the background now this well I said I was quite kind of set I think I did say it was thinking on my head but it's sold like this and at 125k really not not a bad deal at all um he probably accepted a little bit less maybe 120 115 and I just I wish I wish I'd gotten this it looks neat I don't know what the mileage was but look at that it's got proper ej207 uh it'll be a Egypt 207k stock STI articular stock Term 12 setup flaky intake paint that's normal stock radiator but anything that's not stuck on here is the intake

(Start: 00:13:14)
and that's it oh it does have coilovers there we go you can see I think those are like ISC coilovers or something but anyway um it's it's doing the costume Justice it damn so this thing sold I was rather Bleak about that uh this one another color found the JDM Collective I don't know how much this one sold for but questionable questionable trim hood scoop it's hot mirrors wing uh yeah big exhaust on the car which is great I think it's an hk7 our power um Momo steering wheel it looks a bit odd though there's the dash pocket that's what I was referring to earlier so that's an airbag delete thing so I've got one that's coming for this car um I don't know what the story is in this car but it's a tibetama it's got the gray trim

(Start: 00:14:17)
I don't know anything about this car there were no details just pictures again color same as us but questionable true moving on [Music] ah this one's still for sale there's not many pictures uh these drop the price so it's sitting in 95k now he was asking 145 silly money so this car was for sale probably like two three weeks before that other silver STI the real deal Str sold for 40 grand less plus minus but this is not like anything special so the asking price is too high he seems like quite a serious Subaru man he's got a couple others in the background but I think we all are we I mean I've got three now I've got another one outside but I mean this is my 12th Superior and it's kind of like an addiction and

(Start: 00:15:20)
um pretty sure they're a lot more is like me because I'm I come across these for sale ads and the guy's got another two three in the background maybe I'll just work on them I don't know see there I think that was for sale as well known as gfx for sale it doesn't say much in the car just number matching car with the engine number and the chassis and all that uh pre-fi slot that's all I can tell you and then there's the silver one the silver one there was only one picture and he wanted that the car disappeared I don't know two three weeks after it got listed I have a Super GT for sale car is well looked after sold with right with the compliance 130k on the clock pretty fast left again coilovers smoked out smoked out smoked out

(Start: 00:16:20)
it's miked out on a heavy tent I don't know anything about this car gf8 it does the same do the JDM one with the JDM gc8 I forget what the asking price is on us but he's dropped it now he's dropped it to 65k probably Tech 55 around there there's just something weird about this car okay so it's got a 20g let's just go to the ad go to 20g it's got a bigger it's cooler it's got a bigger hood scoop on it HKS dump valve it's got a walbro 450. uh high and low boost is I wonder if he's doing it through the ECU or this controller he's a 76 uh pop all the way to the back uh but I don't know what bozie needs some touch-ups body he must mean body but he needs to touch up so he's in eastern Springs okay so this car is cool

(Start: 00:17:21)
but there's something that weirds me out about this car so it's sitting on the coilovers which is awesome um I think I may have started laugh as an ni model kind of like this thing there's no events in here now gf8 turbo did have vents okay so that's that's the first weird problem this the second and third see it's got multiple Subarus these are about four okay what the hell is this about so it's got Scooby on here and it's going to mile per hour Dash was this an import like from the UK I don't know second weird thing it's got high and low range okay I know that it does work with the clutch and manual and all that stuff but I don't think it came on this model I'm pretty sure it wasn't an N A version I'll never know

(Start: 00:18:22)
oh this car was cool it was also sitting for sale for a very very long time 18 weeks and I took this picture I don't know five weeks before it actually disappeared off the internet ah very rarely limited now this car makes me sad because it is actually a v limited edition it is I wouldn't say rare rare but it's limited and there were just some things that were done to the car that I mean okay don't get me wrong I'm all about modifying I'll modify this shitbox I'll cut this thing up I'll do whatever I won't cut this thing up oh the Bottom's open just realized I won't Cut That Thing Up but I'll modify it Tastefully which I have been doing I've been throwing on HKS Grady Bloods a pixie zero sport all the name brands okay it is really a v limited it's got all the badges

(Start: 00:19:22)
that's my wheel wow these gauges those are from autostyle these are like cheapy Auto style Auto auto gauge gauges something like a I mean they work they do the job but you know it's cool to throw on a different car and nothing wrong with them but not for this you've got to go period specific real JDM kit my cupboard there's full of the stuff and I can chop and check so if I want the Blitz in there which you'll see over there I got a blood so I'll throw a Grady on here I'm not going to throw it auto gauge gauge in it okay so first question I bought and what is that the steering wheel is a little bit lame uh the Momo one I don't know what that is I think it could be a turbo timer I'm not too sure the gear knob are completely height and then look at this it legit is a 1995 fee limited it was one of something here's the old door cards so our current

(Start: 00:20:23)
door cards have got all the switches on here it's got like a whole switch panel this is all this is proper pre-facelift stuff in Durban cars sitting on coilovers completely blacked out I feel bad so the 832 out of a thousand and then it's got this it's got a front mount it's cooler fun that's okay but then like not look after I mean flaky paint it's like you pop your engine made it show it off and like that one pop my angel mode for anybody on this car don't ask me to show you this thing yes cool that I would have cleaned it up look at the Bonnet bonus full of Gunk and ah anyway this cost sold I'm assuming it's sold well um look like I'm like completely in love with this car but I would have wanted to restore it and

(Start: 00:21:26)
get it back to what it what it was within this form of Glory like I said questionable stuff from there this one another water there's a lot of waters so this one's still for sale right now um I'm not sure what the story is now but he wanted originally 100K for the car he's got some very tasteful stuff on there there's no engine mount picture at all he's got a gt35 turbo so I can only assume it's been rotated it's a rotate mount kit for the front mount intercudo there's a wastegate on it there's a GE ready house it's a Grady dumbbell it's coilovers on the car there's racing seeds with four point harness uh Str tail lights or tail lights on both these cars flip boot spoiler and a decent mileage you've earned the car for 12 years this car is awesome looking it is Pristine from what I can see in the pictures it's a real stunner I'm not sure why your veins are black and your hood

(Start: 00:22:26)
Skipper's black um I guess you're trying to do like a contrast between colors with the lip and and all that stuff I mean it looks pretty good it's very much slammed there and then the back looks like a monster truck but yeah those cars for sale right now he wants at 100K I don't know whether you would want for it now but it is for sale and there's no interior effects I think I'm looking at it now I don't think those are the OEM seats no I think the seats have been changed out and I don't know I don't know it's a good price but if you'll probably drop it more his looks like his missus is also listing the car for him I think he said he's immigrating do you say that

(Start: 00:23:28)
relocating okay so it's a shame you're selling uh bumpers hanging there at the back 12 Years a long time long time to let go sorry I'll let go of my GTR after mine it was the longest I've ever owned a car before oh there's two two white ones left this is very pretty this one for my stock it's got WRX wheels from a 2000 and uh 2003 WRX and then it's got the OEM tail lights in it the wing doesn't belong to this car that's from a later model like a 2011 somewhere around there it doesn't look bad just look for me this thing is pretty stuck it's got double din radio which looks like it came over even from another

(Start: 00:24:28)
vehicle I'm not sure my wheel is the same trim and I've got the red trim and this car these probably came off the production line at a similar time cool car great car I don't know how much it sold for they didn't list it and then this thing this sold very quickly as well forget the price 200k I don't know what it's all for maybe like 180 ish is it not negotiable maybe do so sold after three days a lot of work went to this thing so uh it's very nice to have and it is the only one that you say with a flat twin turbo dictator management spend lots of money it's an eye catcher blah blah blah look at that look at that bay just go straight to the edge of bed look at this that is some serious proper Fab work it looks amazing really really really dig that

(Start: 00:25:31)
um the front is strange those covers are strange but I'm I guess you're doing it for a reason with regards to airflow or something I don't know um yeah nice nice wing and just good everything good rad heart Etc clean shaved engine bay and that's that's what I want to do in this car I want to get the engine by shaved and all that stuff get rid of all the animation series stuff after I pop the engine and we're gonna go wild and swallowed a jazz out keep talking about this it excites me because I can do it was so cheap I could I can do whatever I want with it now um great car oh well I didn't notice that it's like a wide body this is a custom wide body with the fenders and all the back skin good job man okay this is the last one for the night I think this is like number 16 or 17. this car

(Start: 00:26:31)
is for sale again okay what I'm about to show you first this is from the original owner cars for sale about April mid April plus minus wasn't for sale for long I found it the day after and it's in wine red I don't particularly like the color but it is what it is you can always spread it and change the ridge this costs for sale in Vanderbilt Park uh 65k Mr Barry on and it's got those really lame tail lights aftermarket I don't know why you change that it's got a memo steering wheel uh it's got a cover on it terrible it's got terrible carpets uh it's got a 3 16 mil 3 gauge holder and then it's got the not it's not the facelift it's not

(Start: 00:27:32)
the face stuff but the what threw me off right now is the the boot there there's a lot of cosmetic damage to this car a lot um Bodywork I don't think it's dented badly I can't really see much but I mean look at that look at that it's it's not pretty so it needs some reupholstery work as well uh it does it is a GT it's definitely a turbo model however I think this has been transplanted from another car he said here that this is an fa20 and I've put up where is it now turbo inbox when first change the ad so I've got it I've got a three day one there we go found it so you listed it initially for that and then you listed it turbo invoices there so you put the f820 motor then it says

(Start: 00:28:33)
stage two to 48. this is probably a vf48 turbo and I don't know if you meant ej20 or is it an fa20 but this don't look right so if there's any specialists in here like this engine could be from a very early WRX where the turbo is doing exactly what it's doing there or a newer model fa20 because generally your intake or Inlet pop would be coming out of here it's very confusing it's not these the engine that came with the car it's not a uj20 like come in there right that's the original owner like I said that was April then the car landed up with this person and it's for sale right now again and he listed the car I think for 75k

(Start: 00:29:35)
and he's dropped it now to 60 five I think 65. but it's got some issues uh we didn't see that earlier fuel pressure regulator he's fixed some stuff allegedly uh some a couple other things um roof liner is sagging very badly um same story it needs a respray and all that goodness but it's got a big pop in it it's got the lyrics wheels on it from a 2003 plus those horrible horrible Lots on the back um It's Still rocking that terrible cover and those horrible that's dangerous dude it's been pushed up you might get caught you might get caught when you're trying to break um yeah Okay so I don't know I'm spending a lot of time on this because he's he listed it it's missing a breakout he listed it

(Start: 00:30:36)
I think like a month after he sold it so there's either something horribly wrong at the car or there's some sort of an issue but it's the same car look at the number plate dh62 HH if you go back to Leon's one dh62 HH same card I don't know why Celine again his missus has also listed the car for him or on his behalf um actually no I might be wrong that was probably that white one but somebody's listed the he listed it twice or something like that and he's got two ads running for this particular vehicle uh with slightly different picks I think these pictures from both ads there was actually a picture of him in the car wearing a yellow first card and I've decided not just save that in this folder so I don't show you guys um yeah so my thoughts on this car it's been a long time with it because it's still available and it's it's suspect that it's for sale again so quickly like I said could maybe there's nothing wrong with

(Start: 00:31:36)
the car maybe nothing serious well I'm spending a lot of time on it because I think this is a really good deal figure out what the story is with that engine if it's legit and it's got paperwork and it is a proper I don't know either 20K or if you're a 20 year who cares but as long as it's working boosting cars driving nasty you know that sort of stuff um all this other stuff is cosmetic and I think for that price if you get it maybe possibly slightly less then I think you in for a bargain and getting yourself in the hot seat of one of these bad boys and just feeling some Nostalgia and JDM power from back in the day so anyway that's it for the video uh no hate to any of these owners on any of the mods it's just my personal preference and I love these cars like I said I love every single one I love maroon red one if I was allowed to this Marine red one would be sitting in my drive right now I don't have the

(Start: 00:32:37)
garage space right now but it would be sitting with me so that is it for the video I hope you guys enjoyed this it's taking me a couple months just to collect all these vehicles kind of stalkerish I know I'm gonna keep doing this and uh maybe we'll meet again in six months time with another batch of gc8 but if you guys want me to do some other vehicles you let me know and for now take care peace see you in the next one [Music] thank you

(Start: 00:01:00)
pictures and all that it looks really really really good so let me show you guys some stuff um I kind of went and got in ahead with those two and I primered and painted up we did that in the previous video I didn't see much but anyway here's look what it used to look like and that's what it looks like now but I still need to be standards some more and prepped and all that stuff check this out this is like fully done in the previous video I hadn't shown you guys sorry a previous video I hadn't finished this so this is like perfectly smooth they aligned hundreds full fiberglass um scoopers in it's it's a bit different so scoop kind of lives on top versus I don't know if you can see with the plastic yeah you can see versus that but like it's Factory and then okay this looks very crappy because I'm still busy I'm not finished yet but I fabricated some brackets myself I'm I'm such after I was actually able to do all this stuff myself uh fabricated put some bolts in I

(Start: 00:02:02)
need to get a shorter bolt that one I didn't couldn't find another short one uh fiberglass needs to be cleaned up same story right here that I haven't done that so it looks good on top I'm I don't feel like doing this right now I will get to it that was with that mesh and stuff this one's also got a little bit of mesh under there didn't feel like getting to it I will get to it has a dodgy intake from the last video hey this I picked up for this um which I probably wouldn't end up using on this car uh we'll see um I do want to Turbo this thing in a tube I've got to turn around the cupboard I've got most of this paper I actually get down pop which I think I found one now anyway that's I don't know why that's it but anyway I don't know what I want to show you guys that's what I want to show you guys so I repaired this section here not complete yet I'm almost done um I was actually just messing around a little snot mounted yet see um I'm going to loosen those and put this on that but that's my distribution

(Start: 00:03:04)
block we've just got a copper piece on it so it's just literally just linking one two three that's it so that's the small wires on the side that goes to the starter motor and stuff and then there's the rest of the wiring harness Loom and that red one all the way at the back in there well this is not done yet yeah we'll get to it and then it popped up there and it's mmm [Music] trying to get their weight distribution on point plus also sneaking up this engine but I want to get this engine bay looking really good I want to close up a lot of the holes but not yet so when I do that whole engine swap so remember I want to blow this thing first or just get it to its limit and if it doesn't blow then eventually just pull it out and I want to throw in an ej22 so like this ej207 ej205 uh not this crappy thing when it's in I'm going

(Start: 00:04:06)
to deal with you know blocking the holes and where all the grommets were and I want to do some more cable deletes and all that stuff but now I've got two really cool mods that I want to show you guys the first one because if you follow me on Instagram you really know this oh it's dark outside I'm not open the garage door this is a sea West bumper like original you not see West bumper I got this from a scrapyard in Durban uh the week that I was leaving to Jeffrey's Bay so funny story this all came off a single car these lights the dirty and lights the the lots of the it's all from the type order the boot the actual lid the lats the bumper the full brakes which are in the cupboard no I'm lying in that cupboard the suspension which is

hold down here there needs to be full of refurbed over it that needs to be thrown on that and a whole bunch of other stuff all belong to this car at a scrapyard in Durban and now funny story I'll end up buying all the stuff lights beatings um I picked up the the vents and the script from Japan all that stuff in like August now when did I get this car I only got the car in December it was like meant to happen and funny all the stuff was already blue okay this car doesn't need to respray they're all different colors blue different shades of blue but it kind of like I didn't know I was getting this I'd never thought I'd ever get an inner one and especially one that I could butcher but it really a lot of stars aligned and I'll end up getting this car anyway it's got original cos bumper I've got a fake I wouldn't be steering wheel on here um actually I learned our buyings from a company called tokyotoms.com and the

(Start: 00:06:08)
pricing looked good it showed OMP it's Sid or MP and it had the emblem at the bottom and the steering wheel had their own pee stuff and then they sent me this crap anyway I'm not one to complain I don't want to commit it works I've like actually tried bending it like pulling it on both sides and I won't break it easily and so it's not like eBay eBay cheap or the AliExpress or Alibaba cheap cheap but it's cheap and it'll work yeah I did the whole thing with camera strip the whole dash to Pieces uh rip the clock spring out the steering wheel came out airbag all that stuff disconnected and everything works and hunky dory it's actually a quick release but I've locked it in place so the quick release doesn't work so that is an Audio Dynamics uh fuse distribution block takes a l fuses and I've already put one in the center I don't know if I'm going to leave it in the center um we'll see so I'll put like incoming

(Start: 00:07:10)
here on the copper where my thumb is and then that will go for incoming it'll be the battery where my thumb is and then the top one will be going off to that long lead that you guys saw in the back so this is this is going to go in the back I'll probably throw a kill switch in there as well I'm having ordered the kill switch I was actually contemplating should I put a kill switch in there with like one of those um automatic kill switches with the 300 M switches on it and it's got a manual lever as well so if I don't want to kill the battery think about putting that in the boot and then onto that and then it comes all the way back here to that distribution box I'm trying to do things properly not like my GTR and stuff like that that uh protect speaker it was crap I'll put speaker fuses and obviously anyway let's get cracking on this thing

(Start: 00:08:10)
no no teeth [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music]

(Start: 00:09:31)
[Music] connected  yourself [Music] okay so it's a couple weeks later after I finished the suspension I actually ended up doing all four I didn't do all of it on camera just at the rear I figured it would be much of the madness um it actually didn't turn out great now

(Start: 00:10:32)
while the reasoning for that is I kind of broke a brake line um properly broke one it was a super tight full of rust I was trying to get the spanner story and bang it with a hammer and it'll end up twisting the hard line and it completely snapped anyway I found a place in a town called humansdorp humansdorp someone like that and I'll end up driving there and I went to a company called Delco brake and clutch sorted within like five minutes God sorted me out the car's done so the thing I need to do is beat the brakes I I can't do it on my own I've been waiting for my wife to like come and help me she doesn't have a gap right now we'll sort of that sitting slightly lower like ever so slightly lower it's like four fingers in there versus maybe seven previously I know measurements pretty crappy but the back sits a lot lower than the front I think it looks a lot better than what

(Start: 00:11:34)
it used to also like previously I could could literally go like this right now it is bouncing up and down a little bit if I built in this car this thing don't move at all like nothing it's like a pile of bricks like this I can get it with those but not as bad I got to put a lot of force into this previously with the old suspension I could bounce this thing up a bit like properly open now so I want to talk quickly events are done uh change these things out I put silver ones on I got the blue looking blue I just got some spray paint black spray paint a spray all over here uh this one got damaged a little bit I need to sorted out that one's perfect like really really good so why I got the blue sprayer it's really for those

(Start: 00:12:36)
this was looking really poop we are where I filled it up so now that I've just run it with some almost matching blue spray paint it looks better I mean I'm because I'm gonna respray anyway I figured why not oh hang on I need to show you guys something check this out it's complete candles lacking hands yeah there we go I got that cable in your shortened I ran out of lug so I couldn't shorten this so I kind of just tucked it in the back there that one I need to pin down but that thing's in that's melting properly this is melted and properly it's not going anywhere battery is a little bit smaller I want to get a bigger battery for the car and then there's my ground cable that goes in there and it works it works beautifully all right there's my 1K Fuller I was

(Start: 00:13:37)
looking for that so yeah battery is done check the front it's a beautiful card in the way okay that's really light come on it's coming forwards that's it go back of course you can't see now that's like properly done I've repaired the whole thing there's no lights in the front or back where are we we're in the back of my garage right now or from the garage um yeah I fixed it all up it's been painted black uh it actually looks really good but not quite sure you guys I don't know I'm fine with the camera I mean Flash

(Start: 00:14:41)
oh these are really old school but I figured it's the right area for this car we're getting there we're getting there and you fill this up glitter I forgot the beading there's the beading throw the beading on and then I want to get this car sprayed I want to get this car sprayed like in the next three four months damn it's getting there I just want to get these in so anyway that's the progress in the car uh lots to happen so lots going on still and we may be getting a sponsor in one versus just stopped charging awesome I may be getting a sponsor on it's cool so let's see how that goes I'm not gonna let the cat out of the bag just yet but some exciting stuff going on anyway getting darker on the side who cares thank you so much for watching the video I'll see you all in the next one peace

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up girls and welcome back to the channel finally had my parts arrived from Durban like a whole bunch of them that I needed for she's suspension for brakes whatever anyway let me just show you instead of talking so all the stuff came off a WRX type ra the same the very same car that I got these tail lights from the bootlet from a bunch of other stuff I've got a fender these I believe came off an Str V5 V6 so I got all four uh this one's been cleaned up as best as I could um looks looks okay I think the spring rates and everything and it seems like there's still gas inside it I can't physically move it slowly clean those up I sort of stripping the brake calipers um and I threw them inside a box of vinegar [Music]

(Start: 00:01:00)
so I've got eight liters of vinegar in here and I think it did the job let's take a look let's have a look see so it's a bean in here for approximately four days now uh did two days on the bottom and then I flipped it and then the two days in the top will definitely help look at all that raster cam off here it's only some of it I poured all the stuff out and a lot of trunks fell off but it's definitely looking a lot better when I was picking it up and touching it a lot of us was falling off so I'm stucked [Music] I am so impressed with this have a look at this this is just from a quick wash I have a wire wheel I haven't done anything um it just kind of wopped off and I put some clean green or degreaser

(Start: 00:02:00)
whoever man that's awesome okay I'm gonna do this off cam I'm gonna wire wheel and just clean all this up and then I want to show you guys some other stuff off cam did a little bit of stuff off cam uh I don't know I was just having like one of those weeks I didn't feel like picking up the camera I just wanted to do me just wanted to do the car and that's that so uh excuse the mess in the garage but I want to show you guys a few things so obviously I picked up a whole bunch of pots my parents dropped them off for me amazing so they brought them a thousand kilometers so from a thousand kilometers away so super grateful for that excuse the mess okay I haven't set up everything properly this is not supposed to be where it is right now and yeah should mess everywhere but I'm upgrading my little workshop area so I've now got an angle grinder finally I've got a bench grinder with a wire wheel in it this thing's fixed the table of us and then I've got this I've got a drill press I don't know exactly where I want to put

(Start: 00:03:01)
it yet I've still got a bunch of Furnitures I have to build it's like been a little while build a furniture and I'm thinking about putting a table there just a square with some legs a steel table putting the drill press on top of that so I can fabricates though and then also got a cheap welder this welder is not going to be for exhausts and that sort of stuff I'm going to try fabricate some brackets so remember in the first or second video I showed you guys don't exactly match up so I can get the fronts so that section over there and that section over there that can match up that doesn't so that needs to attach to that hole and then that one needs to attach it it just doesn't line up at all so I need a focus on the back I'm going to be cutting my own plates uh I've got steel plates already some way yeah amongst all my ship I've got a steel plates I'm gonna be cutting the plates I'm going to be drilling and welding it myself and then I did one more thing off cam that's

(Start: 00:04:01)
super cool how far is this okay cut the hole made it simpler on this car first if you guys can see in the picture it's a template it's pretty simple because it's the same Bonnet so I made a template from here follow this line all the way up to about there and we're going across down and then yeah got the vent layout and all that stuff my little template did the same thing went from here up across got it on scribed it that one uh was actually a lot easier so what do you call those things the the washers from the washers I mean they're exactly the same on that card did measurements from the washers made a template from the washer from the end of the Bonnet to the washers down described it and ready to go so look they sit flush it's not like the OEM Bonnet the iron Bonnet looks like this is a little bit different whatever I think it looks cool it's cheaper than me paying 10 000 Plus for a

(Start: 00:05:03)
new bonnet [Music] this heart is [Music]

(Start: 00:06:04)
thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:07:07)
thank you so at this point I decided that I'm gonna piece all of the parts that I had in the cupboard to make up some dodgy intake now my freaking microphone decided to stop working uh probably because I dropped my entire camera I ended up kicking my uh tripod the whole thing fell the camera Plastics broke and the microphone just yeah went for a bowl of yeah I didn't know it broke and I filmed a whole lot of stuff so anyway this is me putting together the intake I did a bunch of ravings thought of the car you know it sounds like a VW polo with an intake you know there's not much because I got stock exhaust got cats it's got silencers this huge I don't know if huge is Rod it's got a big back box but not the good kind of

(Start: 00:08:10)
big and it's blocking a lot of the cool sounds so it's just doing this dumping noise like on the intake I can't make the noise um anyway I thought of that and then I filmed a whole lot more just to show you guys like what I've been doing and blah blah blah you'll see it now in the videos there's just no audio and I only figured it out when I was editing luckily it was only like the third quarter of the recording but anyway um so that's the story I'm going to end the video here um it's been a little while and uh I don't know I just haven't a chance to edit to be honest I've been having so much fun working in the car that I just haven't been editing that's not honest truth uh so anyway thanks so much for watching I'll see you guys in the next one peace

Title: PROJECT GC8 : Worse than I thought!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sL9wl9J1pk

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome back to another episode of project con square box uh yeah so I landed up doing probably about six hours of work without filming um it was just really boring work there's so many issues with the car you can probably see one already there this car is full of body filler like full I cannot stress to you how bad it is let's just jump straight into it it's bad okay fortunately for me this is gonna be a track car so it's not like I'm not really upset about it and I paid literally nothing for this car okay got issues on the roof here they fill this thing up with I don't know some like aluminum sheeting I put pop rivets in it's already broken they fill this whole thing up with just body full of hair so I can see from what it looks like and we're putting a magnet as well it looks like about that much over there is body filler actually probably about that and it's body Fuller the rest of it is all metal

(Start: 00:01:00)
um like I said I'm not too concerned about the whole thing this is mostly original until you get here from there here look that is body Fuller and Metal because it was been like six hours because the Trump's not the boot alignment luckily I've got this so I'm trying to yeah use my eye and figure everything out but I managed to get the Gap rod and I managed stuck it's not perfect I've had to use washers on the on their arms and and all that but I managed to sort of beat up they open the garage so you guys can see okay so my alignment is I would say 90 there it's it's good like on this side just here sitting just a little bit too low and I just need to put something on it uh you know bump stock thing I'm missing that one here so if I put those on that this car has things should be good um there's no Shield over the body

(Start: 00:02:02)
so like I said this is this is not great um so they did yeah which I had to chip out so much filler inside here it was just it was literally packed up to the window and then here so the bottom it wasn't closing properly the bottom was sitting really high on this side if you look at this they went high high and then they went low it's real real crap so I'm going to probably fill this with like fibro gel and aluminum uh sheet and not element Machining that aluminum mesh just raise it up it doesn't have to be perfect it'll be my little DIY thing but look look how bad the inside of the boot is this is really crap they use that zika Flex glue just everywhere and that's such a pain to get off like you can't peel this is on here properly at that really really really tough stuff

(Start: 00:03:04)
um you can see it's been it's been jacked up here and hurt body fill in here and then like these little edges they were just packed with with body filler and packed with that Seeker flex stuff I've got the original um everything's here so I'm going to put everything back after cleaning all this up and like making it look decent making sure there's a good seal also the windows loose but look here 's the aluminum I was talking about Chelsea's straight I mean it was literally standing uh during the floods and that routine all collapsed on on the back side um Glaston break that broke but whatever but yeah with a guy that with a guy had those rubber tracks

(Start: 00:04:05)
um there's some surface rust I thought it'll be worse but there's some surface rust on here but that's because it wasn't sealed properly so the water was getting trapped in there I'm really stoking the interior the interior is in such good Nook we're messing around on sea Trails I need a fabricates and stuff I'll probably pick up a welder and try to do it myself I get some plates uh get these sea Trails on so I can throw those recurras on I tried moving the OEM rails over just didn't it's not going to work so here's the passenger seats this is also passenger seat here's the rail OEM rail they sod mounted ones so it there's just no ways I needed to melt there that's not what it works I'm just going to put everything back together I don't need a passenger seat in there now I don't need back seats I'm Gonna Leave the drivers in for now until I fabricate some rails first things first time I say all the words [Music]

(Start: 00:05:16)
taking things geez the rear of this car so bad rust everywhere this is not safe address okay good idea I could probably get this off that gc8 in Durban and replace it before now  it's a whole bumper support yeah I think I'm gonna have to get a new one jeez yeah there's nothing I can do with this one okay [Music]

(Start: 00:06:33)
okay [Music] baby baby [Music] [Music] pain you baby [Music] check this out I'm pretty much done so

(Start: 00:07:35)
it's like lined up almost even except for that little piece there I just need to fill that a little bit more so the two products I used was this fiber body filler and then I use the 1K fine filler you'll see the this is like 1K fine filler was just to close up the holes and then this darker stuff like that okay I'll put a little bit too much harder than that one but the darker stuff I get is your fiber so there's just two spots that I just need to fill up a little bit more yeah and then it's pretty much even I mean comparison to what it looked like this is a turn better I don't know you see but I got my boot alignment sorted uh put these tail lights back in I'll probably obviously well not probably I will pull everything back out when the car needs a respray but for the most part I want to drive around and do some stuff so I need to tell us [Music]

(Start: 00:08:55)
thank you I've decided on these because these are old school I know a lot of muscle cars put these on and stuff like that but this is like that era of 90s 2000s I didn't really have those pushed down ones that flip up those are a lot cooler and if I had to do something for this car I'd probably put those on not that I'd throw them on it's fine it's open just by the way it looks funny [Music] let's see you know that old saying you get what you pay for I got it I was wondering why there was a an old carpet let me show you this this was lying underneath the battery or the battery was sitting on top of it pull the battery out pull the carpet out gotta find that

(Start: 00:09:55)
yeah remember I haven't inspect this car that's causing them and I was really living in Jeffrey's Bay yeah it sucks so I got a lot to fix so I'm still gonna keep it I don't wonder what the underneath looks like but  I guess for now that means the end of the video um yeah I'll fix it I'll just doing stuff that I didn't want to be doing anyway that's it thank you so much for watching really appreciate it see you all the next one peace

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to a brand new video this is one of those videos where I'm super excited to actually show you guys what I bought the project car and I'm also like pretty embarrassed to show you guys what it is um then before I show you you need to see it or hear this so I'm not going the whole JDM route again with a full full whole JDM route again for a very long time I don't it's not going to be never but it won't be now I want to have fun so I bought this car it's it's a beta it's a box completely box we're gonna do an engine swap but first we're probably gonna blow up the engine that's on there um there's a lot of stuff a lot of stuff that we're going to be doing and I want to track this car it's it's a car it's sa Ridge it's road legal I want to track the car have fun with it just screw around you know just enjoy it because my other cars are like the GTR and the RX7 they were garage Queens they're just set this is something I want to mess around with my gc8 over here that gets Road time but it doesn't get much else so it's running really well and all that I don't know if I want to ever take it out I'll probably will but

(Start: 00:01:00)
not not now I want a beater and I want to screw this thing up so that being said it gives a new project car s [Music] told you it's a freaking box that's my friends is a super impressive gc8 it's not a GT Turbo it's not a WRX and we're not gonna make it one either there's no hood scoop it's got drum brakes on the back but I have good news I've got Replacements I've got all sorts of stuff I've got Scoops I mean come on why the hell would I have all this stuff nobody guessed another gc8 like no one anyway um it's a proper proper beta I got it for next to nothing like cheaper than an engine swap and uh as shitty as it is it's here it's a

(Start: 00:02:03)
cartoon work on it something I can do it's not truly JDM it's Japanese but uh we're gonna make it cool so like I said I'm not going to make it a WRX I'm not going to make it a GT tablet I'm just putting pots on that I think are cool so for example I've got the JDM tail lights here from a type RF it makes the car look cool I'm not trying to make it look like an STI I'm not doing anything on the sword I just want the car to look cool there's a lot of issues on this car it's driving I drove it all the way from PE to Jeffrey's Bay without a staying other than the Bonnet uh wanting to kill me it doesn't have a latch remember I was I haven't already seen this car I saw it for like three hours on I had to go back to Durban for my uncle's funeral and I managed to see the car for a couple hours and that was pretty much it so I've never driven it until today and uh It actually drives okay it's pretty solid so the reason why I got this car like dirt though cheap is because of retaining all fell out uh

(Start: 00:03:04)
there were floods in my old Hometown Durban about a year ago and I retaining wall Came Crashing Down The Back ruined the whole boot um we're in the beatings and a whole bunch of stuff so the back here is not exactly straight I mean something sort that out it does not look like that it'll get there this little it's not from this car it's from WRX type ra uh same place that those uh tail lights came from and everything else I managed to find an actual type RA 1997. in Durban and I pulled a whole bunch of parts for it I got a I'm gonna say it's a side Bond but it's something else I forgot the brand it's a really cool bumper for this car so guys I've got so much stuff a good friend of mine went out of his way and he went to the scrap yard where this car was after I'd already moved and he just picked stuff for me so I've got new fenders coming I've got uh the bootloads already on

(Start: 00:04:06)
from that car there's beatings I've got a new beating I don't know what this guy was thinking but oh you put like rubber track on this car so let's go through the car quicker just so you know there's lots of spares that I've got I've got STL suspension coming I've got full hub assemblies from the STI from a V5 STI full hub assembly front and rear because this car does have drums on it so we're going to do a swap for that uh I don't know if the suspension will keep or not maybe a micro coilover I might throw it on just temporarily we'll see needs a lot of work front end not so bad that was me a kind of tighter rope from the Bonnet to the number plate and through the radiator support and do that on the on the freeway so yeah um but for the most part the front headlights and Grill and front bumpers to look at Bonnet I'm probably going to cut them throw that stuff on the vent over here yeah you know I'm not trying

(Start: 00:05:09)
to show you there but like that I'm gonna make it like that yeah cool how's that space car you know reference car okay fenders this is what I said getting your fingers these fenders are cooked so the retainer will fell hit these fenders here on this side only but I do have two fenders the door's okay fortunately the roof is okay but the beading's got screwed and it's like one long beading piece uh you can see it on that car and that beating stretches all the way in there so it broke here they thought it was screwed sort of threw it away I've got new buildings again the boot is messed up I gotta I gotta sort this out so the alignment's way off in the good um rear bumper is also a bit screwed but I got a new one I got that cybon or whatever it is tail lights I've got all that jazz so it's really we just need to fix this

(Start: 00:06:11)
panel make sure this panel is okay make sure the other side of the pedal is okay doors everything else is solid if you listen to this property solid interior crap because it's obviously it's normally aspirated plans for the interior I don't know yet I know I'm gonna throw those requires in I've got a set of requires there that are refurbed they're going to go and these are going to get tossed uh carpets will probably get redone or removed completely uh back seats I don't know yet maybe I might not keep I've got an open p wheel for the front a quick release all that I've got a bunch of gauges I'm going to throw in here uh fresh uh they put this weird crap there was a double din player like an old one old Pioneer thing I don't know what it was doing in the car it didn't even work so there's no pressure got a new one

(Start: 00:07:13)
we got a sloppy gearbox yeah those gearbox is very similar to the gearbox on the GT um they both made out of glass so it'll probably explode we're gonna run it though um so interior was you know I'm not gonna do a lot I'm gonna get one of those three part gauge holders over there much like what I'm doing on that car and then oh we're gonna track this car for sure that's a definite this is stuck Ariel isn't it I pulled down oh it doesn't matter the car so this is better here's the inner Angel it's pretty shitty that did again better cut job in the interior um I'll enter on the engine man it's all spread black already uh you know there was like no respect of no sanding I just threw it on and hopefully it looks good I mean that painted over the VIN numbers and all that stuff I had to scrape it and look at it yeah I had to scrape that one just to read was on there so annoying so I want to

(Start: 00:08:14)
clean this up engine runs really well I mean the car's got 240 000 kilometers in it it was driving well I drove 130 the whole way off drops hard down the bonnet no issues with the car but it's it's this crap I mean it goes it's like 120 kilowatts but it's boring it's nothing like those so what I'm going to do I'm going to run it like this for a little while I want to get out to the track this elder scrambuncie Raceway in Port Elizabeth not far from me it's 60 kilometers away um I want to get the car to the track but first I want to make it look cool and I'll sort things out there's a lot of stuff on the sword art and I want to get some tractor I want to get some track time as is right now possibly break it and then I had a broad idea I've got spent cooler I've got spare turbos in the cupboard behind me I've got to spare everything I'm going to fold up up it works the only thing I don't have is a turbo down pipe so I was thinking throw a turbo on here run it low boost

(Start: 00:09:16)
I've got I've got some apexy AFR I forgot the super airflow converters so you can wire it in and you can trick the ECU it's basically like a piggyback that's a full JDM piggyback run something stupid like that run a temporary wideband maybe do like an L else lm2 temporarily because I also call just so I can read afrs give it some crappy tune head to the track it's actually that probably below the engine uh run it like low boost because the high compression gaskets and all that running like 0.5 Barbers Point six and then uh have some fun see if I can increase some track times once I blow the engine pick up another ej20 single turbo build it blah blah blah throw it on with the bigger Turbo that's the plan that's what we're gonna do so let's just intro video to the car intro to my shift box and I've got a lot of work coming out and I'm going to be filming it and uh that means frequent content coming up for you guys I'm pretty stoked but I've

(Start: 00:10:16)
got all the good stuff to throw on like beatings I've got new beatings I've got new everything so Keen um all that stuff's in Durban currently and so I can't throw a lot of it on but we'll prep the car my parents are coming here uh in about two to three weeks plus minus and they're luckily for me driving my dad's got a Bucky he's got a double cab so he's gonna throw all this in the back the hubs the suspension and it's literally complete suspension from a WRX type or an rt7 um oh sorry the suspensions from an Str V5 there's a long story it's mix and match stuff you'll you'll see when it's here I'm stoked thank you guys for watching I hope you'll stay on because it's not true JDM but I'm gonna be spinning Spinners uh let me know what tools I should be getting for this stuff I've got engine stand I've got a lot of tools I've started picking up a lot more power tools instead of hand tools and I'm just gonna get cracking probably in the next day or two and just make a list start stripping and have some fun

Title: MY00 Subaru Impreza GT Turbo (GC8 WRX) WALK AROUND
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amspWGfs_ic

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the official walkaround video of my 2000 Subaru Impreza GT Turbo so I bought this car in November of 2021. that year was a pretty tough year for me we decided we're going to leave the country we sold all of our majerium cars we as and my wife and I we decided some to go we're going to sell up everything thus I'll end up picking up because I went through a little bit of a depression stage I had nothing to do I had no cost to work on the cars that I did still have for sale I didn't want to play with them I didn't want to do anything broken you know I couldn't sell them after it so then they're picking this car why did I buy a Subaru well honestly I kind of felt like I didn't do justice to them when I did own them this is my 10th Subaru 11's outside it's one of these cars that I keep going back to I say or I used to say I don't like them they're trash blah blah blah but it's because are treated them badly a blue I break a lot of things I broke

(Start: 00:01:02)
gearboxes multiple engines multiple engines due to negligence on my part not checking oil stupid silly things um cartoon on the coast and then smashed it up and and joburg which is high altitude um that's that's sort of silly stuff and I'll end up breaking a lot of these cars so anyway while I said I I kind of want to pay homage to the car again I don't know if that's the right word but I felt like I needed Justice for these vehicles in my own way because I never did when I was a kid and when I say I was a kid I was earning them from I don't even know how old I would have been 23 maybe a 24 years old and I was picking these things up abusing them yeah it wasn't cool so you've seen pictures just flicking through right now

(Start: 00:02:03)
of the cars that I used to and there's only some this is number ten I'm gonna try and keep it for as long as possible or forever I know there's someone one of you guys you said it's Dad earned it you used to own it I'm not so there I'm not gonna sell it for a long time I'm probably gonna try and keep it forever and my my kids love the car my son sits in his car every single day he refuses to go in the Forester outside or the Lexus until he sits in his car and he'll sit in this car for five minutes anyway I'm rambling waffling let me show you guys the car okay let's talk about the exterior before we move on it's been re-sprayed it was in a horrible horrible condition when I picked up the car someone decided to roll these arches and they're rolled in really badly like I don't know where the monkey wrench or some stupid they're a roll horrifically I had them sorted out they're not perfect but hey a lot lot better the car has been resprayed in its original color it's looking damn good the only thing I haven't done is it was kind of rushing I

(Start: 00:03:04)
thought I was leaving to Portugal which I said and he'll understand so but it's got a lot of orange peels and it was re-spried but it was never cut and Polished and all that stuff so I still need to get it off to a detailer just get them sorted out good Sean I was thinking about doing it myself but I don't have the time I'm gonna have the energy I'm busy with other things I've got the project car on the way which officially left Durban today it's on the way with the trucking company and we'll be here in a few days so my gc8 it's on stock breaks stock Brakes in front stock Brakes in the rear it's got Slots of discs in the in the front it's sitting on 17s these are 225 45 17s they're Bridgestone potenses r e o o three zero zero three the semi slugs really good tires very grippy I've driven them in the rain actually manageable in the rain I don't know if it's because of the all-wheel drive but they're decent you know a lot of cars of this era you know Evolution so you've got saggy bumpers you've got saggy headlights the headlight alignment all

(Start: 00:04:05)
these cars are the changes this design off to the gc8 where it was one full molded headlight as opposed to two piece thing so you can see alignments off yeah it's it's a bit floppy it's only been held on by one screw at the top there like somewhere over there and then it just kind of slots in and push it in there and it's that's it really pray and hope that it stays on causing life support um so this one is less movie but yeah anyway car looks great I decided to leave the pink sticker on or front emblem whatever it's got Stock hood scoop stock vents my shelf has also got a stock let's scoop and Vince um it's got clear indicators on a look at all the boring stuff when I received this car when I bought the car rather roof a black paints nut it was missing driver's side beating this is a brand new beating the front beating was mangled like super ass mangled that

(Start: 00:05:07)
thing actually ended up flying off the car and that's a new one um the rear of the car it's got a Str V6 wing on the back it's probably a replica what it does have though is the JDM tail lights on it so these these tail lights mostly came on special editions and all the JDM Cars when I say special edition special editions around the world but 90 of the JDM Cars came like that that's pretty much it for the exterior I've got the V6 Wing I know there's a 2000 for the last of the last I've got the STI covers in the front so no fogs fogs have been removed and that's it styling worry I don't know I think it's cool you guys might think it's boring oh yeah one more one more thing on the exterior is the apexy exhaust in the back that thing is awesome it's loud but it's manageable it's not droney I have this piece of crap that was on the car before

(Start: 00:06:09)
piece of craps in my cupboard here this thing okay so this it's heavy it's like super heavy compared to the apexy but that crap was on the con was just draining like Freeway highway drone noise a lot of and I was not nice to drive around so that's it that's it for the exterior then inside the car we've got a lot of fingerprints that's for my kid he's only he's almost three actually I was gonna say two and a half um interior GT turbos came with these seats they either came with a gray or the red I've got the red actually kind of like the red it suits I don't have carpets at all I don't know where they are I need to buy some it's like one of those things like should I spend 160 dollars two hundred dollars on brewed carpets or or OEM gc8 carpets so she'll throw money at something else and you know what I always choose something else because I'm a cake so I don't have carpets I need to get

(Start: 00:07:09)
carpets I know all it's got the mama wheel on it this is stock on these uh particular ones got the airbag there's an airbag on the passenger side as well and everything works in the interior I've got the stock OEM gear on Albertson that actually wasn't in good condition I've sorted it out it's decent same as a steering wheel if you look up close someone's been chewing on that now another thing in the interior this happens to a lot of the cars and it's mostly because of the Sun you see that that thing cracked that that thing cracked like two weeks after I bought the car it cracks I don't know maybe me leaving it in the sun I closed it one day and I think my sunglasses were in there and the sunglasses were just pitched a little bit too high and boom that whole thing cracked and broke um I glued it back together but it's not going to be a permanent fixture because I'm gonna get one of those gauge pods in it you know the ones with the 60 mil holders or the 52 those look pretty cool I'm gonna throw them in the car and throw in some awesome gauges so what else do we have on the car uh let's look at the rear first before I

(Start: 00:08:10)
show you guys a little toys in there by the way my Dash is hanging for good reason I'll show you in a sec why it's hanging rear of the car stock seats nothing really to talk about it's got a cigarette burner which is unfortunate I need to stitch it up I mean those are cars at cigarette Burns I'll stitch them up you can't see them I'm gonna give it a shot on these it was actually pretty simple with the requires I just pushed I cut a little bit of fabric from underneath the seat to press it in but first push some foam in press the fabric in and I was thinking about doing fabric period but it ended up sewing and all that shows my door cards my door cards are really good neck as you can see that my tint is not my tent got in I packed this car stuffed when I was moving it was like literally I had up to here I could barely see out the background I had stuff on the back parcel shelf I I it was full like you could not fit any one other than myself in here it was literally a wall up from the center from the handbrake I could only use the handbrake barely

(Start: 00:09:12)
slide my hand to the handbrake I had to pull my apexy power FC hand controller away this is when I moved to Jeffrey's Bay from Durban I loaded this car up with like expensive tough stuff not tough stuff from the garage you know tools whatnot I loaded up the Lexus and I just piled up everything my dad and I drove the two cars sheesh pulled it up anyway we made it and because of everything was so full I had some um like rods that go into the ground for a swim like a kitty swing just to stop the swing from moving and the rods were sitting like over here and they just learned the cutting the tent I need to get the sort of I've got that proper JDM style rear only tint fronts no tent it used to have turned to pull it off JDM style it's awesome let's take a look in this inside of the car right huh

(Start: 00:10:13)
who remembers that I used to have one of those in the RX7 it was yeah it still is cool okay so stupid radio I got an apexy power FC old school I wanted to do this car era specific or period correct if you want to call it that but things change so I've decided I wanted an apexy with a hand controller it's sitting on apexy holder so it's proper legit it looks really cool that is a Grady perfect spec 2 or spec B gritty Perfect Two spec B that's the one really good boost control electronic boost controller for its Tom there's obviously a lot more advanced units uh do you have more advanced units than the cupboard but I wanted something like this because this was like a 2000s top spec unit there was an older one in here but it was giving me a little bit of issues with regards to wastegate lag and all that stuff so I opted to move for this it's not exactly period specific to this vehicle but it works and it works really

(Start: 00:11:14)
well this is very dirty I just noticed but apexy turbo timer there's a lot of apexy stuff in this car just by the boat so apexy holder apexy hand controller uh Grady boost controller apexy turbo timer Blitz 16 mil boost gauge it's a manual boost gauge so it's super responsive and then you guys know what that is that's an innovate that's like new so all the stuff here is like from 90s 2000s that's new innovate lc2 if your ratio guide all wired up this costs self-tune by myself I basically had the engine rebuilt rebuilt by Ashley in Durban neurons company called Scooby Works does an amazing job really good job however my first build it was a little bit of a rush um I decided to go for an oem plus build and it was smoking I was smoking a lot so there was an issue with the Pistons the Rings weren't seating properly I think it was on two Pistons

(Start: 00:12:15)
um they just weren't seating and I did a full running it took me a little while to do the running but the once the running was completed it was just bellowing out about white smoke and the white smoke was only coming out when the car is on Boost so I'd hit boost and the white smoke would come out so I thought immediately turbo so what did I do back to the cupboard I thought it was this turbo this is a TD 520g it's yeah one of those Chinese servers cheaply made it's probably good for one bar anything over it might break it's got vertical play on it which is not good there's horizontal player not much but it's a lot of vehicle play not good at all I thought it was this so I reached out to a fellow YouTuber he sold me his vf35 vf-35 didn't have any of the pipe work oil and all that sort of stuff so I ended up buying this really cooked look at that I might rebuild it's one of these days but it's a vf29 and these came off the V6 uh STI type ra and a

(Start: 00:13:16)
couple other cars GCA it's obviously vf29 pull all the stuff off threw it on the vf35 it's on the car the car's still smoking I tried loads of stuff like tell me about it loads and loads of Pistons I asked if you could help gladly no problem you stripped the engine again after he had rebuilt it and all that jazz let's pop this open all right let me show you guys why the dash is like hanging I quickly just pushed it back just for this video um I am actually busy doing some wiring of diodes and whatnot now what are the diodes for not for those Pampers nappies yes yes this thing's gonna blow my engine be our power Builder this thing does ignition cut and it goes it makes loud bangs pops I'm not gonna abuse it I'm gonna throw it on and I'll use it like once every like six months I don't know but I'm busy doing that that's why the dash is playing back and forth between topics engine rebuild second rebuild happened and I thought you know and let's do things properly so

(Start: 00:14:17)
now it's got Str rods and a whole bunch of other stuff and decent set of Pistons but it looks tuck and it looks damn stock mainly because I was supposed to move to Portugal Portugal the crazy laws where you can't really modify a car unless you homologate apart and you got to depart home allegation with like the DMV it's very confusing I have no idea how it works uh Fabio one of my friends in Portugal you know it's all about he's been doing it for his s13s and he was going to help me modify this car once it gets there but I wanted it stock or stock looking so when it gets there they're like okay it looks good it looks safe roadworthy that sort of stuff let's register it anyway I don't know maybe the Portugal so now here full boss to the wall again it's got an STL strut brace going across it's got 10 uh I think they're super streets decent coilovers uh WRX intercooler from

(Start: 00:15:17)
a later model things like from an O2 to o5 WRX it had a gfb uh I forgot which gfp one it was uh but it's the one that you could turn and all that stuff and blah blah blah had that red one what actually wasn't working so well it was sticky I'll end up fixing it but then I don't want it anymore so I'll end up throwing an oem on um this is I've actually got two OEM ones I've got the gc8 one but then this is a different setup so I'll end up running the hose the gc8 one connects over here on the side what's supposed to be on this car but this one I decided to run the hose from a later model down to the watch McCord intake side and it's like stock spec for like an O2 to o5 it's got stock air box there's a Conan there we go folds on it so I just breathes a little bit better I'm probably gonna change that I might

(Start: 00:16:17)
do like a parent setup or something I'm not sure yet um I have split fire coil pack and leads coming soon uh there's somewhere in the ocean I sent it slow mail via Japan to sa and it's stuck somewhere uh radiator has been sorted it's a Silverton radius radiator I wish it was a machine motor or something so it's a locally done thing it's just an oem one that's top tanks have been replaced and that's pretty much it I've got the wrong battery size it's in there it's got a 636 for some only reason I'm a cheap house I'm waiting for it completely died and I'll put the 639 that's supposed to be in the car that is pretty much it it's got a 76mm down pop it's got the vf35 has got a pro drive y-pipe on it and nothing else that I can really think of it had water mess in the car I forget to make uh it's in the cupboard yeah spending more time on the cupboard than anything else it is Devil's own that one

(Start: 00:17:19)
it had a full Devil's own kit um yeah whole sprayer thing you use wired virus switch the switch is still there on my Dash that one and it was a long thick cable all the way to the boot and everything was mounted on some rusty bracket look a lot of the that was done in this car wasn't pretty so that my friends in a nutshell is my gc8 Impreza I think I've covered everything on the car um it's a good looking car for its year it's it's still a decent car I don't know how much power making the bottom Dyno or but Dyno says 220 kilowatts plus minus I'm boosting 1.1 bar broken in the engine I've self-tuned it it's not mocking there's no debt no audible debt um I made myself a set of dead cans I learned how to tune um very basic stuff

(Start: 00:18:21)
um toming fuel injector timing lag that sort of stuff the real Basics but there's a lot of stuff that's out there like especially with the open source ecu's and all that stuff um that I don't know about but I learned from the apexy power SC and I can get around it and I did my thing and it's running it's working I literally I drove you a thousand and thirty K's I put pressure on the card was weighted heavily weighted I probably had about 600 kilos of crap inside the car and I was boosting some of the wear and I'll take it out on weekends it's very spirited drives and the car's been holding up and I'm happy I do want to boost it a bit higher I can probably go to about 1.3 1.4 comfortably um obviously with better fuel in it comfortably as in within my knowledge of tuning and safety and trusting myself and all that stuff also

(Start: 00:19:22)
I don't want to take a chance I'm not a professional this is the first time I'm really really tuning cars um you want to call them a guinea pig I don't know maybe it's my guinea pig but anyway guys thank you so much for watching that's my gc8 leave a comment let me know what you think about the car uh what should I do to the car I've got a couple plans there's like stuff like I mentioned um the coil pack I do want to change my intake my intercooler I want to go for a bigger one maybe a process with or STI it's cooler exhaust system is hundreds I don't want to touch that um I don't know what else might be a couple other things but we are getting that project cost so the focus the big focus is going to be on that project car and you guys don't know what it is yet you need to guess some of you guys guess some of you didn't take a guess uh it's on a truck as of today as of the time of filming us they said it'll be here within 10 working days my mate just sent his one it was Durbin joburg and I've got there in five working days or six working days I'm hoping it's the same we

(Start: 00:20:23)
can pick it up next week bring it home pocket right next to this thing and just get started I want to strip that thing down to bare metal thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it we'll see you on the next one peace

Title: WE FINALLY MOVED AND BOUGHT 2 MORE CARS!

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome back to the channel it's been a long long long long six months since I picked up the camera like really I really wanted to pick up the camera but I just couldn't there's been so much going on we've moved we've finally moved it's been like this long anticipated thing we just had so much drama since that unrest you know that fire the riots and all that they bring down warehouses it was it was hectic it was hectic for a lot of families and business owners and all that and and we got throttle ended up selling up all my cars but you guys know the story if you've been following me for quite some time we sold up everything GTR rx7s MR2 I gave away the one scarline and uh anyway we moved so you guys know if you've been following that we started getting passports ready and all that stuff for the kids and and um well I didn't say where I was going to move but we were we're going to move to Portugal and literally everything was ready I

(Start: 00:01:00)
made I made a really good friend in Portugal I'm I'm upset that I'm not going because well we're not going to be close to him um so a quick shout out to Fabio he's been such a help to myself to my family in trying to get us to relocate there and then well we're not there um we decided to give to Africa another shot I'm still an ESA I have a lot of faith in this country I've lived here my entire life I am Portuguese but born here I'm South African you can't tell me to go back to Europe and all that jazz so because I'm from here I'm a South African at heart and I don't want to give this all up just because of one silly law incident big answer anyway we moved and uh let me try and make this as short as possible and then don't run away because I bought two cars one of them is a project car the other one is a Weekender a cooker I'll show

(Start: 00:02:02)
you guys in a sec but anyway a long story short um my wife and I figured gardenery gardenery sounds safe what should I do so I flew into PE a Haider car contacted multiple estate agents like a week prior all the way from jbay to Mossel Bay and I was going to stop in between George and knysna blah blah blah I still went to knysna and George but anyway I fell in love with Jay Bay like really really fell in love with it and we ended up buying a house in Jeffrey's Bay it's flipping awesome um so we bought a house with a lot of space I'm currently in the garage right now and there's my gc8 still have it um double garage I got space for cars outside let's level the Lexus the Lexus is outside and in the comic I'll show you guys unfortunately the project car is still in Durban voted on the 26th of December and then it had no starter motor battle to get a

(Start: 00:03:03)
starter motor like a really battle to get a starter motor and then eventually found one wrong one for the wrong type of engine similar car wrong top engine we've got a new one like two months later cars running costatic um so that's that's a plus and then licensing just happened and it's on my name registered on the road all that and then unfortunately we had a death in the family my uncle passed away and it's just put a little bit of a delay on things so my dad didn't have a chance to send the car onto the trucking company and all that stuff and he's been an absolute star and pitching the car for me looking after it getting it running with the starter motor like he's been an amazing help and uh anyway I got to see the car and I'll end up going see it I don't want to give any spoilers here because you guys need to see this like properly I didn't take my camera down because I went there for the funeral and I was just there for one day

(Start: 00:04:03)
but the car was there at my parents place and I got to Tinker a little bit um super stoked there anyway I'm in Jay Bay it's quiet there's like 15 000 people living here it's got good schools it's got very very low crime rate there's a lot of Pros it's got an amazing scenery people are amazing like a lot of the people here are just super friendly they go out of their way to help you my estate agent who sold me this house  they have gone over and above like I cannot say anymore how grateful I am I mean he even came to fetch my new weekend car from PE with me because I needed a drop down  thanks guys anyway we here I'm gonna go for driving the gc8 in a little bit actually kind of filmed that yesterday but yeah because you'll see the transition I shaved today yesterday um this is my garage let me show you

(Start: 00:05:04)
around quickly it's not fully fully set up yet but uh I'm getting there excuse the noise inverter is busy charging I got solar converter with the last four Pro battery lithium ion um yeah it's sort of a lifesaver because we get stage six here in Birmingham from stage four to up and then even stage six in Durban is a stage two here anyway uh I put up some modular shelving here so I can just put brackets and go higher and I've got cupboard space which I've never had before we actually just got crap inside here at the moment turbos boxes these boxes are full of gauges and 80 Imports cool stuff little pegboard with some hand tools some spare wheels for this car um picked up those spares and then workbench another cabinet

(Start: 00:06:07)
piling up shirt tennis shoes in the corner and then my gc8 you guys need to see this thing it's changed so much first of all it's had a full respray it's looking damn good second it's got a second engine rebuild first one long story I'll tell you in the walk around video it's got a lot of stuff done there's a lot of changes to cause a lot here than what it used to be these seats if you're wondering they're for the project Club they require us they could possibly be fake but the car needs some seeds that car is a box to say the least but it's a good thing because I actually bought it because I want to track I want to track an elder scribunting Raceway it's in PE is 67ks from me and uh I need the seats so anyway there's a seats I've got a little Shrum set up here because I do miss my JDM Cars at the end of the day and he's slow stuff in remembrance of my car I'll probably expand on that and make it a little bit bigger one weekend and I already broke the garage door

(Start: 00:07:09)
my dad helped me fix everything I kind of pulled that red string here because there was no electricity and was before I had my inverter I pulled the red string and the garage door just flung all the way to the end bang crashed the whole top broke off so my dad and I or mostly my dad landed up uh fixing anyway I'm in Jay Bay it's flipping awesome and we'll take you out for a quick drive show you what's what in JB it's a couple things that I love I didn't get enough time in the car and he had about an hour you had to get back I still got young kids um my boy is only two and a half so [Music] how crazy is this view in front of me this is why I moved to Germany okay one of the reasons real estate was

(Start: 00:08:10)
a lot cheaper but on a serious note like I was saying I we didn't land on moving to Portugal because of all the things going on and then uh we figured you know what we had our honeymoon like almost 10 years ago why don't we come look in the garden route I mean just look at that just look at that I mean other than the views geez okay I'm looking at my camera again but wow it like stretches all the way across I've seen this almost every day we come down here yeah it stabilize my mind and I've never been one of those for like all the view and the beaches I've probably been to the beach already more than I have my entire life in Durban I'll be honest the roads are not great okay I've found a couple JDM Cars here

(Start: 00:09:13)
I found a yellow Evo 7 outside someone's house but dude also owns a blue dark blueish 200 SX s13 [Music] oh coilovers Jesus that's fine but that stretch of runs pretty bad the rest of us open um I mean it's pretty if you had a few compared to Durban but anyway three JDM Cars there's a hooker really there's a whole car WRX in front of me I can see it's the WRX apocalypse oh what's the chances

(Start: 00:10:15)
Hawk WRX seen a 2012 STI I can't technically that is on JDM they're just Japanese sports cars that we had JDM would be a car that was only sold in the Japanese domestic Market how are you guys mom generalized a lot of people not you go you guys are clever subscribe to me I've been waiting six months for me to throw up content I think I'm back I'm back I'm back I've started learning cars for sale videos I've got a whole bunch of other crap going on with content but let's shoot back to the garage so nice having a double garage okay you guys ready here it is boom I love the Subaru man uh 2005 2.5 XT Subaru Forester XT that's it such a good

(Start: 00:11:16)
car such a capable car uh all-wheel drive it's actually it's the same draft trainers then preds uh and it's got the ej25 on it and all that goodness look at this one crappy little awesome uh it's an automatic okay other than that the car is so neat for the year for the mileage especially for the mileage I bought a harm Mala I might have to rebuild it at some stage it's not the head gaskets haven't gone yet I've done about five 600 K's already myself pushing it hard um it's everything's stock which is great and then we've got the space I mean you guys have seen everybody's seen in 2005 Forest XT yeah it's just a normal force but it's clean it's about 360 000 kilometers again it's got all the good space in the

(Start: 00:12:17)
world I've got the thingy Coast okay you see those little bit forwards you can tell I've been using this for the beach yeah we kind of opted for the automatic because my my wife is also going to drive this car a little bit oh that's a piece of dip so yeah we got an order but it's so stuck how clean is that for 360 000ks and honestly I swear if you had to put a piece of tape over the mileage you would not tell that it's got 360. you might say maybe like 130 120 000 cares oil is good oil's clean looks brand new it probably got changed recently um sorry I'm lying uh coolant was not fun coolant had no she couldn't find another car

(Start: 00:13:19)
I need to change I need to do a cool and change like in a week or two anyway we bought it for us it's got a pro drive exhaust on the back that's the only mod but that's like an oem Factory thing that you can buy and that's like probably with most rusters on the back it's just surface rusting at the end of the day so yeah that's uh that's the Weekender we kind of bought it for two reasons uh first of all the Lexus is still going so well um love that car had it for a couple of years already and uh it's got the Toyota engine at the end of the day and it's just gonna last a very very long time especially when you look after it and I've been looking after the car so the Lexus we're still daily this thing we needed space because now we're living in Jay Bay we can jump in the car and drive to places like George larsner hermanus in Cape Town you know problems with the Lexus and two kids trying to cram the prayer man and trying to cram no this is what we needed double-edged

(Start: 00:14:20)
sword it's got a tow bar on the back because I don't live in Durban anymore my parents still live in Durban I don't have the luxury of borrowing my dad's buckies if you're not from South Africa his trucks has pick up um yeah so I kind of had to sort myself out so now I can carry a trailer pull a car all that stuff um so happy I'm I'm really really psyched and like I said it's been driving so well I may have to rebuild it in the future contents is going to be coming soon uh projects car is going to be arriving in plus minus 15 working days from the time of this video which sucks but when it's here there's so much to do I want to strip her down to Bare Metal as close as possible to bare metal and then we're going to build it up from there around drop an engine in it does have an engine in it now but we're gonna do a swap there's so much stuff that needs to be done and I I cannot wait it's a massive amount of content with that and then the other thing is next video will be this car

(Start: 00:15:23)
I'll do a walk around in there a full walk around it's overdue you guys know nothing about it and what's in there and there's some really good in that car after that I'm going to be carrying on um with monthly JDM Cars for sale in South Africa and I might do a global series of that because I've found some really cool cars overseas uh yeah we will see anyway I'm waffling thank you so much for watching I'm glad to be back um glad you guys are back and drop a comment also um what do you think I'm getting what is my project call what's your guess tell me I'm interested to see what you guys think um what Clues should I give you it's Japanese it's blue that's all I'm telling you thank you so much for watching see you on the next one peace

Title: Subaru MY00 GC8 - The Golden Mile

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys i think i'm back i think eight months later i haven't picked up the camera i haven't done anything and i feel like it's kind of the right time for me mentally to start making videos again i'm still in south africa yes i'm still here um i'm back in my old shitty garage from seven years ago the house was officially sold it only just recently sold i handed over the keys like two weeks ago um yeah it just took forever so we're still in the country uh we're gonna let my daughter finish the school year here because we're already quite late in the year later finish and then we're outta here [Music] okay just a quick recap if you guys don't remember i bought this car in november 2021 somebody out here already was a subscriber on the channel i had seen

(Start: 00:01:01)
this car previously on the roads in my area and i was like i really miss having a gc8 i hadn't had a gc8 in like i don't know 20 2011 probably was or 2010 was the last time i had a gc8 and i've had a couple of these before and and i kind of just feel like i never did really did them any justice and i didn't really appreciate them back then i kept just turning cars and i really wish i had another one and then i saw this car for sale and i had pretty much just sold all of my jdm cars at the time so i figured i need someone to keep me busy so i bought this and damn it's been keeping me busy holy crap so uh we're just driving around now i'm warming up the car i'm taking on to the freeway or the highway if you're from america and uh i'm going to show you guys a little bit about the area that i'll stay in and i'm also kind of doing these videos now

(Start: 00:02:02)
i'm going to obviously get some seat time now driving the car but i'm also doing these videos now so i can kind of remember because i am going to leave we're going to leave in a couple months or whatever five months and i need to remember where i came from here i am et cetera i've been here for 38 years this is my life and it's sad to see it all go anyway this car has kept me down busy uh like i said we've got all these cool little interior toys it's very subtle stuff that i've been throwing at the car nobody really knows where i'm going yet i haven't actually mentioned the exact whereabouts of where i'm going but um [Music] what i have been worried about really is that it's a new country you know the laws might be different so i don't want to go crazy and do like i don't know all sorts of exterior modifications and crazy engine bay mods and like you know cool stuff and then

(Start: 00:03:04)
find out oh well it's illegal to do that or whatever so i'm trying to get the car as stock as possible i've even picked up stock wheels i picked up uh stock 16s that come for this car funny enough to actually belong to this car like mount mineblog um they were the original wheels from this coin here i've got the original 16s i've got the engine bay is pretty much stock there is a bigger turbo i had a 20g when i first bought the car it had vertical play on it i wasn't happy with that so i swapped it out and i've now got this vf-35 in the car vf35 came off a 2005 sti um 2005 and so africa was still a blob-eye so 2005 had the vf-35 2006 onward in south africa had and i think australia was the same uh was the hawker and there was a vf43 i didn't want that turbo honestly i was actually on the hunt for a vr 34 from like a 0203

(Start: 00:04:04)
couldn't get it and that's ball bearing that's why i wanted it what i do want to talk about [Music] is that this is the second engine rebuild since i got the car so when i first got the car it had it had this super lumpy idle and uh the mechanic at the time he he said okay look it's uh cylinder three i think it was if there was an issue and it was causing the olympia idol and all that stuff they're cool let's just rebuild the car so rebuilt the engine i had issues like pretty soon after the rebuild i had issues with uh excessive smoke i didn't even come into boost i would just tap the accelerator and have a lot of smoke coming out like white grayish like

(Start: 00:05:05)
more on the white side and it it turns out that this was one of the rings that they didn't seat properly and i was still doing my running and all that stuff and i was actually babying the car a little bit too much from what he said he said i should have driven it harder a lot harder and i should have not waited so long before driving so i would leave it for extended periods like i've done with all my other cars and the car just wasn't happy so the one ring didn't seat pulled everything else it was an oem build like literally everything oem anyway just dropped it apart and we've gone fully fortunate pistons rings rods are from uh str from ej207 uh str crack from ej207 there's there's a couple other bits and bobs i forget now and i haven't been in front of a camera for a very long time so i'm kind of like spitballing here i just decided today out of the blue pick up

(Start: 00:06:05)
the cameras let's do it put them on charges give them a call let's go for a drop i've been driving this thing like almost every second day at least sometimes i drive it every other day every day uh so it's going well it's super smooth as you guys can see it's almost up to temp i've been enjoying this car i've been getting a lot of seat time in the car i've driven this car probably more than i have any of my other cars combined in like a five year period so really really really enjoying this i've been able to spend a lot of time on it uh so i've been shooting myself i've been learning also tune healing knock all that stuff i've got all the toys that i'm doing everything with and things have been going really well with the tuning obviously the stock map on these they're not good at all sorry let me backtrack they are great for a stock sti of this era

(Start: 00:07:06)
now if you're going to throw this on a gca wrx like this the heads are incredibly different between the sti and this if if you want to go with the aggressive timing the advanced timing that's currently on the stock map you're gonna do yourself then you're gonna probably pop an engine or something so that was um i had to retire the timing quite substantially i did so and it's a lot happier i've i've made it quite rich and yeah i mean like i said i've got all the toys i've got my my am wide band and all that jazz and um actually i just put the gauge and i think i already said that uh but i've been running things loose connected to the apexe and just having fun because i'm not filming my editing i've had a lot more time to actually learn and how to do things properly and the car is getting there the other big thing that has happened and i'll see if i can grab a picture or

(Start: 00:08:07)
something maybe throw it up on the screen but the car is fully resprayed now when i got it it was it had flaky paint it had massive rust issues uh rust issues up here and uh across this i don't know what you call this thing i've got new beading that's been been put on new clips man i've gone like over and above and pretty stoked oh by the way the beach and the sea is literally right next to me on my left this is what they call the durban golden mile and it's it's really cool we we haven't been here in a while especially since covert and all that stuff so we do little drive bars and all that stuff through here but it was really pretty i mean if you just have to take a left like over here where where this guy is coming out of you can park here your family and yourself can enjoy this and walk around do bike riding and all that jazz but

(Start: 00:09:09)
very cool um we started to come into durban central the town i don't really go in there and this is something i really need uh like picking up the wheels that i've scrubbed for the car i had to go to norman central and then up other than that i've just very rarely come but yeah you can see the sea and all that so this has now gone from a car into travel my bad uh what was i saying respray the car's been fully resprayed it looks awesome i haven't had it cut and polished yet and it got re-sprayed about a month ago i'm getting there slowly there's been a lot of stuff going on at the moment that i'm just trying to sort out my immigration and things around the house and all that stuff kids keep getting sick there's been a lot of new stuff going around anyway we've calmed down a lot i went out for dinner the other day i haven't been out to a restaurant since 2020 so i was pretty chuffed with myself i think chuffed might be this african

(Start: 00:10:10)
way i'm pretty proud of myself getting out there okay let's head back and i'll tap the boost a little bit here and there i forgot to throw some fuel in yesterday so i can't go too crazy like i said this was properly impromptu but listen to the sound of this thing it's stuck it's stock airbox it's got that whistle it's got oh engine bay like i said is almost like i threw the stock dumbfell if you open the bonnet and you take a look it looks like this is a stock car okay if you already know what you're looking for you'll see it's not a td04 it's a vf35 but other than that it looks the part it looks neat i'm i'm really stuck with it when i get to wherever i'm going we can stop playing when i bought this car i think i mentioned it in november i said i want to get a car and like get it back to all my stock and then like as a base and

(Start: 00:11:11)
then i'll go crazy and i'll do my thing and that's what we'll do wow now i'm stuck behind this dude i'll crack the windows open a little bit okay that's pretty damn windy i just wanted you guys to hear that little whistle so now that i've i've pretty much completed this car uh almost sort of i mean like what's left i got to clean up the engine bay a little bit because it's got all all the water powder from when they were sanding down the car and getting it prepped for respray they didn't exactly clean the engine bag because yeah well with the hood scoopers it got dirty so insecure and then the vents uh on the side so got dirty there it's not dirty anywhere else i need to clean it up a little but it's not even a project and then the only other thing i need to do is throw that big apexi back box on the car and i'm gonna put a cat on unfortunately

(Start: 00:12:11)
and when the cat is on well the car is gonna need a little bit of power and all that stuff but i'm throwing the cat on for a good reason and the reason for the cat is that i don't know the emissions laws and that sort of stuff so i just want to be prepared you know [Music] technically we're supposed to have them here no one cares no one does anything about it we never have emissions checks and all that jazz so you kind of just do whatever you want let's say africa [Music] come on there's literally no cause [Music]

(Start: 00:13:13)
i'm trying to keep it on the five grand i haven't done my first oil change yet i'm like right there i need a a couple more kilometers and i'm going to do my oil change but it sounds really good i'm sort of footing at the moment like i said  the timing quite a bit uh what else do i do fueling it's pig rich it's not it's safe the car is safe it still feels okay i mean that's fourth gear i'm under the speed limit here fourth gear just under 3000 rpm it's still got enough torque there now it's one bar like it's not as quick as my gtr used to be by no means but we can still make this thing quick i've got a little bit of boost spark at the moment it's coming off the manual miscontroller it's not controlling the wastegate properly um i probably should change it out

(Start: 00:14:18)
let me turn this thing down one notch you can hear how good that thing sounds i'm hoping you guys can hear up in itself come on taxi move he's hogging the first lane we're both going under the speed limit nope he doesn't want to move those windows are so blacked out i can't even see what's in front oh we're going to take the next turn off i got some stuff today anyway at least you guys got to kind of see my face for a little bit uh hear my annoying voice while i'm driving around

(Start: 00:15:19)
got to hear the subaru you guys got to hear exactly what's getting done okay let's uh slow down a little bit here and we're going to take it out just under foreground are you turning why are you turning [Music] i'm stoked it feels good and i know there's so much room to play my injectors duty cycles like 78 81 i've got a little bit of room to play now stock injectors i do need bigger ones let me tap it up here a little bit i do have a little bit of a boost spark turn

(Start: 00:16:20)
it down one notch it should have sorted out let's go that's under 5k rpm okay so that's the end of the video switch this bad boy off that's my gc8 um i'm kind of glad to be doing this again okay i'm kind of glad to be doing this again i'll be honest this is weird to say kind of missed you guys i owe a lot of people replies on my previous video sorry for not replying anyway let me know what you guys want to see content wise i'll try make a plan i'll try it out i'll just realize i've got bed head cool thanks so much for watching see you in the next one peace

Title: I GAVE A SUBSCRIBER MY NISSAN SKYLINE R33.

(Start: 00:00:00)
so as you can tell by the title of this video I'm going to be giving away Madison Skyline r33 so before we get into that I got to kind of tell you the backstory so November 2021 I had someone who told me they're very interested in the car they want to come and see it he flew down he took a look at the car um he then phoned me and said I'm not taking the car no problem um I had like five six other people lined up um and then there was a guy nearby uh Phoenix sawed a couple of kilometers away from me and he said you take the car you'll take the car the following day um cool no problem I'll send you my address later uh cash whatever he said cash the half an hour later the guy that phoned me to say he's not going to take the car the guy who flew in to come and look at the car said oh you know what I'm going to take the car I'm like okay cool uh but this other guy I've not told him he says you'll pay now so he sent me a small deposit and uh that was in November I've been calling him I've been texting him I've called him so many times it's

(Start: 00:01:02)
always next week I'll come next and then like it was there's a truck coming today to pick it up get ready I was here ready I prepped everything I flipping moved the engine I I got everything ready I moved the car out of the way didn't come send multiple texts and just ignores me I'm being completely ghosted so I'm like completely over it um I've decided the coolest thing for me to do just give this car away and that's what I've done so two weeks ago I thought about who could be the best possible person that I could give this car to and it turns out it's one of you guys it's a subscriber it's someone who reached out to me um I don't know during the course of when I started selling my cars and now reached out to me a few times to see how I'm doing and I appreciate that because I didn't get a lot of I mean I got a lot of people carrying and I still owe like

(Start: 00:02:04)
50 comments on my last video and I've read all of them and I'm really thankful for all that stuff but um I had I went through a little bit of depression and I'll probably do a mental health issues I don't know I had to sell my babies I sold seven oh my cause and it was gut wrenching to do to do that but anyway I'm still here at the house we only sold the house we thought we sold the house in February but then the guys pulled out duck a week or so in but now we are we've sold it officially so in the next two weeks or so it should be handed over it's been the sale happened about two months ago so it's getting lodged right now anyway so I particularly chose this person because he's a really good guy he's been following my channel since 2015 2016 which is crazy from the beginning he was super young at the time I think he was like 1560 when he started following me I think he's 23 now um lives in Johannesburg about 600

(Start: 00:03:04)
kilometers away I phoned him up and you guys need to see this reaction I trolled him a little bit I pretend that I was actually making a video for something else I want to ask you some random questions I'm not going to show you that whole video because it'll bore you but here's a look at Snippets and uh his reaction his reaction was amazing he's on the way he should be here he just landed in kzn in Durban where I live um he's coming to take the car now okay so we're gonna phone Matt now he has no idea and I'm gonna try and play this in such a way I don't want to troll him but I just want to kind of like gauge to see if he would actually accept the vehicle and then we'll tell him okay so Matt's not answering but I'm gonna send him a text I guess it's like not Tom now and uh Matt has just texted and he's actually

(Start: 00:04:07)

(Start: 00:05:09)
couple questions because you you've been around for a while I mean how long have you been following the channel for now it's like five years um I remember we were talking when you were importing that the uh okay so that's at least like 20 so 2016 was the first one that I brought in was the black one I think it wasn't really I remember there was a video on YouTube and JDM Carl um there's a couple of dealing cards and I saw your car just as you wrapped the blue and then I realized that you had an essay number place on it yeah okay I had to practice Channel oh that's quite crazy yeah that's 2016. yeah yeah that's crazy stuff dude I mean you're going into JDM Cars for like

(Start: 00:06:10)
quite a while now right yeah I think about it for a reason you've been following me for a while I mean we've never really met um well I mean we haven't met oh yeah I've just been the gone other side of the of your screen making videos we've spoken on the phone you one of the few people that have reached out to me like I've had I've had Conor I don't know if the right words to say like mental issues in the last couple of months but selling all of my JDM Cars took a hell of a toll on me and you've been one of the few people who've messaged like on a regular basis to see how I'm doing I mean not even like some of my mates that have like live nearby they've been checking out things have been tough um trying to get overseas and all that so and you've been one of the few that have actually like said How's it so yeah I I wanted to I wanted to do something for you I

(Start: 00:07:11)

(Start: 00:08:17)
Matt Stephanie how's it going man good good that's finally meet you yeah hello assistant yes welcome thank you thank you very much sorry about the noise oh they're re-spraying the sauce yeah for sure that's yours still like it's real man it's happening so it's been a little bit humid and Technology yeah we're sure no it did like well this is good morning look for the skyline oh I'm sorry sorry I'm all right yeah it needs uh needs a bit of TLC yeah yeah but but they are so bad so dude yeah you made it I mean did you

(Start: 00:09:17)
think this was real no no 100 knots not at all um I my initial thoughts was like okay you phoned me he's like do you have do you have space in your house like I was like okay maybe he's trying to maybe selling a car in joburg and he can't quite he needs space to park a car and I was like okay or whatever obviously um if you know me I'm always down to how about a friend no matter what so this was the least of my expectations this is at least what I expected I was just like blown away when I got the phone call you guys have probably heard it by now and it's just you heard my reaction it was just genuine like mind-blown uh you know I mean dude when when I find you okay so the whole thing was I kind of troll you trying to gauge like yes and then you told me some bad news your opal you ran a bearing yeah yeah yeah and then I was like holy [ __ ] okay you know maybe it doesn't kind of help you out I mean it's completely different it's a different thing I'm not going to help you with the airport no but it'll make

(Start: 00:10:20)
you feel better a little bit oh yeah I mean yeah guys on the day that uh Nelson called me my opal ran a bearing and shot and shot her right out of the block I was just driving on the highway and you know it was crazy luckily um I was in a good mindset at that point like if you if this happened to me like a yoga and I probably would have actually thrown the car over a cliff or something not that we have it was in trouble but you know but uh luckily through where I am now speaking of mental health where I am now and through what I've been through getting better uh every day like I realized it's like hey it's just a cop it's just metal so so we managed to get everything into the car pushed it to the corner it's been crazy we're about to get some noise here because I've got people respraying the Subaru so I'll probably be as quick as possible managed to get the RB into the front seat area that it was ridiculous we brought it on I actually wish I filmed some of it they brought it in um on the what do you call it engine stand pushed it up here used a huge

(Start: 00:11:22)
jacket I've got kind of lifted it up and then we just jiggled wiggled and managed to drop it in and we didn't damage the thing but it kind of mixed the piece of plastic and then I was like we put wood down and all sorts of stuff took the sensor of the steering wheel so we didn't damage that and we like got it and it just first we had to take the door card off so it actually closes properly other than that it's hundreds we've fill the car up with all the parts all that stuff that belongs to the car who it was yeah we got a very happy camper here [Music] show me what I'm looking for

(Start: 00:02:15)
day uh [Music] is [Applause] i [Music] okay i think we're done boys

(Start: 00:03:16)
oh my goodness um it looks a lot better it actually looks kind of stuck i got a lot of grass and had some coming in the grass for me today and stuff's looking so much better um and it's been raining so this car needs a wash i believe it's not raining tomorrow so that probably happened off cam so i bore you guys let's take a look oh that looks so much better wow okay so if you guys were skipping through the video and you weren't paying attention well then basically i stripped the paint or for the intercooler strip the paint off the heat shield it's looking a lot more oem i'll move the little horn buzzer thing that was somewhere there it didn't look great remove the boost control song that was attached there so it's much neater now you can kind of see the pro drive logo on the intercooler wipe up it needs a new intercooler wipe

(Start: 00:04:16)
up that one is up to and you saw that one it's a really flimsy and soft material over here and then there's a piece of aluminium straight pop or whatever in the middle so that's crap i need to get a new one probably at the same time i don't know get an str intercooler slightly bigger more airflow and cool a little bit better more efficient and all that jazz this looks nice i like the setup i like the stock air box and all that stuff it's probably the one of the most stock oh no i'm lying now i was gonna say probably one of the most stock cars that i've i've had but it's not the mr2 and the black core xl could completely forgot about that i'll be honest i left these ones off um this one i know can come out because there's no fuse and whatever's on the car is still working this one i'm assuming that this one was for the whatever called uh the am water meth in the back if you guys saw there was a part that was running into the back of the institute i do want to take those out i just need a test and i didn't have time

(Start: 00:05:18)
i don't think i actually showed you guys oh and i want a d badge another day look at that this whole setup needs to clean up uh that was me i didn't put the carpets back on um brake light was out i sorted it out wiring issue that's all fixed um i needed to do it so i could pass cri and the car fast i had a damaged cv boot slightly torn they still passed me anyway everything's 100 it's got a devil's own this is basically like your aem it's a devil's own alcohol methanol or whatever injection system pretty cool except i'm not going to be using it on this car i will keep it aside i'll put it with all my parts joint and i can throw it onto another build just not this car i want this car to be i don't know mine does does this make sense what i want to do to the cloth is basically get it to stock sort of stock like i'm doing now make it like look normal

(Start: 00:06:18)
and then modify it the way i want to modify and i'm not going to modify it here extensively i'm going to do a lot of the modifications overseas when i take the car if you missed that video this car is going to come with me overseas that's why i'm leaving i mean that's why i've been selling my other jdm cars i need the money for the others so i can buy houses and house not houses house daily driver etc etc without having to ask the bank for a loan and all that stuff so i need that this house is up for sale and everything else that goes along with it that being said i'm taking this thing with me and i want to get it to like stock ish and then i'm going to modify it properly but for now you can watch me on this little journey and i'm going to start bringing some other content i've actually started filming jdm cost for sales africa so there is an episode that is due for you guys to watch um that being said i think i've said that already that is it for this video thank you so much for watching um i'm glad

(Start: 00:07:19)
this car is getting some love and attention there's a lot to do um like i said on your d-badge i need to fix up some of the stuff i mean look at that there's holes on the wing that needs to be sorted out there's there's quite a few random things and then obviously paint paint is an issue and we're gonna get the paint sorted out properly well then i need to be a little bit of a girly man and i need to figure out how to sew and when i do figure out how to say i need to sew the front driver's seat the there's like a a tear like roughly about this big plus minus and uh it's just rather annoying so i want to get that sorted out it's also cigarette burn in the back which i know how to fix i could do that quite easily uh probably won't make a video on that because it'll just be boring content i've got lots to do um but yeah we're on the move i'm glad i'm glad i got this thing i need to go and take you guys for a proper drive uh possibly pick up a different gopro or another gopro and take it for a real drive anyway thank you so much for watching i'll see you in the next one peace

Title: Driving my Subaru GC8 WRX for the first time
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFgK7W2fAqA

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to a brand new video we're going to be test driving my new gc8 2000 wrx i've got my little gopro setup here gopro hero 2 unfortunately but we're going to make dude what a god maybe i'll turn around you can see a little bit of face cam while we're driving i don't know i don't have a big holder for this camera this would have been ideal but anyway we answered the gopro hero too i'll probably use this for audio sounds very good [Music] here we go boys first official drive in the subaru it's uh it's indeed a jdm model uh someone was awesome on instagram yesterday um it's it's not a south african car it was brought in as a returning resident many many many years ago it's fully registered licensed and uh it's a 2000 spec so it's the the last of the gc8 models that ever came out and i'm just taking it around the block because i don't know the car

(Start: 00:01:01)
i'm trying to figure out the gearing i just drove like a little bit away from my house and uh gearbox feels good so far this horizontal play though on the on the shifter i had no idea about it's pretty annoying but i don't know i know how to fix it there's a knuckle that you need for the shifter that'll stop the play from being horizontal so basically in gear and it's moving and it's just it's like a knuckle with uh some bushes on either side and anyway that's uh that's a different story what we're doing now is we're just figuring out the car this is the first time i'm doing one of these uh face cams while i'm driving i usually point at the road i don't know what's better for you guys but this is what you're getting right now still warming up so i can't hit it just yet sounds fantastic car really does sound good oh are you kidding me

(Start: 00:02:04)
man i did not plan properly gopro just died i thought i charged it clearly not so i'm hitting about one just under one bar boost it feels it feels okay i mean that was just the first gimbal let's uh let's see if we can get the car turn around so what i can feel i'm chilling at about 3000 rpm here the first ones to come in at about four plus miners

(Start: 00:03:19)
[Music] so [Music] little bit of power steering wide let's dial it up just under the boost then give it one second not bad not bad okay it's definitely not the powerhouse that much etr is that's a completely different animal but this is i would guesstimate right now about 180 kilowatts at an absolute maximum i love how the suspension reacts just the same as my 32 gtr a little bit clunky when it gets warmed up and it it feels almost identical the ride feels almost identical this has got hks um

(Start: 00:04:19)
coilovers with 10 top hats on it i've got 10 super streets in my gtr much of the muchness they're all they're both old japanese coilovers so far i'm impressed um i'm obviously hindered a with with the camera but it feels good doing the pulls i'm sitting now at about 1500 rpm flat down right now there's no avcs yep i would say okay i gotta i'm gonna raise that slightly higher i would say probably 185 to 190 kilowatts and the thing is the car is it's so much lighter than it's its counterparts like the bug eye and the blob eye and all that so you really do feel the boost come in a little bit harder and plus it's got a tdo5 16g so that

(Start: 00:05:22)
service might be bigger than your average vf-35 ef-22 and all that jazz i really did anyway you guys are going to enjoy this um so so far my thoughts on [Music] on the card actually well kind of beat my expectations to be honest um [Music] i used to own these cars this is my fourth gc8 i own a very long time ago i started buying subaru's 2000 six and uh it would have been before then 2004. [Music] and i mean i was young i was stupid i had no mechanical sympathy whatsoever and i kind of wrecked everything that i touched back in the day and the subarus are no exception

(Start: 00:06:22)
so on the gc8 models in particular i went through i think two engines and then three diffs and four gearboxes or four gearboxes and three diffs not a great example of being a subaru owner especially with no mechanical sympathy like i said i was young i was in my 20s and all i wanted was the noise and all i wanted to do was just kind of show launch and and you know it's not all about that anymore you can say i've turned into a fine one a little bit more mature fine one maybe some off cheese maybe instead of fun one anyway it is what it is i've got the vehicle um it's moving it drives it's not the fastest but perhaps one day it'll be a little bit quicker than what it is now um till then i'm just going to be doing some maintenance and stuff on it so

(Start: 00:07:23)
um i'm i'm sorry that i can't really get out of second gear at the moment i also didn't really want to leave you know the residential area i'm on freeways because i don't know the card i don't know if something will break and so we'll probably do that another day at least you got to hear it sounds good it really does a quick one so on the engine bay try to figure out what's hit figure out what's what and then [Music] i'll see you guys i don't remember if i ever showed you guys in the previous video but how neat the interior is it's actually so surprising i mean the ones that i own them over 10 years ago and and the interiors were definitely not as neat as these i did have one that i stripped out the entire dash now retro fitted was it retrofit of the right word i fitted a 2006 hawker sti complete dash steering wheel everything

(Start: 00:08:23)
moved into the gc8 i had to do a little bit of trimming on the sides with the dash to actually fit because that the the hawkeye is slightly wider but i managed to do it but anyway i'd never do that again that was pretty stupid you just got to appreciate the old things and this this is one of the things you've got to appreciate um i did talk about the interior but yeah i don't know if i'm gonna do that i'm gonna do that whole uh what you call it period correct boost control and all that jazz roof lining still okay a little bit dirty um but yeah it looks good the seats are in fantastic condition anyway i kind of feel bad about not uh charging the gopro and all that stuff and hopefully the video turns out just okay i'll be honest it was pretty difficult holding the camera and trying to focus on talking and all that stuff and then changing gears and i could probably do that in an automatic car so you know props to those guys like adam lz and tommy effect because they just hold the camera and go for it and they drive and they shift and they race and they like how the hell do you do that

(Start: 00:09:24)
properly and concentrate okay look i was doing it on tiny residential roads but yeah anyway um that being said the car does drive well uh power steering is very whiny so i'm probably gonna change up the pump pretty soon and there's a lot of cosmetic stuff so um i'm gonna focus on neatening up the car in the next few days um there's little issues i'm assuming there was another lip here and these holes were drilled and it was drilled in really badly these holes were drilled in and you know i suppose when the lip is here you don't notice these holes but still i want to fill them up i want to fix that this little gouge there i want to pull off these str stickers pink badge cool i used to rock that back in the day but it's going to go back to the standard stickers

(Start: 00:10:27)
at the back beating flew off apparently on the freeway or something and i hit a couple cars that the beating's with me i just need to see if i can maybe get it but if not buy a new beating that badge i'm pretty sure is original i'm 90 sure the badge is original it looks original looks like it came with maybe a blob or a hawker um but i want it off it's not an str the wing can stay i mean i i like the big eggnog obnoxious wing hk's power sticker come off number plates i know you guys see ours car and the next day or two it'll definitely pass to fix the brake light that was an issue and i don't see any other issues that'll stop it from from actually passing um yeah and then a little bit later i need to figure out what you see is in the car is it a stock ecu maybe i've got a

(Start: 00:11:28)
surprise maybe there's a power fc inside who knows car doesn't need a respray look at that anyway that's it for the video um i'm happy i'm happy i got the car i'm happy i'm back in the bandwagon with the whole filming thing and uh glad that you guys are commenting and appreciate and uh appreciate the support from the last video i really do so first of all from me um i need to shave first of all secondly thank you so much for all the support and i'll see you all next one peace

Title: THE TRUTH: WHY I SOLD MY JDM CARS
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVA6i0XpWA4

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel been a little while since i picked up the camera my fault been dealing with a couple issues um before we dive into it i think the title of this video is going to be like the truth or something because i am going to tell you the truth and what's going on but before you click off and skip through the video i bought a new car i bought a jdm car i bought another one um but now you need to hear why i bought it hopefully you can see me i can there's enough light because we're currently load shaded at the moment if you're not from south africa that means rolling blackouts we get them twice a day for the last week or two which kind of sucks that means you can't do anything inside unless you've got a laptop or a generator or ups power battery banks all that stuff anyway um i wanted to chat to you guys a little bit about my mental health where i came from and what i've been dealing with a little bit and i'm going to be totally honest with you what's been going on and why i've been selling all my jdm cars off so

(Start: 00:01:00)
first of all in the end of june beginning of july something around there we had that massive unrest in south africa where people were looting and burning down shops and people are dying and it was crazy it was absolutely ridiculous and we decided at that point that it's not safe to be in south africa for our children and no longer safe unless we had to move to somewhere like cape town particularly where we live in durban it's not safe and we decided that it's now time to emigrate and leave the country so that's the honest truth i didn't want to tell anybody i didn't want to tell you guys i didn't want to put it on social media because i didn't want my current place of employment to know at the time they are now aware of it and uh i unfortunately am going to be leaving south africa and next year so 2022 we're looking at probably we're trying to go as soon as possible so um i don't know the exact dates we're just waiting on a couple things and

(Start: 00:02:02)
yeah that's that's the main reason so houses uh getting sold the cars are getting sold i'm still going to sell the gtr behind me the r33 needs to go uh gtr obviously it's it's an expensive car um so it's going to take a little bit longer r33 it's got a lot of issues so that's also going to take a little bit longer but the price is good on that and i've been dropping the price every now and again so i did buy another car and i'll get into the reason why i bought another car for now and mental health and all that stuff so after the unrest uh things were crazy and unsettled very much unsettled especially here at home because a week or two after things had settled down and like these little militias and in our towns and areas disbanded and roadblocks got taken away um we started getting some petty crime and you know the average theft that happens um so we had an attempt to break in

(Start: 00:03:05)
about two weeks plus minus after the unrest and that kind of just cemented everything because it was like oh you know we got a lot here and we've really we've really made this our home i mean it's always been home i was born here i've been here for 37 years and i never wanted to leave we never once thought about leaving we never prepared to leave and that's also why we've taken quite a while to actually go yeah so i'm not going to say where are we going just yet it's going to be a surprise it's going to be super awesome and um anyway we had an attempt to break in uh fortunately for me my dogs were around um we've we've got all the security the cameras and all that stuff they didn't catch the guys they started fence hopping um our security company started chasing them uh then about a month later the same three guys came back so it's definitely intend to get in and didn't get caught again then about three weeks ago they came back again and it's not just us they're hitting houses across the road and down the road and next to us and

(Start: 00:04:09)
it's really horrible so yeah we know that we need to leave because of all these issues that's that now in between all of this i've been rather unhappy a little bit depressed here and there i try to compensate my happiness with computer gaming and i mean i've always loved computer gaming i used to play professionally back in the day um world cyber games electronic sports world cup rage uh all that stuff like from 2002 to 2007 i retired i had sponsorships going it was crazy i was like like i really played pro i had plantar plantronics behind us dfr land party motherboard company erectron sponsored us um played counter strike 1.6 back in the day and now i figured oh let me start streaming and going pro and i just wasn't happy doing it so the honest truth so i went to a little bit of depression and unhappiness um with everything and i kind of just started drifting into the personal life with family with kids and

(Start: 00:05:11)
and i've really been bleak about everything so because you know what's the point of working on the r33 if i know i'm not going to keep it forever and i'm not going to put my whole heart into it what's the point of owning the r32 but i'm going to keep it forever well i mean not owning it like driving it or doing whatever i need to do on it so it's sad so i had a bright idea and i spoke to my wife about it so we're only leaving like um first quarter second quarter 2022. why don't i buy another car so i've decided i'm selling these that's like gone i want to start fresh i don't want to take these across buy another car that i can work on and take with me and that's exactly what i've done so this should be the fix for my breakdown it already already is i feel a lot happier but before i show you the car this is how crazy it is uh looking at it

(Start: 00:06:12)
right now this is actually the most time i've spent now the car arrived yesterday morning everything went fine in the morning and then my daughter started feeling sick around mid-morning lunch time and like abdominal pains and blah blah anyway it turns out she had a spider bite and it affected everything else she was vomiting and i rushed her to the hospital and uh long story short i'm not going to talk about the hospital stuff but we only got back home late last night and she's she's okay now and uh i haven't touched the car all i did was put a sanitizer defogger thing inside the car and i turned the car around and just to make space in my driveway and looking at it right now this is the most time spent while filming this video so without theraju welcome to my forever car that i will be taking with me overseas to work on

(Start: 00:07:17)
[Music] right let me start this thing up for you guys it's officially my second start ever so [Music] [Music] [Music] runs pretty smoothly [Music] i mean there's a couple niggles that i got to sort out but uh for the most part it's actually really decent

(Start: 00:08:18)
i wonder if the air conditioning works that's something i never tried out in the car a little bit of surface rust i gotta sort out there some pulled water over there so that is it boys this is my 2000 gc8 super impressive wrx in royal silver it's actually a beautiful color i need to get it resprayed i don't yeah i don't know if i'll do the the black bonnet the black roof uh the roof's got a couple issues which i did some uh rust treatment on it it was just left

(Start: 00:09:19)
for a very long time a little bit of rust over here there all these little spots so i've done some brew rust rust converter peeled back a little bit of the paint on that side and one of the others rust converter i've got to do another coat now get that sanded out and then redo the roof back is spread here too it's on str so i'm gonna pull that out i'm gonna pull for the hk's power sticker cool sticker must have come with coilovers let me fix that you know i'm going to run through a list off cam of all the issues on the car figure out exactly what's wrong with it and then um we'll start making some videos we'll take a test drive the next video will definitely be a test drive i'm not taking it out in the rain now uh plus i don't have time it's uh monday early morning i've got to start working the next like half an hour or so maybe after work if it stops raining or tomorrow take off for a spin uh but videos are gonna be coming it's gonna be subaru content and then i'm gonna try get back into my groove and start doing those cars for south africa videos a

(Start: 00:10:20)
little bit more frequently and all that stuff i know you guys missed that content anyway thank you so much for watching i'll see you on the next one peace

Title: Test Driving My R32 GT-R, NEW JDM TOYS and MORE!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCQMtwnVkp0

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to a long overdue video it's been plus minus like four weeks since i picked up the camera and actually done anything my apologies for that so before we get cracking on the video um first of all i just want to say thank you to those who have reached out on instagram tik tok youtube and just messages of care asking if i'm okay how's the family because obviously i've been selling off my jdm cars and well i don't know what the future holds for me but gtr's gonna be up for celsius there's been a couple issues that i've been sorting out a few issues that are addressed from that for sale video that i figured it's not fair on the i know much like the boost buff so that's sorted out we'll get into that in a moment but there's also been some comments from random people like people that probably not subscribed saying you're nothing without your jdm cars let me tell you something i don't need jdm cars to make me the jdm master [Music]

(Start: 00:01:02)
that being said there's going to be a little bit of driving gtr driving yes i drove the car for the first time in like 18 19 months there were some issues we're gonna dive right into it so first of all i had the car up on stands for some time what i did was i pulled the the front bumper off and then i sorted out these boost pumps i was i was complaining in the for sale video that the boost pipes were crimping on the driver's side but i did the makeshift setup well i've sorted it out now so i figured out where it was crimping i've got a piece of hard pop in there and the car is boosting now it's boosting like strong it's boosting just over one bar which is fantastic uh back to 300 plus kilowatt range and uh it's an animal what can i say however there's an issue the issue is one of these i told you so issues from or particularly one person tangle01 in australia he said do not go for electric fans on the r32 gtr uh or any rb motor go for the clutch fan the viscous fan the problem is the clutch pad broke we all know what

(Start: 00:02:03)
happened it kind of ate into my radiator there that one so that one's like all mangled and broken and then here's the radiator that kind of like ate so yeah i'm not going back for stock i'm not going to put the stock radiator on the viscous fan i'll just there's nothing in the country that i can replace it with and me ordering from overseas is just ridiculous so what i've done i've spoken to the guys at universal cooling hot for cold up in johannesburg or pretoria actually then centurion i'm lying and uh they've been kind enough to help me uh work out exactly what i need and we're gonna replace this crappy universal fan that i've got on the r32 gtr yeah okay so i've got this thing on the car right now which is a universal one it cost me like 300 yen which is nothing what's that it's like uh 25 australian dollars absolutely nothing cfm rating is

(Start: 00:03:05)
super low i've now ordered a big 14 inch spall fan and then an eight inch spall fan as well spool spell i don't know how you said uh the eight inch eight inches to go over here so you see this area here i've got a gap over here i've got these knuckles for the power steering they're kind of in the way but this is flexible rubber so i can pull that back a-tips can fit over there comfortably that is the plan i'm going to get this in asap but in the meantime you can take a look at some driving from the r32 gtr first time i drove it on the road so just drove it around the area but five kilometer radius just for a little while unfortunately my normal uh action cam thing that i use it's an easy vis s5 plus it wasn't expensive i mean it wasn't cheap rather um conked out so i had to move over to my gopro hero 2 which i haven't used in years and quality is not the greatest but watch it the audio is good and then when you're back i'm going to

(Start: 00:04:06)
show you guys some new toys that i received from japan and we're going to open up these spoiler fans spoil spell okay [Music] first real drive in like a year pretty sure everything will be fun [Music] it's my first drive on this uh what i call a work spell

(Start: 00:05:06)
quick flip up steering wheel thingy first impressions uh i don't know i mean it's a little bit close i can't really push my seat too far back otherwise i'm not gonna be able to reach the pedals i'm only one meter seven eight my only gripe with it right now is that this just feels a bit far if you guys can see that to reach that and i know that's why some people have those extenders that come up like over there with my fingers

(Start: 00:06:18)
there check it out this is so cool this is some of the stuff that i received from japan just running through it quickly gritty temperature goes this is like a universal one that you can use uh for exhaust you can use it for oil you can use water this one is really cool it needs a cleanup though this is a mechanical apexi boost gauge very nice on a blitz holder so that's really cool mechanical just make things a lot easier really old-school apexi holder these holders are fantastic for stuff like apexy power fc hand controller etc i have got a fuel cut defender with the

(Start: 00:07:19)
original plastic over it that fuel cap defender came off a 200 sx or 180 sx in japan with a cr18 det thus boost codes it's electronic it's a griddy it comes with the control unit anything that's missing i don't have the sensor for it what i generally do is when i buy these auctions i buy stuff that's missing components because i get it at like 10 of the value because it's considered the junk item doesn't have the thing so all i need now is the sensor put it together i've got a complete unit that i've paid next to nothing for this is a sandwich plate for a 206 or 180 sx it's a gritty sandwich plate now sandra's plate is pretty simple you take the sensor from here and you bolt it into the sandwich plate and you get your readings out of it so you get your oil tempering your oil pressure then i picked up this 52 mil race tech gauge nothing special not even like a big name brand it was actually a bundle deal i won this together this is also race tech

(Start: 00:08:21)
and then it came with that guy so this is a race tech uh i think it's just a generic one what i actually wanted and why i found this together was this this is a lamko boost gauge mechanical lamko is a big brand that guys use on subarus or at least the factory uses all the subarus so i'll end up wanting this whole bunch together then now this is cool brand new brand new inverted commerce uh it's in the box never been used actually i don't need it open that's quite boring it's just a little unit inside here it's a gritty eliminator cut controller for 3s gte sw20 it might work on the silica basically this will stop the boost limit so once once you increase the boost it's going to pick up and it's gonna do the boost cup in the ecu and you can't really drive the car now this stuff is cool this is actually tiny it looks pretty big on the camera so if you're from south africa you'll know what this is this is for your host pop it will host pipe attachment you know how small this

(Start: 00:09:22)
is so you can see how i'm holding my hand look at the size okay now you can gauge how small this look i don't have any coins in the garage to actually show you but if you're from south africa you'll know what that is this is a 43 mil blitz boost gauge that's a 52 mil that's your normal big boy if you run your car your 60 mil and then i picked up this bad big boy 80 millimeter blitz boost gauge i would probably never run that they're so obnoxious but it's so cool at the same time and seeing mini me and big boy that's cool i'm only ever used to these gauges and then you're probably wondering like why the hell am i collecting gauges and collecting all this sort of stuff when i've been selling off my cars and yes this r32 is going to be able for sale shortly and so is the 33 i'm just i'm going to work on the car a little bit enjoy a little bit more why am i still collecting parts i'm selling all of them well it's not over the journey's not over i'm still going to collect cars whether it's here or somewhere else

(Start: 00:10:23)
you know i don't know but i'm liquidating assets right now because shit's been scary we actually just had a attempted break-in um first time in i've been i've owned the house for five years now and we've been living in here for about four and a bit four and a half years we've never had an issue with someone trying to come in and we had an attempt to break in four nights ago five nights ago first time ever not nice not cool anyway um that coupled with the riots and all the issues that we had and the shortage of food the shortage of animal food cat litter we didn't have cat litter for a while couldn't get it from shops locally until everything settled down sucked hard and and then now just on top of everything there was a dude that was caught in the middle of night early hours in the morning on our road taking photos of all the houses basically casing houses from the outside luckily he got caught but i mean what i

(Start: 00:11:25)
don't know how long am i going to keep him for probably keep them in for a week a day and not prosecute i don't know if they'll even prosecute anyway stuff is getting real and i always wanted a free standing house because i have the freedom to work on cars i can make noise i can beat hammers i can have party dogs outside um you know all that sort of stuff if i go into an estate like i used to be i can't come and go and do what i want cut angle ground in my garage so you know i'm we don't know what we're doing yet but i'll tell you something it's not the end for jdm cars i will get new i will get better maybe worse maybe we'll have more project guys i don't know have 10 project cars we'll see but these hottie dolls are getting crazy but do they work on the word but

(Start: 00:12:35)
anyway um i'll do stuff backwards you guys know this on the channel i picked up the engine behind me the rb20 with the intention to throw it into a vehicle i didn't have a vehicle at a time for it i had obviously the gtr rx-7 the mr2 but i didn't have something i could put it into like properly and then i picked up the skyline r33 the rolling shell i'll do things backwards so i'm buying all these parts also because i like collecting stuff but take a look at this here's some other stuff i've i've actually it's a little bit less the collection i'll end up swapping someone for an apexi uh in one exhaust there i've swapped them like i actually don't remember three gauges and something else um so some of my collection has come down a little bit some of you guys have seen this so maybe you haven't uh ignore the box i'm gonna toss the box i was gonna do like a little pretty thing where i could switch stuff on and off and like a display thing that's not happening anymore hks evc 5 gritty

a blood exhaust tip this is a huge mess right now because i was actually hunting for something the other day and i just kind of threw everything around i need clean up box and i don't know do whatever hps evc 3 or 4 forget which one with the solenoids all that jazz hks turbo timer hks sorry these are the fours hks evc4 right here i've got two of these units with solid lens everything's complete i've got a cross boost up boost controller plus uh fuel pressure rpm i don't know what it does actually but it's cool and everything's there all the way there i've got electronic toll collection system which is the same one that was in my silver fd with lady speaking fpt turbo timer really old hks turbo timer and then this etc boost controller also with solenoids with all that goodness so i collect like random stuff

(Start: 00:15:37)
then i've also got ortek uh what do you call those wheel cabs five zigging wheel caps cool stuff something picking up from japan and stuff i'm hoping to keep for a very long time i wouldn't want to sell it but anyway that's some of the stuff this is the new addition to the family and then we'll throw these into project cars and it's it's a pity um i'm selling this car as is because it's got quite a lot of stuff if you didn't watch that for sale video it's got a lot of cool stuff in this car if the new owner or whoever wants to buy it wants to negotiate a little bit and negotiate a little bit too much then i'm going to start stripping stuff off like that apexy 60 mil boost gauge is sitting on an original apex holder that apexy power fc hand shot is sitting on the original holder i've got a worx bell quick flip up i've got a granny turbo timer it's also the boost

to a time picks up boost and whole bunch of oyster hks evc 5 worth the digital display razor shifter godzilla they're chilling on the seat with the perimeter marker now we're going to make sure the guys at universal coolers sent through the right stuff oh okay so this is the first one this is the 8-inch this ends up actually being a davies craig version i thought i've got a smaller version but that's fine nonetheless davey's craig is pretty awesome oh okay i was getting a little bit worried because i i looked at it i picked it up like this and i was like okay this is not the same as the universal fan but it's not if you guys can see it's this ball over there spall over here va08

(Start: 00:17:40)
ap70ll 12 volt and i kind of forgot to mention the issue the issue was the universal fan that's on there just wasn't keeping the car cool enough so the car would get to 85 degrees within like i don't know probably seven to ten minutes of driving which not fantastic at all anyway i'm pretty confident this will sort out all the issues and then at least i can sell the car comfortably because i haven't actually bothered advertising the car so since i did a for sale video on here i haven't advertised the car because one i thought it wasn't last selling a gtr which is supposed to be a machine at premium rates that one can't boost because of the crimping pipe so that's sorted out to the cooling so i want to make sure i mean this stuff cost me 4 000 right now um 3 800 and something 381 8.75 not cheap but i got it i got it quickly that means i can put the card for sale quickly if i ordered something from overseas i would

(Start: 00:06:04)
parties this one i'm going to keep for a little bit longer and here's why so i'm not planning on fleeing the country or anything at least not just yet but we are preparing okay things aren't pretty here at the moment but they have calmed down but we need to be prepared and if we do need to leave i don't need all these things and i do want to rebuild in the future so i'll tell you that much but i'm going to be very bored without anything i feel that it is my duty to owe you guys to at least get this car to a better state than what it came in and what it is right now and also why i put it on hold is because i have stuff that's still arriving there's another side mirror that's supposed to be coming there's a windscreen that's coming i don't know whether i need to swap that out um there's quite a few things i actually don't even remember now there's stuff coming and it's gonna make the car better and then i'll get rid of it maybe we'll see so what sparked this whole thing

(Start: 00:07:04)
was my daughter i spoke to her i've always told her this is her car and i told her listen the other two they were getting sold and she started crying because she didn't want me to sell this one so i got sad about that but this also arrived yesterday it's a grill for this car specifically for this car it's for hr33 and uh obviously there's no bumper yet i wasn't a buyer bumper then it was crap started we'll probably still get a bumper uh stop piecing things together carry on finishing this stuff and then move on i'm still going to do this thing with the fascia or fascia i'll put it all on hold i started cutting it where is it someone sent me a comment and they said this is a cad drawing i was like huh dad he says no cardboard assisted drawing or yeah it was drawing cardboard assisted drawing cool so that's the story um i'm still gonna throw my gauges in there turbo timer boost controller that sort of stuff in here make it pretty fitted karen with the panel beading sanding all that stuff but i just need

(Start: 00:08:05)
to focus on selling all the cars and then moving on so that is the end of the story um i'm going to be changing my mind and just keeping this for a little while longer i know there's been a lot of interest like i was saying about 300 dms about 30 of them have been specifically for this car because i haven't posted the price for this car i posted everything else if i do sell this con when i do it's going to come with an rb20 det original dt not a n a version that has a turbo det fenders bonnet bumper all that stuff side mirrors complete interior i'm going to carry on and make this cool and then i'll maybe sell the car we'll see now that you guys know what's going on uh there's still a very sad video that i need to make and i'm likely going to film that tomorrow and that is going to be the for sale video on the l32 gtr and that's going to be a tough one that's my baby i bought them 2013. i chose it in japan i mean i chose other ones in japan too but that was my first

real jdm car i've had nine subaru's in the past and it was just like a thing i'll just drive to jailbreak i pick them up or drive to wherever there's one in durban go buy it and like everybody's got a subaru but then a gtr not everybody's got a gtr like that and then i made it my own by changing like everything and the car is cool so i'm going to be sad making that video and that will go up in the next few days and then the car is officially for sale thought i'd let you guys in please go support craig super coop thank you so much for watching i'll see you all next time peace

Title: My Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R Pre-Sale WALKAROUND
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a76UL8PSDvI

(Start: 00:00:00)
yesterday was probably one of the saddest days of my life i said goodbye to my big single turbo rx-753s and now i'm about to make the pre-sale walk-around video for my r32 gtr i never wanted to sell these cars i never wanted to leave the country i never once felt not safe in this country until the civil uprest that happened 800 meters long i thought the majority of it happened down the road um i need to sell everything liquidate make sure that my kids are safe in the future i'm mentioning this again because i keep getting asked in almost every single with every single vehicle that i've put up for sale that's why i'm mentioning it again now black rx7 is getting picked up in the next 20 minutes there's all the paperwork change of ownership logbook all that stuff things are just getting worse the cars are going like this and i haven't even advertised them

(Start: 00:01:01)
on like your gum trees olex's all that sort of stuff i did this the silver rx-7 for a day on there but yeah crazy anyway let's take a look at this there's a fake smile i don't want to sell the car it is what it is i'm going to try to be as honest as possible because i don't like to  anybody this is my r32 gtr i imported it in 2013 which means it's it's been registered for seven years it's been in the country for eight years that means that it is legal to sell in the republic of south africa as you can see there's a whole bunch of writing on the card this is plasti-dip that means it can be removed the car underneath is silver we'll get into the paintwork stuff in a sec it's not the cleanest it would need a respray it's it's i mean it's a 1993 it's an old vehicle there's some paint issues but we'll dive into in a sec so with regards to what's done the car's got 17 inch wheels 245 45 17 all around it's sitting on some gorgeous p1 racing wheels with regards to the brakes it's still got the stock calipers

(Start: 00:02:01)
on it it's using ebc green stuff pads the front dust or cross build and so are the rear discs they also cross drilled rear calipers or stock as well they've been painted yellow that came like that from japan and then on the underside of the car it still has high cast i don't think it works the high cast launcher stays on all the time not a big deal everybody hates hardcast anyway and throws lockout bars or removes the entire system mine just has light on i don't feel any difference the chlorides the foil steering works as far as i know or as far as i felt before there are some tane coilovers on the car all round they're fully adjustable you can do height you can do stiffness um they seem to be fine i've had no issues with them they're very stiff um the car doesn't move if you try and bounce it it's rock solid underneath there are some nismo bits i forget what exactly i do have some pictures i'll throw them up on the screen now there's some lisbo bits underneath so that is it on the suspension and wheel side let's take a quick look at

(Start: 00:03:02)
the interior before we dive into the rest of the car i haven't i'll be honest had a chance to vacuum or wash the car i literally just hit it with a hose pipe and i'm carrying off it's so damn busy with everything else um seats are stock this is what you call the cold weather package and by the way i have every single bit of documentation from this car back from when it was imported i know exactly what spec i have auction sheets i've got the works every single thing that you need much like the other cars that i've sold the cold weather package had these type of like blue-ish seats and it had a couple other little things that i completely forgot about now but it's all documented on the internet the gear knob on the car that's a razor gear knob over here we have an apex power fc and that is the hand controller for it so it's basically a controller for the ecu this car only has good parts of it that's an apexy boost cage

(Start: 00:04:03)
original apexy boosted 60 millimeter over here we have an hks ubc 5 boost controller with digital display this little panel has was made by myself that was actually the template that i used and it was a cardboard template that i wrapped so it's actually kind of sinking in a little bit i was supposed to cut up masonite and then do that and then i thought you know i don't have time for that and i'm busy filming other stuff from my youtube never got around to changing that so that should actually be changed so it doesn't sink in a little bit you can see it's sunken in slightly there just like cosmetic stuff over here i've got an original works bell quick left quick flip up steering wheel so the steering wheel hub is pretty cool so if you want to get out of the car if there's a fire or something and you've got to get out quick just pull in here boom jump out the car and that's it and it sits like that pretty cool though and then locked now

(Start: 00:05:04)
it doesn't come up this is an original momo race wheel came from japan like that there is a boost gauge over here the plan was to get an aem wide bound and throw it over and over there the boost gauge is just there as a placeholder that doesn't actually work it popped a little while ago that's why i've got that 16mm boost gauge on that side honestly speaking the wiring was all done by myself i would probably re-look at the wiring i'm not the greatest auto electrician around i'm not the greatest at anything to be honest take a look at the wiring it's done the way i thought was right i don't know stuff works what else everything else is pretty much neat on the interior there's no tears in the seats they're not creased okay there's a small little crease over here um i mean everything looks fantastic the door cards are neat everything is clean i mean these vacuum needs these are washed but the car is really really decent

(Start: 00:06:05)
these mats are old i'll tell you that much these are the original skyline mats you can see there's a tear on there underneath they're falling apart they're cracking but again these mats are what's 993 that's like 28 years ago it's old petals still have the original nissan covers that footrest over there is missing the cover it never came from japan and i've got a gritty turbo timer over there and then this over here is actually the fan switch i've got an electric fan on the car it's not that efficient there used to be a viscous fan it sounded horrible i changed the radiator and i put this electric fan on i kind of regret doing that it's about five degrees plus minus warmer with an aftermarket radiator so i would recommend whoever gets the car whoever buys it go back to the viscous fan let's take a look at the engine modifications and whatnot

(Start: 00:07:10)
you can see the silver shining through so the plastic dip is 20 16 2016 i had the plastic and it's it's held up really well it's actually pretty neat there's a video on my youtube channel called uh what does my plastic look like something like that just before we get to the engine i'll just notice this now there's a tear on here it's not that serious i actually didn't even know it had this issue so yeah there's a tea over there interior eyes i don't see any other issues i haven't noticed anything all the clips are intact like cubbyhole etc everything works everything's clean the leather is clean like i said the seats are clean the rear seats are in everything looks good electric windows work the aircon still works by the way the aircon is strong it's pretty much stronger than my lexus air conditioner

(Start: 00:08:10)
oh before we dive into the engine let's take a look at this and then you can really see there's a few little issues with regards to bodywork we'll dive into that after but there is a huge intercooler here and what inspire is this this is an original grady trust intercooler see over there it says trust the insecure goes all the way from the bottom here all over the top it's massive it's not a small insecure and it's thick as well oh engine bay is a little bit dusty um what have we got here we've got an aftermarket radiator that radiator is pretty thick it's pretty big and there's an electric fan that's underneath the shroud that i had to modify to actually get to work so it's cut over there and then the bottom still has most of the stuff intact but there's an electric fan inside here and it works but it's just it's not as efficient as the viscous so i would recommend go back to the viscous over here i've got my hk super power flow intakes it's

(Start: 00:09:11)
still running on maps the turbos i was told from japan they are the n1 turbos so i'm not sure i don't know if they're ceramic wheeled if they're in n1s i have been pretty careful with regards to boost i've never gone past 1.05 bar boost there was one issue i think there was a boost pipe that popped off and the cost shot up to 1.5 1.6 bar for like two seconds and that was it so being as honest as possible here um turbos are fine the car is fine have a listen to this clip the car sounds demonic at 1.05 making some decent power

(Start: 00:10:16)
so so the power that you just saw in that vid the butt dino my butt done it tells me roughly around 330 to 340 kilowatts it dynoed at 303 kilowatts back in 24 2015 whatever it is on the screen really good curve smooth power and that was at one bar without the boost controller without the down part and without a couple other small things so i've got full custom down pop it's 276 mil custom down parts going into 88 mil pipe all the way back to a kakimoto back box i'll show you the back box in a minute with regards to the intake system it's all completely stock except for this aluminium pipe over here decent look needs a polish radiator hoses are done isn't a gritty oil catch can i'm not too happy with it i would probably go back to stock i

(Start: 00:11:17)
actually might just change it back to stock myself and just include it in the sale of the car um but it puffs quite a bit out of here and it's not so pleasant i know you're supposed to put one of these things in and because of covert i just haven't gotten out to go and buy that sort of stuff um i might just plum it back to normal it seems to be a little bit healthier may notice the battery is no longer here it's been relocated to the boot so there's my battery terminal i would probably change the battery terminal something that looks better i mean it works but it's it's a star sound one is from auto style i don't know it's got zero gauge cable thick thick click cable let's run all the way to the back through the firewall through the wheel arch sorry wheel arch then firewall all the way through to the back of the car and that's working i've got no issues with it i've never had and then there's some wiring over here that i would have loved to have cleaned up but i never got around to doing it this is the wiring here with a bosch relay that's doing the switching for the

(Start: 00:12:17)
electric fan there's a switch in the interior but it runs through the relay and it switches the fan on and off so here's the air conditioning pump power steering everything is on the vehicle there's led lights in the front uh the controllers for them are at the bottom there's one and then the other one is tucked away somewhere the castle has these stock actuators you can kind of see it over there there we go now you can see it stock actuators but i've changed all the vacuum hoses because the vacuum hoses obviously become brittle over time those all change then they're all red silicon high quality vacuum hoses new t-pieces all that sort of stuff running obviously to the new solenoid the engine bay itself is average the paint is a little bit discolored funny enough this is my only vehicle that has discolored paint and it's the most expensive vehicle and the most modified the only one that has discolored paint in the engine base it's so weird

(Start: 00:13:20)
let's take a quick look at the exhaust so here it is this is a kaki motor back box it's quite a big boy i mean there's 88 mil pop that's running all the way back into this and it's stock supports 88 mil three and a half inch okay let's talk about paint and issues and i'm going to be showing a couple videos flashbacks and that sort of stuff because i'm not going to be pulling this plastic off i don't have time to pull it off it's just not going to happen but the the paint underneath is not fantastic in certain areas and i'll show you where exactly okay so first of all starting off with the bumper the bumper had some issues so this number plate is stuck on a double sided tape so just behind here it's still silver um there was some scrappage over here i i knocked this car like not knocked i literally just scraped it i think of this video if there is it's popping up on your

(Start: 00:14:20)
screen i tapped it into a wall in like 20 15-ish into a wall in my garage and it scraped and you can see underneath the plastidip there's a couple little scrape marks they don't need to be filled that would need to be sanded re-sprayed plasti-dippers torn over there there's a silver peeking right through that over there came all mangled and mist from japan i haven't tried to repair it i haven't done anything to it here i mean this car just sits in the back burner and i work my other projects the bumper was cut over there to fit the radiator it wasn't sorry the intercooler it wasn't cut and fitted too nicely and that was done from japan which was rather annoying to see something like that especially on an n1 bumper that being said in one bumper there's the two holes for it then with regards to the rest of the paint uh from what i remember the bonnet was clean the doors were clean mirrors were clean there wasn't any clear coat damage around here except for

(Start: 00:15:22)
this panel over here right here there was some weird discoloration i'm hoping i can get it in some old pictures or an old video but over here it's it felt like something underneath the clear coat and it was kind of like white maybe it was clear cut i don't remember it was a couple years ago there was an issue there the rest of the paint was all right over here until we get to the rear boot area so i fitted this nismo in one lip in the back um the fitment was terrible like really truly terrible it's i often don't show the rear of the car because of that um it with the heat and the sun it actually lifted up so now there's a gap over here and now you can see the glue that i used to hold it down which was like some sort of silicone glue by the way i'd just hose the card down um so there's a little bit of water everywhere here and there so this actually lifted up and it's no longer flush with the bodywork but anyway if you're gonna pull the plastic lip off you need

(Start: 00:16:22)
to take that off the boot however was in not great condition the wing was good the wing was fine the paintwork around here was okay but over here this area and over here weird there's an old video i was pulling off the nismo sorry the nissan badge in the back over here which i no longer have just by the way um weird issues over here with the paint like indents like cut-outs like it would need to be re-sprayed and full no rust damage and no issues like that this car has never had rust to my knowledge from japan and while it's been here the car has been fantastic i know i've seen stuff like kelvin mali in the states he's got massive massive rust damage this is not one of those cars this was a top really good spec back in the day picked up really early before the hype and before people started actually screwing everyone over for money that being said this entire boot lid would need to be

(Start: 00:17:23)
sorted out sander sprayed all that jazz um just underneath here it doesn't look so great either some weird paint discoloration and whatnot i wasn't impressed with that i ran away again but not stick a huge one over here to like kind of mask all the crap that was on the back of the car it's dirty there's a lot of dust in the back i feel bad not having the time to actually wash it but things are going a little bit crazy martin um paint issues on this side i think we're okay i don't really remember i know the door handle was an issue and still isn't so you can see here on the door handle a little bit wet sorry [Music] can you see that it's like all raised over here weird and then over there so the pasty dub has masked it a little bit but there were touch-ups over here i'm assuming the guy had long fingernails whoever owned the car in japan and when he was opening the door he kept scratching it and he he damaged the paint over here so that it came down to like almost primer over

(Start: 00:18:24)
here annoying plastic dip is hidden there i never fixed these issues before plastic dipping the car and i do feel bad about it that's pretty much it to my knowledge on the paint issues on you know cosmetic issues that the car has mechanically the engine was running fine i haven't driven the car since the month prior to the massive lockdown so there was an issue and it was documented on my youtube in a couple of videos and it was really annoying this car was an absolute animal beast the way i had set it up oh i forgot something there's a a pretty rare mine's strut base this is an original monster strat brace and an apexi what do you call it radiator cap a very annoying issue the intercooler parts on this side kept popping off it was the stock so that side's got hard parts this side for some reason still had the stock rubber pops

(Start: 00:19:24)
the rubber pump had loosened so much and stretched that no clamp would hold it in place and it keeps slipping off which was damn annoying especially when i needed it when i was in the middle of a race or something and that part would come off and ugly boost and the car would just kind of kill itself until it was sorted out so that happened the month before the 2020 lockdown as you guys know i have been distancing myself to protect my family from pretty much everyone it's also been difficult trying to sell these cars i've been standing 10 meters away and this is also why i'm making all these videos to try and avoid as much contact as possible with anybody that part blew off a month before i then couldn't get out to someone to fabricate which was very annoying because i wanted to get some aluminium pipes made up or even stainless steel pipes made up for the boost pipes so what i did at home the only thing i could do is i ordered online some silicone bins and a straight piece and

(Start: 00:20:24)
i'd made a makeshift let me see if you can see it on camera there we go you can see that i made a makeshift connector between the intercooler and the rest of the popping that goes into the intake the problem with that is it's collapsing under boost which sucks i don't know what's worse either blowing off or collapsing on the booth the car runs drives perfectly it starts up in like a heartbeat i'll start up in sick it's really really a beautiful machine it's got low mileage original mileage um to my knowledge 79 000ks i think that's what it was when it landed from japan and now it's sitting with a very low eighty seven thousand kilometers about two thousand of those kilometers were done in the last five years and then the other like six thousand

(Start: 00:21:25)
kilometers was done when i lived in joburg a couple of years ago um when we first got the car i took it straight up to jugger because that's where i was living and then did a couple trips durb and joburg and never had an issue with the car other than this flip and boost pipes and you guys can see everything's documented on my youtube channel i've had the boost pop issue like twice when i was hurtful for the lack of better words and when it sorted out lockdown happened and now i'm screwed so that is the story uh with the car it's been this car means a lot to me it's very personal i started writing names on it i started in you know respect you guys you guys have been enjoying this where you get your names written on the car there's like 3 000 something plus names that i've personally had written on each in every panel except the rear of the car never really got quiet to the rear but it pains me to see this car getting sold we're just

(Start: 00:22:27)
preparing in case we do need to leave or or anything like that and at least need to have money in the bank and not lying around here let me grab the keys i'll start up now and then hopefully it goes to a very very good home i'm slightly negotiable i'm looking at 615 000 ran all right here we go so that noise is the electric fan i'll always give it about 15 seconds plus minus just to let the fuel prime prime to switch the fan off just go over here done but seriously consider moving to a viscous nothing's not so great but it works okay so fuel pump is in my mind 100 primed and then it just starts oh by the way before i started i've got red leds it looks sick it looks really cool at night demonic almost uh are we in neutral yes we're neutral

(Start: 00:23:28)
let's go so so that's it the engine runs so smoothly i wish you guys could feel this there's like no vibrations on here at all look at my hand my hand is still i could probably put a coin on here like really nice movement [Music] no nothing so if you can see that there's like a little bit of smoke that comes out of here i'll close it up

(Start: 00:24:29)
i'll have a little figure out bit of need to get one of those filters or if you have a replacement stock or change it up that's the car it sounds good and it's it's always been damn reliable having an issue with the within skill apart which is rather unfortunate i just yeah i don't want to get out because [Music] so that all being said that is my skyline r32 gtr 1993 model is officially for sale 615 000 nearest cash offer let me have on instagram if you're really keen on buying the car uh we'll then take the conversation further offline possibly on well not possibly

(Start: 00:25:29)
all the telephone calls we need to if you're really really interested but that's my car hopefully you guys do a good home thanks so much for watching see you all next time

Title: My Stock RX7 Pre-Sale WALKAROUND
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1DYWvdZClk

(Start: 00:00:00)
hello and welcome to the for sale video of my black rx-7 fd 3s unfortunately it is provisionally sold i'm putting this video out more of a keepsake for memories and all of that but it might still come up for sale who knows the owner might change his mind no money has changed hands yet um this is the car so it's a 1997 touring x model okay let's jump into it straight away it's a lot cheaper than normal rx-7 models and the reason being it's an automatic now if you guys have been following my youtube channel for quite some time you would have known that i bought this car kind of by mistake long story short i bought it at like three in the morning i played the auctions in japan and i wanted an rx-7 i was losing for like three weeks i ended up putting on every single rx-7 the next morning i got a phone call from japan and i won this car found out it was an auto but it done by mistake anyway the cars here i redeemed myself by getting this type rs which is now officially sold but here it is it's an order they fetch plus minus retail in japan between 15

(Start: 00:01:02)
and about 20 000 u.s dollars plus minus as retail obviously auctions a lot cheaper anywhere between nine and a half ten thousand dollars to about fifteen thousand dollars that's excluding everything like duties shipping that etc etc that long list of stuff so this is an honest review of the car it was sitting outside so there's a bit of gear that's falling down it's early in the morning it's about seven degrees out here that's why i'm wearing this big puffy jersey jacket hoodie whatever it's cold so here's the car here's the issues let's start off with the obvious all right let's start with the first obvious thing you can see this panel isn't great and also the paint is very off that was a rattle can this was badly damaged it was all pushed in basically a forklift bangle at the port and i never really got it sorted out properly or at least finished so this panel was all pushed in you can see on some old pictures it's now been pushed out but it's not 100 still needs to be lined up and then obviously

(Start: 00:02:03)
filled sanded painted properly then on the back of the bumper you can see there's some like spider web cracks that's obviously from the impact some damage the tail lights are in perfect condition absolutely nothing wrong with them the rest of the bumper perfect nothing wrong with it tail lots to land up i mean to be honest this car is straight there's no other accident damage from where i can tell it's never been an accident so africa i've done about 800 kilometers since i imported this vehicle in 2016. hardly anything i've done less than that thing since that was important beginning of 2017. so this is an iphoney model touringx is a special edition they call them special editions because it has a sunroof and i think that was pretty much it on the touring x model but yeah as you can see on the right hand side there's a special edition touring x it came with 17-inch wheels these are

(Start: 00:03:04)
original mazda effind wheels the hubcap or the sensor caps are a bit discolored on this one on that side at least versus here and the wheels they do need to refresh they need to come off they need to be cleaned up this is more of like a project car to be honest there are some holes in the back here i've just got some tape over them so the water didn't go in the reason why there's some holes when the car from japan it had a veil side wing on which i'll throw in with the car if we don't negotiate too much it's a veil side attack wing it's sitting behind that bumper i'm not gonna go forwards too much but anyway it's the same one that was on the honda civics in the first fast and furious exactly the same way the whole brake assembly was sorted and fixed by myself and my father back in 2016 when the car landed there were some rust issues on control arm side also on the brake side so new front discs in the front old ones skimmed in the back

(Start: 00:04:06)
new pads in the front i don't think there were new pads in the back paint not fantastic this door is a slightly different color than the rest of the body i don't know why got it like that from japan there's a couple little scratches here and that's just dirt but there's a couple little scratches all over the place uh this is loose i haven't had a chance to fix that probably right now because of the sale um but that is loose it still works though loose there's a crack over here uh some cubond can sort it out this car has never really featured on my youtube channel because it's stock and kind of just parked it off with the intention to fix off camera i mean the content wouldn't be great if i put on youtube nobody would watch me fixing odds and ends like this they want to see what you guys want to see twin turbo stuff single server stuff cool stuff paint issues there was some surface rust on the roof this was blasted it was then done with

(Start: 00:05:07)
the rust reformer and then hammer out on top hasn't been sanded fully it's black hemorrhoid the color doesn't match so there's that one that one that one that one that one and then that big spot over there and that's it so i would say the entire car needs a respray it is straight it's clean the paint is that's a quick easy fix oh quick but i don't have the time same story at the bottom there was some surface rust over here rust reformer hammer out it needs to be sanded and all that jazz front bumper alignment is actually really good considering the age and also if you had to compare it to my silver one alignment on this one is actually a lot better with regards to the tires there's some potencies on here these are potensa s double zero one and then on the back there's some bridge stones they're really old the tread isn't fantastic on the rears um i would get that sorted out

(Start: 00:06:10)
i would change these tires i think they roughly 12 or 13 years old uh from what i remember i don't see the numbers on there anymore and then there's a little bit of discoloration here on the paint like i said the entire coil will need to be re-sprayed i would suggest it needs to be restrained but there's almost no dents on the car and if there are they're really tiny and i'm missing them i'm trying to make this as honest as possible from what i remember if there's anything i'm missing you know it's one of those things like i've forgotten because i don't drive the car it's it's dirty it's but it's keen and it's a really good base as a project so here are those those are rare carpets those are cherry blossom carpets uh there is an rx7 badge for that that's sitting in the cubby hole um steering wheel is stock nothing else in the wheel handbrake leather stock it's an automatic it's got the drive neutral low low range in sport mode it does not rev as high as a normal rx7

(Start: 00:07:13)
in the manual so it only revs up to like six and a half ish which also means that the engine would not have been for lack of better words raped or not raped as badly interior-wise it's a bit upsetting when the car raft there were some gauges over here and they drilled into the dash so they would need to be refilled i never did it around it they would need to be filled and patched up the rest of the dash is clean nothing nothing done to it uh air conditioning doesn't work everything is there though the aircon pumps it comes on when you switch it on but i'm assuming there's no gas i have the same story with this rx-7 aircon came on pump came on all that stuff no gas i don't know if it's a japanese thing when the cars were shipped from here i just never really got them around to to getting re-gas because i don't drive them uh rear seats are clean they are leather in the back that's stock they all come later in the back and then cloth here this seat has got a cigarette burn rather annoying came like that from

(Start: 00:08:15)
japan i don't smoke uh that seat is clean uh the rest of the seat is clean it's i mean it's it's it's decent there's nothing wrong with it the cushion's still there it's just that annoying burn i don't know if that can be repaired probably needs to be recovered it's got the rx7 kick panels the aluminium ones and then before we start it up let's take a look at the engine bay this car and nice thing about it it's 100 stock one thing i forget the exhaust the exhaust is a piece of the exhaust is the stock exhaust all the way from the front from the turbos 100 stock except the tips were rusty and the aluminium portion of the tips fell off like a week or two after owning the car there's actually a video somewhere in my channel i'm too lazy to find it when i do the edit but this video it actually flew off on the freeway engine is stuck absolutely nothing done to the engine except for this aluminium plate here

(Start: 00:09:18)
with the grub screws that is your air separation tank every single rx-7 has that it's basically a system that works the bubbles out of your ear in the radiator now the issue is the plastic is old it gets brittle and it starts to leak it happened on this card it happened on my rx-7 i believe it happens to 90 of rx-7 owners what we did on both cars is we made plates to hold the two pieces the top and the bottom of it put some grub screws in and then filled it up with some silicone around it does not leak it's really good now i'll probably spray that black to make it look more oem that's the only thing that is done to this car everything else on here is in complete stock standard form it does need a detail it would look a lot better the detail stock air box there's a filter i don't remember if i change the filter to be honest everything's done everything else is stuck headlights work even though there's a little crack on that side um like i said the crack can be sorted

(Start: 00:10:20)
out but if you push the headlight switch they come up really quick yeah see decent so here's all the ac stuff um that and that and the turns it works it comes on with the switch i don't know what the story is it could be an issue the car has a hundred and forty something thousand kilometers on it let me double to check confirm that uh it's a digital digital supply so you have the keys hundred and forty thousand six hundred and ninety six and i've done about two kilometers in the last uh i don't know yeah there's a front loader unfortunately it's not the standard one it's a jvc double din that's been used probably about three times picked it up in late 2016 beginning of

(Start: 00:11:22)
2017 because the one that was anyhow wasn't working and i've just never really played music gutters called probably played three songs that's it okay door cards are neat everything's fun on the door cards except for two things this here this is out when i came from japan the clips were broken there's one clip over here and there's no clip on this side and they've put tape on there so it doesn't sit in last year's it's a little bit annoying this could probably just be glued if you're never going to take it out change the speakers first then so that's the one issue and then this guy over here the one side is bust so there's supposed to be something that like keeps it in place there it's supposed to be stuck like that uh yeah that's broken that's the control for the radio so that's annoying that could be sorted out easily and then the final thing is

(Start: 00:12:22)
engine the car smokes white smoke so does the silver but silver for way less uh the cost marks white smoke in winter time for about two to three minutes and then in summertime it smokes white smoke for about a minute it did this when it arrived from japan and it was it did it quite prominently when it arrived from japan and then it's dart down now and it hardly happens anymore i'm assuming it's the water seal that's leaking slightly and letting through because it's quite a sweet smell i'm pretty sure it's radiator fluid however the radiator fluid levels don't change so i don't know slightly potential rebuild in the future i did daily this car for and when i say daily my work is like three kilometers i daily that for about two months just prior to lockdown the 2020 lockdown from like end of 2019 i started dailing this car i did probably about eight nine hundred kilometers on it and no issues i was happier i haven't started today it's been sitting here for a while

(Start: 00:13:24)
battery actually runs nicely the car stays plugged in uh battery lasts like three four five weeks before it actually starts draining it starts off instantly as you can see that i mean that could be condensation look look what's coming out on the floor it's a lot more prominent in winter and it's seven degrees right now there's a couple driving videos there's a video on my channel called i'll link the description called a point of view is it worth buying an automatic rx cip and i drive the car on the street boosted on the streets it's quite enjoyable to drive obviously the manual counterpart is a lot more fun and you have a lot more control let me turn the car around quickly good thing i jumped in because the rev

(Start: 00:14:25)
counter it's a very common issue on the rx7 my silver one's fun though but the rev counter does it comes alive sometimes with a good work but yeah so i'm in reverse right now and it's got that annoying charm a heat light is on that came on when i swapped the exhaust so this exhaust actually belonged to the silver card was completely stock and i figured let me finalize this car and make it fully stuck by throwing in the exhaust when i did that the heat plug came on so if you research it generally says blocked cat causes the heat plate and i've had it with the heat light for i don't know two and a half years and it's hasn't been an issue costly very very cold

(Start: 00:15:28)
i warmed it up for like two minutes before i started turning around that's one thing with the with the rx-7s you've got to make sure they're warm before you hit boost before you stop driving all that sort of stuff it's been on for about two minutes now i'm just reversing it let's go take a look at the smoke look reef crown is trying to fix itself yeah i think it runs very smoothly for what it is until the year and this is unopened as far as i know 140 000 kilometers let's see what the smoking looks like

(Start: 00:16:40)
pretty much nothing i could see a tiny little white puff that's about outside this has been about three and a half four minutes now and there's there's almost nothing so look i think it might be a water seal and it's probably gonna take a very very long time for it to completely die so i think all in all it's a decent project call for the price i'm asking 235 000 rand for it or nearest cash offer like i said to get these in from japan you'll be paying much more and you don't know what the car looks like no one's going to do this sort of review in the car especially if you're buying from an auction you're just not gonna get that every video i make i've got hardy dolls coming at me like right above me anyway that's the end of the video if you guys are interested please hit me up on instagram like i said there is a pending offer on the car provisionally sold it may be going

(Start: 00:17:40)
i'm putting this video up more for sentimental value it'll be the last time i do anything with this car anyway thank you so much for watching appreciate it we'll see all the next one peace

Title: My MR2 SW20 Pre-Sale WALKAROUND
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGd_WmPu6Co

(Start: 00:00:00)
welcome to the for sale video of my mr2 sw20 hoping the wind noise is not so bad unfortunately i left the car here during the civil unrest and well i'm going to take it home shortly i figured i'd do the the video here because then i'm not worried by kids and all that drama at home so i'm selling every single one of my jdm cars be sure to check out my other videos on my instagram post and you'll see all the process all the details this however is the video for my mr2sw20 it is a 1991 model it's a g limited and it's a t-top okay you don't find a lot of these in south africa you do find some t-tops but you don't find often g limited models these cars were never imported into the country as collectible vehicles so the only way to get one of these in the country is to be a returning resident meaning you need to work overseas for 12 months and own the vehicle and then you can bring it back to south africa legally as a returning resident that's what happened on this car this was brought in many many many years ago not by me this was brought in in the middle 90s i think 95 96 by returning

(Start: 00:01:01)
resident so it was sabs approved at the time and registered on our system and it's just like a normal car this has the kooky lights in it i think that's how you say it the kooky lots it looks better than what the usual ones have the other ones have got like this indent here with a big mr2 logo this looks way better and neater it actually shaves years of the car i don't have the stock wheels it came with some really shoddy 15s these are 17's they're also pretty cheapies the tires on there are pretty good the paintwork on the car isn't great it does need a respray i'll be honest about that i'm going to try being as honest as possible about every single thing on the car i may forget one or two things but i just want to let everyone know all the issues from the get-go so paintwork i did have the car re-sprayed from fender to the front the paint job was not great it was a really cheap paint job we didn't finish the polishing and all that so this bunch of pit marks over

(Start: 00:02:02)
here don't know if you can actually see that there's like a few small pit marks that needs a bit more polishing here the bumper cracked when we're fitting so it could do some touch-ups a little bit more cracking over here when we fit in lots and then the bottom needs a decent polish this side looks a lot better the bonnet was also redone re-sprayed again needs a polish i did it at home we did it in like an hour myself and a few friends so it needs a lot more time spent in it the rest of the car hasn't been touched by the way the color coding was done it was done by mix and match so identical black you can't tell the difference that's that's polish just by the way um there's a couple ping pong bands here and there on the vehicle it is a non-sciency one so you gotta remember that it is a t-top version which means these come out this one and that one and then you just store it away in the boot or

(Start: 00:03:04)
you store it away in your rear seats behind the rear seats we'll open the car up in a second like i said a few ping pong dents here and there the light's on pretty good nick it's got all the badging toyota badge it's got the g limits of badge in the back all color coded so if the car is red it will have red tiered logo all that stuff there's some weird like paint mark over here that's like white i've never tried to get that off didn't really bother me too much the exhaust on the car is horrific it's mild steel all the way and then it's just got these two little aluminium tips it's rusty it's noisy there were some holes in it i never had it professionally patched i threw some gun gum on it and that seemed to fix the issue but i hear the noise is back now this trim over here or the beading it's like flaking i'll just put black paint in it i didn't have time much like the black rx-7 it hasn't really been a car that i've posted much on the youtube channel itself so i haven't really done a lot of work

(Start: 00:04:05)
on it whereas my gtr my rx7 i spend a lot more time because the content is interesting for you guys as an audience me spending time doing those waste of time i was gonna keep this car i was gonna keep all the cars in the long run and i would have done this in time unfortunately i've got to sell the cars now here's the interior uh the number plate got ruined when we did the respray because i kind of double-sided taped it and then when we pulled it off it got all crinkled and crashed anyway you'll be changing number flights anyway from the car door cards are in very good neck except for this little chip over here on the door card other than that door cards are alright dashboard is clean there's a small indent right over there other than that no issues on the dashboard from what i can see all the clips are available everything's there there's a cubby hole over here random cd there's a front loader it's a pioneer front loader

(Start: 00:05:07)
there's the seats are fully operational there's a little subwoofer built in amplifier that myself and jono fitted to the car speakers are working seat belts are here all the trim is still okay a little bit dirty i wasn't expecting to do this video right now probably should have cleaned it up but anyway it is what it is it's completely honest in this review seat goes back here's a little cubbyhole everything is here everything works there's some additional storage here's another one it's got a sparkle wheel i do have the original wheel for it that will go with the car but it's not in great condition it's not here it's at home uh issue of the sparkle i couldn't get the horn to work the car has got 217 000 kilometers on it it's a manual it's manual from factory and then let's take a look at the engine

(Start: 00:06:07)
bay now i ran a kill switch on this car because for some reason it zaps the battery after like a week or two whereas the other cars that i own other jdms it runs fine so i'll put a kill switch over there just turn that and then the car gets power all i did was just put it on onto the negative terminal headlights are working underneath of the car is pretty clean uh suspension is stuck it's uh it's got quite the right height here it's it's not not pretty engine bay is completely stuck to open up it gets the engine bay you gotta pull the seat forwards and then there's a latch somewhere here right there this latch well the engine bay is not the neatest it is a stock 3s ge i think the power rating was 122 kilowatts or 118

(Start: 00:07:09)
kilowatts and 200 and something newton meters of torque look the car goes it's not slow it's not a slouch there's some additional storage space in the boot so there is actually a boot there it is not bad definitely put a set of golf clubs or something in here maybe more sound if you into that and then let me start it up for you guys it sounds very raspy it's got that whole teota sound to it so kill switch on this video is certainly not going to be as long as the others because this car is completely stock other than the wheels and the steering wheel this car's got an immobilizer on it so

(Start: 00:08:12)
you gotta push this button that thing pops up in the dash and then we're neutral starts up straight away that's a tiara you know what to serve our toyotas or at least what jeremy clarkson says this is a run the rear over here is pretty damaged it's just been painted over but as i mentioned earlier this car is due for respray probably from i mean you could respray the whole thing that will probably be beneficial but from the fenders back it needs a re-spray certainly no show car but it's not bad either it really isn't for the year this is the original paint except for here uh there's some little paint issues here on that one t-top and then all the interior for the t-top is here so if you want some sun while you're driving you just loosen that [Music]

(Start: 00:09:15)
and you can rock it like that or you can pull the entire t-top off um i don't have my camera stand here one-handed so let's put this down so i do have a few extras or spares if you want to call them that for the vehicle i've got the the rear lights the original ones that came with the vehicle the zenki ones plus the garnish at the back it's got the kooky ones on it now which look way better and they're also valued quite high so if you want to get them replaced they sell sets anywhere between a thousand and a thousand five hundred us dollars for refurbed versions so that's a good 15 to 18k already on the car plus i've got the originals what else do i have got the original stock steering wheel and that's about it oh i've got a front lip for the car i've never fitted it just having a thumb and it's not the content i'd be pushing on the channel

(Start: 00:10:16)
but i've got a front lip for it all that being said the vehicle value has risen much like every other jdm car out there and i'll be looking at a hundred and fifteen thousand rand for this vehicle with 3sge remember it's 91 g limited t-top edition needs a little bit of work it's reliable as is drives well and it's quick because it's so loud it's quick it's 115 000 ran negotiable i'm willing to negotiate slightly please i've already had some dude wanting to swap the tears yeah we'll move on from that so thank you so much for watching if you want to chat to me if you're a serious serious genuine buyer chat to me on instagram first we'll start up a conversation there and then if you're really really really keen on it i'll give you my phone number thanks so much for watching see you next one peace

Title: My Single Turbo RX-7 FD3S Pre-Sale WALKAROUND
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNyocJKBomw

(Start: 00:00:00)
this is the official walk around video for my rx-7 fd3s the type rs the silver one behind me as i addressed in the previous video i'm selling every single one of my jdm cars i'm doing a walk around right now for every single one of them uploading the video separately adding this to adverts etc just to put buyers minds at ease the black one in the background is provisionally sold i'm not going to be doing a video on that right now unless things get sour but this is my type rs it's in 1997. imported it myself all the paperwork is done i've got everything i've got the artec documents i've got the nrcs documents i've got data dot i've got police clearance i've got our tech clearing uh sorry not our tech um interpol clearance literally have everything that needed to be done and the car is fully road reg now there are hundreds of hours of project work that i actually did on this car from the day it arrived here there's been vlogs there's been driving videos there's been all sorts of videos of this car then i embarked on a single turbo journey so this is gonna be quite a long video we're gonna run through starting

(Start: 00:01:01)
in the front we're gonna move all the way to the back i'm gonna try and show floors as honest as i can from what i remember first of all it is an unopened from my knowledge rotary 13b it had a twin turbo setup it's been pulled out this is the second variation of single turbo work that i've done the turbo sponsored by a friend of mine shark this is a whole set h1e turbo which is about the size of an hx35 from my knowledge it's got a custom v-mount intercooler radiator sitting at a v-angle so that basically the air rushes in through the front and then it hits both of them equally or at least that is the theory behind it radiator pipes are all custom this was all done in my garage by myself and with the help of some friends so it might not be the greatest but it was something that we did and it's working now obviously to do a single turbo setup there's a lot of work that goes behind it and a lot of stuff that got deleted one of the things that has been added is a dna motor sports manifold

(Start: 00:02:02)
that's holding this h1e super large turbo it's actually really big there is an exhaust leak somewhere about here i'm not entirely sure where exactly i haven't spent a lot of time trying to figure that out but there's a slight exhaust that can be fixed one of the things that i was planning and i would have liked to have done but i never got around to doing it was getting a smaller air separation tank so that's the stock one it's a modified stock one so it doesn't leak because that's a common thing it's happening on this car it's happened on this one the tank the plastic on the tank just gets frail and it starts it springs a leak so that setup seems to work well with the grub screws and the plates around it um i did want to change that ast or do an ast delete never got around to it i've got so many project cars that i just don't spend the time on one there is an external waistcoat on the car uh it's it's a no-name brand it's from mr turbo same with a dump valve from mr turbo you can see there's a boost solenoid over

(Start: 00:03:02)
there that's from an hks evc5 i'll get to that that's an interior the engine bay is pretty clean okay i mean it's dirty but it's clean as in there's no rust or no rust that i can see it's still got the factory paint and the strut bars it looks decent it actually really looks good and i think the gold and the red complement the engine bay it's got a strut brace which cam stock on this model and this is the type rs so let me explain type rs type rs is a special edition this is in 1997 so at 1997 they redid the rat's nest so the rat's nest would be under the uim the upper intake manifold the rats nest referred to the vacuum hoses that were there for all the solenoids and control of the twin turbo setup which was ridiculous this is also a 97 and the rat's nest was simplified on that car too but all of that junk is out now obviously the type of rs also had steel wheels in the turbos that's all out it's all single turbo now so one of the

(Start: 00:04:03)
nice things about the type rs are the brakes if you look at the caliper this is the front caliper and the disc the disk size and the caliper are vastly different to a normal rx-7 now this rx-7 this is a touring x it's also a limited edition but it's a limited edition in its own way where it had a sunroof and a few other small things but nothing performance wise if you look at the brake disc setup on this car i don't think you guys can see too well because the lighting but this setup and the caliper are a lot smaller see if you can see the caliper size here versus that okay so something like a good example if you guys know subaru's this would be more in line with like a brembo orphan sti versus that of a wrx with the standard subaru brakes that's the setup the rears i'm actually not too sure no the rears are stock so the rears are the same as this car

(Start: 00:05:07)
look the brakes do need to refresh there is a hell hel brake line kit that i've got that was meant for this car um obviously that will get thrown in i'm going to try and throw in as many spares as possible the price for this vehicle is 315 000 round that i'm looking at i am gonna throw in a new top bumper so it's the the cool looking one i'll show you guys in a second and it comes with some headlights sorry not headlights it comes with the lights that fit into the bumper so this is the old style there's some super cool ones that i've been meaning to fit for a little while now if the price doesn't change so if you take it for 315 i'll throw that in it's 10 grams worth of stuff so it's a bumper and i've got three lights one is a spare i think it's the right hand side if we negotiate i'm gonna pull that out and i'll sell that separately because there's a hell of a demand for that another thing on the type aureus that is different to other rx7s there are fog lights on this car type rs came standard with fog lights that's remained unchanged

(Start: 00:06:07)
this car doesn't have the fog lights here's the vehicle information for this car as you can see it says type rs special edition tells you the fuel tab tells you the transmission type engine type etc and then one important thing on the left hand side it says suspension hard s so the suspension on this car is actually notably lower than a standard rx-7 that both have standard setups with regards to suspension however from factory this had semi-adjustable suspension so you can adjust the stiffness that's it you kind of just ride hot but i think that's good enough the right heart i mean the car is really low enough which is pretty cool unfortunately when i was out here yesterday i forgot to put the cover back on so there's a little bit of dew but this car always remains covered

(Start: 00:07:08)
and i don't have i didn't have time later on in the day to do another video so you've got to excuse a little bit of g on the car the last and final thing that was different with the type rs is that the diff has got different ratios so i believe this diff ratio i forget the numbers exactly i did a lot of research when the car first landed but i actually don't remember the figures exactly but the div is very very different to a stock rx-7 and it's more rated or more geared for track work because this car does have an hks back box hk's back back box with a custom 76mm all the way to the turbo it's very very loud it's early in the morning i'm not gonna be able to start the car right now uh you guys can hear it from previous video

(Start: 00:08:18)
[Music] all right let's talk about what else is in the car before we get started on some of the issues because i want to be as honest as possible things that are i remember there are issues i'm going to be mentioning the video battery has been relocated to the rear however i didn't get around to bolting it down um i mean some self tappers and whatnot that can sort it out like i said i've got so many projects i'll just jump between them and i try and make youtube videos particularly for content so some stuff might be sitting on the back burner with regards to the interior i have a blitz dual turbo timer i've got all the rx-7 trim these mats are rare they're very rare these are the cherry blossom a lot of people don't like the style i think they're pretty cool they're different um funnily enough this car's got them as well and then it's got an hks evc boost controller that's a display for it here's the actual boost controller

(Start: 00:09:19)
itself double-sided tape could do with a refresh so that's falling a little bit there's a jvc front loader with a six disk change in the back old school it came from japan like that i haven't bought the changing there's a apexi power rfc ecu down there uh it's all the kick panels are there the interior is all here it's just lying on the floor there because there's a tuning cable in it which i can't sell with the car because it's actually not mine someone's got it online to me but you can buy one from powerfc dot net or data log at datalogger.net or summing.com there's also an aem wideband in the car that's fully functional that's tapped into the down part or just off the downpipe [Music] and then my favorite part of the car okay favorite part of the car is up here okay well that's a little speaker for it the control units just tucked in over here somewhere

(Start: 00:10:25)
anytime now now okay so that's an electronic toll collection system it's basically just telling you please insert memory card i've decided to leave it in the car because well i think it's a cool addition another nice thing that i have with the vehicle is service history from japan i have the full service booklet this car was serviced at mazda in japan i don't remember when what day to stop getting service at mazda in japan but i remember that the kilometers were quite high when it did stop it's sitting on 102 000 kilometers this is genuine there was a service over here by mazda oh there we go 93 461 and then i think there was nothing done for about 7000k when the car landed here landed with 101 000 something i've done less than a thousand kilometers on the car okay let's talk about issues i want to

(Start: 00:11:26)
be honest there are quite a few issues things that i possibly haven't shown in the vlog or never really spoke about because there was just no reason to but let's run through it so one of the obvious things is it's not complete it's a project car it always has been i had big plans for this car i've been doing everything myself um but again with so many projects i keep jumping and changing purely for content so i can try and keep the audience happy you guys happy and uh cooler stuff so like i've got the r33 that i've been doing a lot of work on and this has been sitting on the back burner so one of the things it needs is a better fuel system it's running very rich on idle i'm battling to control the fueling because i'm running the stock fuel pressure regulator and it's just not working so well with the setup or the big single turbo setup here so i've sat with some tuners and particularly baitec in scotland and we've confirmed issues with regards to fueling um fpr is

(Start: 00:12:27)
an issue the stock one is trash and not suitable for the setup the only reason i didn't change it is because i was kind of nervous and scared to change or touch feeling at the time doing it by myself subsequently just prior to the riots this is why i'm selling the car because no point in having these cool cars if they could just get burned down any minute by rioters um i was gonna be doing the fuel setup i spoke to fuel performance lots here today i actually ordered some adapters i'm still waiting for those to arrive that fuel pressure regulator needs to be changed i'll throw in i've got a to my fuel pressure regulator that's meant for this car you can get that set up and i need fuel pumps um better fuel pipe still got the stock fuel bump in it which is kind of sad that means that the car is not 100 drivable it starts you can travel it in and out your driveway but it's it's lumpy it hasn't been tuned for the single turbo setup and that's the problem so it's lumpy uh it's also over fueling on idle so occasionally it floods itself i've

(Start: 00:13:28)
had to do the d flood process probably 10 times in the last year on this car so that's an annoying issue that can be resolved with fueling that's the biggest issue on the car right now and then there's a few minor ones one uh it's quite embarrassing but when i was doing the single server setup i'll end up dropping a bolt into the engine bay didn't just go anywhere it fell into the oil feed and it went all the way down into the sump we heard it go pink into the sump i've run that camera there's old youtube videos you can actually go search for that if you're wondering and it's now wedges itself between the plate and some out at the bottom and i'll have to take out the entire sum to get that bolt out and that's just something i don't have time for and because there's no cams because the rotary there's no chance of this actually touching anything mechanical that will you know cause an engine issue so i've kind of just left it and it was one of those things i did want to get sorted out in the future so there's a bolt in there that needs to come out and then we've got a couple cosmetic issues on the vehicle

(Start: 00:14:29)
one of them is clear coat so you can see over there it's it's a little bit lighter on the roof than the rest of the car um there's a little bit of an issue over there it's just clear coat it's not a massive deal i was going to get this car re-sprayed like a the mr2 but never got around to the bonnet has the same issues you can see there where it's a little bit lighter that's clear coat there's some clear-cut chipping over there and some clear coat issues on that side mirror for the most part the car is neat so barren monitor is a 1997 so there are a few minor imperfections there's some little paint chips over here on the door itself there's some tiny little paint chips over there but it is actually in really good condition if you consider the year because instead of the mileage and if you consider the price being a limited edition or special

(Start: 00:15:30)
edition oh yes something else that the type rs has is this backboard i think it was an optional extra this car doesn't have it and a few other fds that i've seen that don't have the backboard um other issues there's some tiny little scratches over here i haven't actually tried getting them out maybe that can come out i don't know uh there's some little scratches over here and then a another graph for me is that the the fitment or the alignment of the bumper isn't spot on and this is why i bought that whole new bumper setup i mean this can be fixed it just needs to be pulled to the one side but i bought that other setup because i feel that these lights are very dated and it gives a bad look to the car and that's why i got that other bumper and lights to make it look cooler but you can see the alignment is off here substantially off that's about a mil off there which means it has a knock-on effect over there and a knock-on effect over here so when the bonnet's closed doesn't look fantastic actually it's not that bad here's a paint chip over here on the bumper and then that's

(Start: 00:16:31)
pretty much it to my knowledge of issues on the vehicle i do have some spares that that belongs to this vehicle um a lot of them i've given away already i have thought i was being a nice guy and just yeah i gave some parts away but that that's whatever that can't be used on here anyway this is a big single server all the parts that i had were twin turbo parts i do have a spare turbo for this car that fits for here it's actually meant for an rx-7 ft3s it's an excess power turbo it's a little bit smaller and a lot more responsive than the one that's on the car so that will go with this vehicle another issue i'm not too happy with my boost bumps so once you do get this car running i would suggest changing my boost pops first of all this needs to be trimmed down i think it needs to be trimmed over there because the top is just rubbing slightly on the bonnet one that does need to be cleaned up as well and i would probably get i forget what you call it but you like put a lip on the actual indicator pop so that these clamps don't don't jump off there is a name for that i forgot the name i had these super cool brackets made

(Start: 00:17:34)
they're really really heavy duty so there's brackets coming from here and they're holding the intercooler up russell from rustic race engineering it was kind enough to sponsor me the brackets and make them specific so guys that is the story with this car that's from my knowledge that's all the issues um i don't know what else to say the car is for sale 315 000 negotiable if you don't want the front bumper and the lights this bumper can still be realigned properly i mean it's not really bad at all it's it's really sad that i'm i'm having to get rid of these vehicles and i addressed this in the previous video but yeah there's there's no way around this there's just no point in having these cool things and uh we're just too close to comfort uh like i mentioned the rioters i've got hottie dolls flying over the rioters were like 800 meters line of sight and they were piling down there and it was just like like i said too close for comfort um what is the point of

(Start: 00:18:37)
owning five jdm legends and they can all get taken away you noisy bastard well that's it if you guys want to contact me let's start up a conversation on instagram first i don't want to just give out my number because i'll get spammed for other random junk i don't want to entertain random phone calls if you're not serious about voting buying the vehicle then i'm sorry i don't particularly have time to chat i put them up for sale yesterday and i had plus minus 200 dms so if you really and truly are interested in the vehicle hit me up on instagram first we'll start the conversation on there and then we can exchange phone numbers if it really gets serious and you're at the point where you want to buy the vehicle i'm not just going to hand out my phone number to anybody we'll start the conversation there or perhaps move to email or something but yeah we'll we'll chat if you really are serious hit me up instagram nellcal jdm sad to see the but thank you so much for watching

(Start: 00:19:41)
see y'all next one peace

Title: It's all over.

(Start: 00:00:00)
so here's the deal a week and a half ago we decided to evacuate our home there was massive crazy unrest in in durban wow uh basically you could see hoards of people crossing over a highway into the area now where the warehouses are in a durban neighborhood residents are taking matters into their own hands

(Start: 00:01:00)
amid widespread violence in south africa some have armed themselves with baseball bats and guns short story long our former president was jailed for corruption uh i think he stole something like 500 billion rand that's about 40 plus minus billion dollars i think my master's right and anyway he got jailed and people and his followers didn't like this so there was a mass riot across two provinces haoting johannesburg et cetera and quesadilla durbin specifically durbin where warehouses got burned shopping centers got bit i'm gonna throw a couple stats up here um like 400 and something pep stores like the pep stores if you're not from south africa or they do clothing they do i don't know some do food some do appliances like white box products and they were completely destroyed 400

(Start: 00:02:03)
and something of them affected some were burned down to the ground major warehouses that stock food for retailers so we we're talking thousands and thousands of looters the police were battling um security guards security companies they all joined forces with the public vigilante group started popping up little militias within town sort of popping up anyone who had a gun that was a civilian was getting called out to assist um these looters and rioters were attacking power plants or substations they were dropping power in areas so that it would be more difficult for armed forces to actually stop them from coming in in the evenings and i mean they were looting from 48 hours straight nonstop and thousands and thousand thousand of them and some of them were armed and it was just ridiculous and they set fire to most places diluted afterwards warehouses storage facilities cold storage was it was insane and why we left is because

(Start: 00:03:06)
we are a stone throw away from north coast road we're a little bit high up um but we're pretty damn close like 800 meters line outside the problem is they started hitting it hard and we saw in the news that there were thousands of them marching on andy drive and they were coming our way we didn't know they were going to stop at massmot the warehouse that supplies macro game and all that stuff we thought they were coming into residential so we just packed up everything or as much as we could i'm back home thankfully back home it's been a long week and a half ran out of time yesterday trying to film a little video for you guys so carrying on from today we packed up what we could and we took animals we took our cats we took out dogs we took everything else we went and stayed with my parents because it was a little bit more fortified and and also you know like a whole strength and numbers thing we felt a little bit safer going there it was incredibly frightening with all the stuff happening just a couple hundred meters away from our home things getting burned it and you know we said that we wouldn't

(Start: 00:04:08)
leave that we wouldn't go to my parents we wouldn't go anywhere else because we were thinking maybe let's go to cape town you know get away from and get out of the province not that there are any planes leaving anyway but we just said no you know what we'll just stay put we'll be fine we've got cameras alarms security you know all that sort of stuff look at the dogs and then my daughter said why is this smoke outside and we're like get out of here let's get out of here and then we saw the news thousands and thousands of people heading our way anyway um it's affected so much and i just firstly before i carry on with the story i just want to really say by the way i'm not crying my nose is blocked it's very very cold it's like seven degrees right now see say um you to everybody who sent me a comment wishing me well on instagram youtube i haven't replied to everybody for example the mick i know you sent me a comment on youtube i read it i haven't replied it's been

(Start: 00:05:08)
mad we've been living out a little one bedroom off my parents place where i used to live um not in their main house and it's just been hectic with the kids and we're waking each other up and it's just it's been madness and plus trying to work from home there has been a nightmare and that's why we're back now that's why we're back home it's safe now so thank you to everybody who's taken the time and people who actually care and just don't know what else to say thank you the real scary part is that a lot of these chains were burned down a lot of their warehouses and storage facilities are burnt down so there's been a shortage of food coupled with panic buying people panicked by we saw cues and cues as you can see right now i used to shop at that particular shopping center we used to live around the corner from there the checkers before we moved to this house like literally i could walk there in a minute and a half and to see the queues and thousands of thousands of people panic by and then when we tried to go we didn't want to go during the panic buying stuff

(Start: 00:06:08)
because we still scared of covert we very scared of cover we don't leave the house and we were forced to leave the house we had to go and buy supplies because we were running out of baby for me we were running out of baby nappies and we only had like two weeks worth of food at this stage our shops are still not fully stocked up and north um if you're not from kazadan whatever it's a little bit further north north hillcrest upper hallway they're fully stocked urban north is still not so great so if you go to like a spa you might find that a couple atoms are still missing dog food is still a bit scarce the vets are getting it but price is a little bit higher than normal and anyway we still need to get some dog food some cat litter but a week ago we were unsure i was actually making plans i was rationing the dogs we were rationing i was managing one meal so my wife and i we were we were eating one less meal than what we were supposed today because we wanted to ensure that our kids had food and our kids would have at least a month supply of food my parents were absolute stars though they were just

(Start: 00:07:08)
they managed to stockpile just prior i think they were going to the berg or something so they just bought a whole food luckily they had a lot holiday food so we were able to eat i was making plans already that what if we couldn't feed the cats would if we couldn't feed the dogs do we have to put them down what are we going to do we didn't know how long this is going to last everyone is locked down we're doing patrols in the evening there there was militia outside um barricading roads and stopping people coming in absolutely mind blowing anyway you can research you can figure it out if you're not from south africa just search on youtube so african riots 2021 or south african unrest those of you who live in south africa you know what i went through if you live in keizerden you'll really know what happened keizer in god hit hard heltang you guys got it too but casey then that being said here's the part where you guys are going to hate me the most now when we left we gave ourselves like an hour we get

(Start: 00:08:10)
estimated that if these guys were down there and they were heading this way that would take them like an hour and a half two hours but judging by the way they were walking i mean they were literally walking with spears and and these looters and and angry protesters they had weapons which are scary i mean i understand protest go for it express your views do all that but then causing destruction and scaring my children that's a big no for me not that you care what i think but we gave ourselves like an hour to leave get the dogs get the cats get food we took our deep freeze across my parents house because they didn't have enough space in their fridge and freezer to keep my children's food and it's freeze a lot of our stuff um and one thing i couldn't take a crossword cars which was a massive concern for me because that's that's my meal ticket at the end of the day my cars are worth a lot of money now as you all know the jdm car prices are through the roof and i had to leave my cars beyond i managed to take one in a rush because purely it just it was

(Start: 00:09:12)
right here in front and it was the easiest to get out and that was the mrcsw20 i took the mr2 and i took the lexus took it to my parents house and uh that was it and for about two or three days i'm going to say i don't have to wear this like i was under the impression that i was going to lose my cars i i came to the realization that my cars would be burnt down and they would be looted because i was so close to all the [ __ ] that was happening so in my mind i had already said goodbye to my gtr the more x7 another rx-7 endless hunk of junk by the time you're watching this video i would have already started doing an inventory taking photos washing the cars taking videos for each one i'm putting every single one of my jdm cars up for sale

(Start: 00:10:15)
not because i need the money but because i feel that i'm not safe in this country anymore i have never once not felt safe never once wanted to leave my brother's gone he lived to new zealand he's gone and did his own thing he's in new zealand i have never once wanted to leave the country and that's why i've built so much here and that's why i have so many assets with regards to cars and everything else because i love this place it's beautiful i have friends here i have family here i've got everything i want you land is good land is semi-cheap i've got the cars i've got the support i've got everything i want my kids they go to school they're happy they've got friends um we we just never wanted to leave and i'm not saying we're gonna leave right now but we need to be prepared and having that many cars here i don't feel safe anymore and i don't feel safe earning this and and why

(Start: 00:11:16)
should i own something and this is this is why i'm so upset now is why should i own something when i could lose it tomorrow because i don't no longer feel safe in this country anymore everything i've built everything i've worked towards could go like that and no insurance nothing will get back something that i built to my standards for myself the gtr i built the way i wanted it to be built the way i loved it it might not be perfect it's far from perfect and i'm going to make honest videos because i know like my wiring is up to [ __ ] um i've done my own wiring it might not be as per standard those sort of things but it's my car and i love it but why should i own it if it could get taken away from me tomorrow and this [ __ ] ain't over yet it's gonna happen again and it's gonna happen worse and we need to be prepared to get out of here

(Start: 00:12:17)
without a lot of baggage so i don't know where we're going with my youtube channel right now so that's that's the one i'm still passionate about jdm cars i'm still gonna create content it's just gonna i'm gonna have to make it different and with covert around it's not gonna be easy and and you know i thought about this and i've slept on this and i know i'm rambling and this is probably just a [ __ ] video for you guys to especially hear those but if you really are interested in buying my cars send me a dm on instagram they are market related the prices are not going to be cheap so you're looking r32 sell anywhere between 600k and 700k now if you had to import one from japan rx 7ft 3s between 250 to 350 and then special editions much higher bear in mind myself one's a type rs mr2sw20 for normally aspirated like mine anywhere between

(Start: 00:13:17)

is the aluminium mesh right aluminium mesh with some fiberglass bond underneath and then on the top will be bondo i don't know what to do here with the camera angles because i'm going to be working from underneath here you can't see anything anyway because yeah and then here well you can't see anything so what i do no point in doing a time-lapse so you guys can just see the finished product but here's the mesh the mesh is going to go on the underside i've got some fibro gel this is fiberglass gel stinks while i'm waiting for that fiber agility to dry i've been meaning to do this for a little while on the first gear i want to i want to put some gauges in here i've got a lot of stuff we'll go through it in a second and then i'm just going to decide what i'm going to do but first of all i need to cut a template

(Start: 00:05:22)
so now out of all this crap up here what do i want this is interviewed so i'm gonna go with full blitz kit or at least for the gauges blitz water temperature this is all original this is all from japan blitz boost gauge and then i've got a blitz uh what is this exhaust temperature exhaust temp water temp boost hks evc control the turbo that's just the basic one more boost less boost that's it that's all we need for the car i don't want to go crazy i don't want to get too much stuff in the way like having to worry like on the gtr i've got overview settings i've got actuator

(Start: 00:06:23)
settings that i can do all sorts of weird things on and i've actually forgotten everything but yeah i don't want all that stuff i just want on off more boost less boost okay we'll see how we do for space but maybe we'll throw in a turbo time or something in here and there's going to be an aem gauge that i'm likely going to get for air fuel ratio but i think i'm going to put that on the dash so it's nice and visible rather watch air fuel then boost you know sometimes it's just so much easier to just do the work instead of hitting record moving around camera angles all that but i do feel bad for you guys because you're missing out on content so here's that hole that i felt it's just slightly higher than the actual bodywork itself but it's near perfect i'm almost done a little bit more to do a little bit more sand here and then it's it's great then i decided let's do it it's good let's cover up that thing that thing is ugly move over to that pretty sure i said in the lost little portion but fibro gel with hardener

(Start: 00:07:25)
on the aluminium mesh aluminium mesh which goes on the underside and then body filler this is body for little bondo now that is perfect and this one almost there it's like a slight ridge i'm actually so stoked on how hard this is this aluminium mesh coupled with the fibro gel and underneath and the bond on the top strong strong strong if all goes planned i should have that windscreen in by the end of the week hoping that the guys don't screw me around again for like the fourth time we'll see crossing fingers um what else

(Start: 00:08:27)
mr2 is out you guys saw that the mrt is out now so rx-7 sitting in the back anymore we need to go for a drive and then back to this car afterwards i got the front end to finish up quite a lot to go on and still i'm gonna try to pull this section out and uh as you can see bit of a battle the heat and and pulling i mean i could only do so much there's this piece over here that just does not want to bend it's quite thick metal and it's just not going anywhere it's supposed to look like that once that's done i'm just going to do a little bit more panel beading over here at the top and then that i just need to neaten up a little bit just it looks terrible the flaky bits and then mostly it's mostly straight like just there i just need to straighten that piece up it's not gonna take me long to do and then same over here just these little edges straighten that up i mean that's that's quick quick quick stuff

(Start: 00:09:28)
a pair of flat pliers easy getting there fortunately it was just the side that was really mangled other side of the car near perfect because the bottom was fun so the impact was on this side and it hit quite hard over here and it broke there only the rest of the side is perfect it was just the radiator support that got messed up and then a little bit where the light goes i've just been bending about i need to push it up a little bit more outwards subframe everything the cross members everything is okay it's not bad it's not straight there's no crumble points there's no creasing on the on the a-frames i mean there was a little bit of rust but look how generally you'd have like this whole section being broken and cracked around here there's like pressure points over here nothing everything's fine no issues anywhere nothing on that side either

(Start: 00:10:31)
but it was enough impact for passenger bump uh what he called airbag and steering wheel airbags go off and then i was told that it rolled down the bank and uh it crashed into a gate but could roll down the bank crashed to the gate i don't know don't your airbags go off and need pressure on the seat for them to actually go off also doesn't the car need to be on i don't know after that all i know is it's set in mafikang for a very long time gathering red dust rear seats are semi-clean i still spend a little bit more time but they've been disinfected over dettol or savalon whichever one of the two that i used so it smells a lot better it doesn't smell like rappers anymore it smells like a hospital now that's it for the video thank you so much for the support as of late you guys are awesome uh lots of support on my other platforms too tik tok instagram etc that's it we'll see you in

(Start: 00:11:31)
a few days cheers boys

Title: Skyline Owner's Need To Know This! People's Skyline Get's new mods and R33 work!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wfiihqNx5g

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome to a brand new video lots of exciting stuff happening on the skylines today both the gtr and the r33 the gtr received an early birthday present birthday present for me from my wife and it's it's cool um i haven't done anything to the car that's really been aesthetic uh for a couple years i mean the last was the plastic dip and then everything else has just been like engine mods and which is also fantastic but but there's something cool i'll take you there now the skyline we're doing a whole bunch of stuff um we're busy panel beading using open flame uh heating things up it's cool lots of metal work i'm learning at the same time so that's that's pretty awesome let's go take a look at the skyline before we go any further this is the secret that every skyline owner needs to know oh so lame i actually only found this

(Start: 00:01:02)
out recently let me show you how because i've owned that for 2013 what's that now so eight years now i've read it for eight years it's the longest i've ever owned a car for and i had no idea it could do that until yesterday and then i made a tick tock video about that and the video has gone viral it had like 77 000 views so anyway how did i figure it out well i was busy working on the on this car here when i took the bumper off the other day it caught on here and this pulled up i was like hey that's pretty cool so i was like okay let me go try it on the r32 and it didn't work i was like what maybe it's a 33 thing anyway look at that found some more rocks damn cars found in and the desert that back so anyway how do i figure it out on the 32 because i've tried everything you can see it right here

(Start: 00:02:03)
there so this was a fixed like that there's a little bit of a  to get it out because i've double sided taped my number plate on here and it's like super strong it hasn't come off in eight years um here's the original color of the car by the way it's silver it's little plastida um one bolt 10 millimeter and came right out i mean i wouldn't recommend driving around like this at all one that's illegal i'd never do that two it just looks weird before i show you the super awesome mod i'm down to names over here so this is the first time i've hit the c panel roof is done dusty uh door is done fender's done i mean nothing else has turned your finger bump up on it all that done other side of the car all the way to c pillar i think so i'm like officially halfway on names anyway

(Start: 00:03:04)
can you guys see the mod already how awesome is that neochrome flip up steering wheel hub thing this is a worx bell actually identical to the nrg ones there are a couple reviews on the internet where guards from from the states where taking the nrg and this one and they're running them side by side and were identical everything was identical matches with my brother again i think it's pretty cool this is what it does how's that epic here uh it's not straight because i parked this way and the steering's locked i don't have the key but it'll probably i'm hoping it'll be straight when i put the key in so this quick release flip up was picked up from fury accessories or fury auto sport there in cape town fantastic service but what is the point of a flip up thing um it's kind of like what the race car guys do i

(Start: 00:04:05)
mean to get in and out like if it's quite tight they flip it up they've got more space to get it this would have been a deal for the rx7 seeming as it's very tight to get in and out of the rx-7 but they didn't have the right hub for an fd i'm going to take you back a couple nights ago we're working on the r33 uh we as an eye and then we'll be back in a over here that i'm busy working through i'm going to take these fenders off because i want to pull this wiring through and then at some stage tonight maybe another night we're going to get a nice car [Music] clean up all the crap we're going to rust proof it and then move on and i want to start straightening some of these things so i've got a heat torch gun thing um you'll see just now keep this up start bending things back into the right place [Music]

(Start: 00:05:50)
see what i mean i think this would have been almost impossible to sort out whilst it was on the car [Music] find myself a nice little city onto the top of the sway bar [Music] spread [Music]

(Start: 00:06:59)
y'all know what i'm doing here rust treatment brew rust love this rust converter [Music] i know you're probably thinking okay well he's chopping and changing he just took the damn wheel off why the hell is he here i took the wheel off because the tires screwed i'm not working on brakes yet i took it off because i need a new 15-inch tire just so it's easy to roll the car in and out because i pump it up it lasts a day i'm just going to pick up one of these like uh pre pre-owned reused ones like 100 bucks in a story and we're back there's been some substantial changes very cool stuff how's this radiator support is pretty much straight i've been bashing and banging what you saw in the video it was like

(Start: 00:08:02)
not even the tip of the iceberg when i came to see the paddle beating stuff i didn't want to make a lot of noise with the with the hammers and beating and i also didn't have my flame which i do have today and a few days ago when i was actually doing work so i'm just using one of these pretty simple so this section over here i'll end up doing beating at this this was like badly granted it was all twisted back up radio support it was quite funny my my parents came here for an outdoor visit we stayed in the house they stayed outdoors we were all masked up and we're just talking through the sliding door my old man gets bored very quickly um especially since like yeah you know the kids are screaming on the inside he can't hear them my mom's talking to them so he got bored so i gave him hammers i gave him the torch and i gave him the radiator support and he just sat outside banging away so he managed to straighten this up um it was a little bit flared here still

(Start: 00:09:03)
which i sorted out and then it wasn't correct with the angle because he didn't yeah have a lot of time in the garage he was actually working out so i didn't have a lot of time in the garage to actually fit it so what i did is i'll end up cutting it here because it was badly bent here and cut it up fixed the angles fixed the bend that's just to hold it in place so this is kind of right now this needs to be welded on and my bends are pretty much right this needs to be slightly straightened bent out this is too much bend that way it needs to be knocked in a little bit uh radio support does need a little bit of persuasion here and there it's not 100 straight this side it's very good on that side this belongs to the arthur dtg2 but i've got a new one in there just using this as a kind of mock for it and then let me fix this at the bottom

(Start: 00:10:03)
and then this and then i'm done you know once you start throwing some some fabulous paste on it which i have over here and this little this is body filler okay so old man had like a kg of each one and then this is called fibro gel it's stinks so it's it's very very strong this fibro gel

(Start: 00:11:07)
the last thing i want to show you guys is all these little holes i'm not going to be doing a shave i don't know if i mentioned the last video it's been like a week i'm going to do like a half shave so i'm going to get rid of the seam sealer it seems pretty easy to do and then i'm going to get rid of a bunch of holes i'm not going to smooth this out i'm not going to plate this it's i mean yeah stuff like that will come out and these these bolts and that so it's going to look better but it's not going to be smoothed out like some of the cool youtubers out there and anyway i need to just figure out what holes i need which is going to be quite easy because uh the 32 gtr is very similar and then i've also got pictures all over the internet everybody's a picture of the logo of engine bay is what other guys do so since i don't have a welder and since this is just race car not anything other than the race car i've got this uh can you see that okay on the camera

(Start: 00:12:09)
it's aluminium mesh okay so this is going to go on the underside and i'm going to put in some fiberglass  so it's really really strong fiberglass putty and then on the top i'm going to use the bondo smooth it out shape it obviously underneath i'll make it look neat too uh but yeah that is the plan uh usually guys what they do is there they'll plate and they'll weld but some people do what i do too so i don't know i don't have a welder yet i don't know how to weld it's going to take some time i want to get this thing going i want to start sorting this out or between det getting it in here uh bonnet i don't know some guy was selling a bonnet on on facebook marketplace i'm thinking about picking it up because this one's pretty screwed i don't think i'm gonna have much luck bending it back in shape my fenders are okay they're workable and then i have somebody that wanted to sponsor bumper bonner fenders

(Start: 00:13:10)
but that's gone dead in the water side mirror i've got another one on the way and we just need to start putting interior back together i want to redo the dash quite a lot of work to be done still but anyway i'm glad you guys are here uh underneath of the car i'm gonna be pushing it out in the next day or two and then we'll be filming again spraying underneath the car and then cleaning up i've dropped the car back on the ground it's a long story i was going to do a complaint video but i'll just wait on that i was supposed to have the glass installed yesterday i want to see what the outcome is and then we'll chat about it if there is an issue all that being said thank you so much for the support in the video i appreciate it and for all the new subscribers probably should have started this my name is nelson i run this jdm channel i have five i got five jdm cars that are mostly in pieces or at least this one's in pieces the mr2 and the black armor or x7 are like hundreds silver one needs sort of the feeling gtr one or two more things

(Start: 00:14:11)
and then this one lots of things thank you so much for watching appreciate it i'll see you all next one peace

Title: Abandoned Skyline R33 - Taillight removal and MORE!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nmiqvrKlEY

(Start: 00:00:00)
hello and welcome to the vlog uh look like a hobo i haven't shaved my hair's a mess i don't sound right can you guys hear that i've been sick my daughter's been sick my son everybody's been sick it's been crazy at home i'm still like um i'm not 100 i'm like 85 but i'm good um that's partly why the reason why i haven't been uploading um i actually did film something just before getting sick but i haven't had a chance to edit it anyway this is going to be one of those vlogs we are moving around so i don't even know what the title of the video is going to be but i haven't started the rx-7 in a little while and we did those changes like four videos ago which was what i do i did boost controller i put the hks ebc5 in and apexi plug leads we took the old leads out those ones over there above the turbo

(Start: 00:01:03)
and then i couldn't test it because it was just a little bit too late and my kids were sleeping and blah blah blah anyway yeah we're gonna start it up now this reminds me three boxes what does that mean it says car saws customs on the top that means some stuff you have there's one and then this stuff excuse the mess haven't been in here actually i haven't been in here in over a week it's dusty it's bad i just dropped the stuff in here today um i'm selling all these things so if you guys want to see the process they're all on instagram all of this is available i've taken away what's not i had some cool evos evo 7s two of them this is actually pretty cool this is a toyota mystery car real x inside here it could either be an ea an ae86 a supra or a 2000 gt right you get the idea that's pretty cool but what's actually

(Start: 00:02:04)
in here because i have open it is an ae86 another one there another one there the one that's in there is a lot cooler these are actually all pullback cars just by the way yep all of them pull back cars except for this fuel truck if you guys want to buy these the dvds up i had some option dvds those are all gone sold and then this came in the package too so i killed two birds this is for you guessed it the r33 there's another one on the way let's start it up are you kidding wrong keys that's a spare key for the black fd which is on the wrong side this is actually for the gtr i'm still sick i'm picking up wrong keys

(Start: 00:03:04)
[Music] [Music] i'm gonna give away all my trade secrets here but stay yes it's all messed up the paint's messed on your respray this is actually from an s14 so funny enough the s14 side mirror fits in the r33 vice versa uh now here's the best part i'm giving away my secrets these mirrors are super cheap okay especially this one because this one was broken this one was like a hundred round plus minus it's got the wiring i'm hoping the wiring is the same i'm pretty

(Start: 00:04:05)
sure it is um it's missing an actual mirror part that's not a train smash and yeah that's broken anyway this is from the s13 the price difference is insane because of jdm tax the price difference right now you're looking at about eight plus six to eight thousand round for a set of these and about two and a half to five for a single one because of jdm tax ridiculous this was super cheap you can pick up s14 ones for like five hundred round plus minus for one a set about a thousand to two thousand rand they're cheap okay um how does this work this will need a thick on top this go on top of this plastic

(Start: 00:05:06)
okay yes it does and actually it holds it i got some rust here i need to try and somehow get out to midas because this is it i'm empty because there's nothing my disturbing north they sell this my mate gary offered to pick up a bottle and drop it off of my first box and i just pay him eft and i was like nah don't worry i'm going to be going there soon but uh i haven't left the house in a while [Music] okay that's it let it sit for a little while [Music]

(Start: 00:06:11)
i gotta fast forward here three weeks um i haven't filmed i haven't picked up the camera i haven't done anything i think i did mention this in the video that i haven't edited yet so i don't actually remember um my daughter's been sick my son's not sick and he was sick for two weeks we had to go to pee twice finally put him on antibiotics they said it was viral initially then it wasn't viral then it was bacterial antibiotics haven't been sleeping properly um i've been a wreck work's been demanding too so i'm working on the car now prepping now okay for real we're doing stuff for real now [Music]

(Start: 00:07:25)
[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we done it's safe i can shake it it's not falling just thinking about things rationally here um if i go work underneath the car i'm going to take a long time that means this video is

(Start: 00:08:25)
going to be very very long and probably boring so here's the plan since i haven't been working on the cough for so long i'm going to ease into things and i'm going to try to get the tail lights out now it's had some trouble getting these out i've gotten all the screws out i've done this before i've done this on subarus all sorts of cars well actually just subarus uh but a lot of them it's not budging so i read it on some forums and apparently there's some hectic glue on the back if it's never been taken out it's a to take out one way you can do it is with a hairdryer or heat gun i don't have a heat gun so hair dryers uh

(Start: 00:09:34)
oh sure okay so what's this black okay there already was a crack here i'll just kind of made it a little bit worse i think i can't fix that it's stuff i'm glad this has come out oh beautiful so if you're wondering how to actually remove these at the back it's pretty simple there's just a bunch of nuts here one two three four five there's five of them remove the five nuts put heat pull this baby out you gotta put a little bit of force on it i'm gonna try now without heating it up and it's virtually impossible you gotta heat it up

(Start: 00:10:58)
hmm so so [Music] yuck that is pretty gross

(Start: 00:12:22)
so [Music] [Applause] so [Music] okay good thing i'm doing this i found a bunch of rust a little bit of rust here mostly where the the bolt holes are and then there's like strange little slices if you can see

(Start: 00:13:25)
that little rust spots little looks like little cuts i mean like what color i mean this headlight i'm pretty sure this headlight has never come off some rust over here we know what to do brew rust new bottle let's go and this stuff is flipping magic check this out i mean you've probably seen this like 30 times in the channel already just tried cleaning this with a cloth and a bit of water i'm just i'm worried

(Start: 00:14:26)
that i'm going to put too much water and it goes inside the lenses so i found a whole bunch of these mounting screws and i'm assuming that this section here comes off so [Music] looks like it one two three oh god

(Start: 00:15:28)
[Music] so had a little bit of drama remember that crack that was up to about here well the whole thing just snapped into pieces uh there was actually a crack at the bottom too and i didn't notice that so i filled it up with some q bond filling and reinforcement gray it's holding pretty strong i just need to make up a section i've got to build that piece up and then fill this i've got some proper filling patty fillets and it will be fine i'm actually not even worried plus i've seen these in japan uh a little bit pricey now obviously with the old jdm text thing [Music]

(Start: 00:16:48)
uh cast double check look at that oh my gosh look at this one all right i'm gonna i'm gonna call it at least call it for the camera because it's just going to be boring content watching me clean stuff but the good news is the car's in the garage which means i can work nights now because working outside with no cover when it's winter need a lot of jew and all that crap you get sick so thankfully the car is in now fantastic and it's also a safety issue me working outside i can't put the beams on and all that so rubbers could come whatever it's in content coming thank you so much for watching see you all next one

Title: JDM CARS FOR SALE IN SA | RX7 | S2000 | Skyline's and MORE!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOgWuEflLgM

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome to a brand new episode of jdm cars for sale in south africa we're currently at the end of may 2021 and i have found a bunch of jdm cars that i'm going to be rating some of them are good some of them are bad some may be project cars i might crack a few jokes here and then give a few bad ratings but everything is satire don't take it personally if you are the owner let's jump right into it so the first one is this mazda rx-7fb it doesn't have a rotary which could possibly make it a little bit more reliable because that is the running joke on the internet donate on me uh fb f e turbo engine so that came off another mazda i don't know much about that engine at all interior looks okay there's just a bunch of wiring hanging there the steering wheel is cooked like you could probably pick up china wall steering because probably didn't come from charimal that's why it is cooked but you could probably pick up a new one from china more just replace it and the value of the card got up by 1 000

(Start: 00:01:02)
i'm just talking crap uh there's the engine it's a mazda engine i don't know anything about it i don't know what card came out of who knows it looks pretty cool looks like a decent conversion it's probably pretty quick he's making 200 kilowatts at 0.7 by that that's not a lot of boost but there is a lot of power for that much boost which is pretty cool to see so this particular car uh bonnet's mismatched it is a project at the end of the day colors off a little bit wheels i don't know i don't particularly like the whole black on polished but that's just me uh steering wheel door cards you know it needs a little bit of work not a lot just a little bit and it could be decent so i'm going to give this car a oh i was going to say five i'm gonna say six i'm being generous here it's even got an alarm system speaker thing then for the honda guys we have this honda prelude it's the fourth generation the only reason i know it's a fourth generation is because

(Start: 00:02:02)
it's 4g here 2.2 vtec i don't know it's got a red and silver engine the hospital engine this is ka-22 so leather seats it is manual and i believe they're pretty hard to combine manual form especially here in south africa it's on stock wheels it's got stock exhaust i don't think so just the tips have been changed possibly stock radiator pops are not stock and that's just been painted and it's got an air intake filter yeah uh that being said 36 grand i guess it's good for this car i mean it's it's not a bad looking car there's front wheel drive i think pretty sure it's front wheel drive i don't know much about these cars i know nsx i'm learning i'm learning i'm learning i'm going to give this a 5 out of 10. again for the honda boys you guys keep asking me for honda s2000 well i found

(Start: 00:03:04)
more than one actually but i've only listed one in this video other one was really expensive this is going at 300k uh no swaps 110 000 kilometers and it's got narrow wides newly done leather and he's got a joint problem he struggles to get in and out of the car it looks like it's in really good condition like you said the leather got redone that's pretty cool that's not stock that's cool is it a vortex supercharger 2006 model with supercharger did it come stock soup i don't think so it didn't didn't come stuck with the supercharger this must be quick they're very very fast with the with supercharger on them i like the delivery redone i think the price is okay give this a seven out of ten

(Start: 00:04:06)
here's a true project car there's no papers it's toyota silica it's st 182 so it's the front wheel drive version that's got a 3s ge in it not all that bad of an engine i've got the same one my mrt sw20 is still fun car however this is front wheel drive the file speed apparently it swings but it's yeah i'm not starting up electronics are working body paint fading you can see that much so you want seventeen grand but then this is fifteen five hundred you could probably get them down to twelve because there's not many papers and they're not worth anything at all because it's just the model that nobody cared about nobody wanted there's a 3s ge stock air box everything's stuck 202 000 k's [Music] i don't know manual five out of ten ew what happened here funny it's got gp plates on it

(Start: 00:05:07)
it's got no papers maybe it is on the native system you never know maybe you had a luck another silica gta 7th generation there's not a lot of info on this ad other than partial original need for speed underground 2 wrap yeah it's botswana registered so that's unfortunate but it is here 65 grand a bit of an ask remember i'm not looking for the best of the best jdm cars yet i'm looking for all of them and this is one of them that's here it's not registered it's sad but anyway i don't particularly like this one anyway some people do some people don't but it is exactly what he said need to speed underground two it was heavily involved in that game i'll give this a 5 out of 10. and then we've got this gts r32 gtr so the gts model was non-turbo and this one has an rp25 so it

(Start: 00:06:08)
originally came with an rb20e custom intake rb25 never came in this car just by the way this was either the what do you call it rb20e or rb20det which is what i've got in the garrosh this one however comes with three rb-25 model motors including parts larson's up-to-date essay ridge no time wasters it looks good remember it is not a gtr okay so all these badges they mean nothing the price tag i don't know it's market related the prices are so inflated at the moment it's ridiculous like my gtr if i had to sell it i could sell it for 600k if someone had to buy it for 600k well then they bought it for 69k but i could put it up on the market because that's what the prices are going for right now and it's crazy money and the same with the gtsts etc they're going for around this price if those cars running well and all that

(Start: 00:07:09)
sort of stuff whatever if if someone is looking for a gtst in particular this might not be the right car this is a gts model but with a few subtle changes i mean the bonnet looks like it's already been cut so let's see there we go so it's got the gtr style bonnet the front bumper is like weird side skirts are weird and then the back just looks dead it's got bonnet lifters there for heat displacement and a big ass wang gang 350k i think it's a steep ask especially that's got blue neons underneath um i don't know everything's so inflated right now the jdm i mean you could have picked this car up for let's say in 2013 for probably like 55 to 70 000 round actually probably less than that anyway it is what it is uh prices are mental all of my cars are just crazy um

(Start: 00:08:12)
i like this car i just don't like the price um we're gonna go for a six out of ten then there's 350z no information just dm me so it's a pretty shitty ad big turbo and look at that rb25 big intake plenum looks clean i like the bonnet it's got some gauges that's different i guess manual which is great i like the wheels yeah i don't know smoky smoky i'm gonna assume this was a cold rainy day and that's what smoking but anyway rb25 that's so blurry let's assume these are horsepower figures it is a big ass turbo though i don't know 465 kilowatts it does that sound legitimate i don't know maybe not anyway

(Start: 00:09:13)
really crap just dm me okay six out of ten i don't remember if this was on the channel because i was looking at it and it's also expensive it's a gts again this is exactly the same call that i have outside my r33 gts except this one's got an ib25 in it and obviously it's a lot better condition because mine's bashed and crashed and all that stuff even the interior is a lot better sparkle wheel he's got that little drift knobby i don't know what that is weird jvc cd player from japan ashtray oh i'm missing that i need to get that it's a nice thing a dash that's actually complete he's got a gtr cluster which is pretty mad 300 k power oh he's got the nismo cluster that's mad because this cosmos beacon registered but it ain't no gtr

(Start: 00:10:16)
got an original garrett turbo look i like this but unfortunately it'll just be a drift car so i gotta i gotta go i like this car there wasn't beacon registered seven out of ten then we've got this rx7 with this weird body kit in it it's got like a wide body top thing ew with a sticker bombed no okay that is a big engine it's a lexus v8 what everybody says but yeah it's a one used engine yes we know it's an rx7 automatic roll the dice man 100 grand for this thing i don't know probably not my cup of tea whatever six out of ten for this got a spitronix ecu six out of ten we've got this rx-8 uh i don't often have rx8 on here

(Start: 00:11:18)
but i think there are two that i'm about to show i don't actually remember but the price was good 75 000 is another one for 65 000 somewhere i may be showing it or not i actually don't remember i've had this list of cars open for the last four days my daughter's been sick it's been mentally i'm trying to look after the baby and work and she's anyway so i haven't had a chance to film this i've been playing on filming this for four days it's an rx8 it's still got the rotary high performance variant and he's looking for a bucky and the car is sa registered which is cool give you a 6 out of 10 and then we've got this evo 4 and it's got a brand new motor at swazi ridge unfortunately and it's got a gt35 turbo with a small housing so it must spooled pretty quick 240 kilowatts and 0.7 baht so this car was making more power than that other car that had what was it also 0.7 200 kilowatts

(Start: 00:12:19)
that's pretty cool to see the difference here mitsubishi evo for if it was sa region at this price that would be like jump on it so quickly but it's not and it's super unfortunate to see that ford g63 turbo it's got an intake it's got possibly six boost manifold he's got reflector stuff here for heat management and stock seats colors color is not my taste anyway great car unfortunate that is not yeah so i'm just gonna go for a six out of ten forgot about this people got angry with me about this so i posted an ad on my instagram like two weeks ago and i said lady owned perfect condition

(Start: 00:13:20)
or something like that requires little tlc um 3800 and then i waited like three minutes maybe four minutes and then i post on those as they got you by then i already had like four or five dms send me pics do whatever i'm like guys it's a joke check my next story um one day you're really angry with me anyway this thing is riddled with rust it's not just surface road it looks pretty bad there's a hay coming out of it hey [Music] i think this is this is at the end to be honest got three headlights okay front bumper extra boot and one door extra look cooler coming with extras and the price like damn damn cheap you could definitely part it out and make your money back and more sell the side mirrors

(Start: 00:14:24)
all the lights but again this car could be could be registered i mean possibly registered there's there's nothing on here it says no papers but then i see it's got in pumalango on the back maybe that's not that looks a bit weird anyway um shitty ad and i'm sorry to the people that i feel about putting this ad on instagram so i'm just gonna go for four to ten i told you it was another exact sixty five thousand round i was actually looking at those not to buy but just looking at it it's in completely stock form it's missing those little front reflector thingies you could probably pick those up anyway 89 000 kilometers 88 on add [Music] cheap if you ask me price is not negotiable i'm pretty sure

(Start: 00:15:26)
if you're selling your car there must be slight room you could possibly take 64. uh i like the price seven out of ten and then we got this toyota super market iii it's missing a front bumper i'm not sure what the story was there but it is registered in north west province and one strip two jz round bearings one complete 1jz available 2jz turbo engine sold so it looks like you get these two engines but not this one it had that one in it guys got a porsche it's also a porsche in the background it's a bit higher considering that there's like no engine but the car looks very very neat and i'm really wondering where the hell is the bumper that doesn't tell you anything about the bumper um i would bring them down a lot less and i'm going to give this out a 5 out of 10. and then we have a power spirit server that i was looking at and that shouldn't be part of this video

(Start: 00:16:27)
and then i found it to yoda lexus okay this car is essay registered which is cool and when it says toyota lexus it's actually just a lexus uh it would be a toyota altezza if it was in japan well this is the lexus is 200 30 grand it's got a computer box problem allegedly okay 30 grand the guy's ready to talk so the price is negotiable it's got a one g something engine okay so it's a two liter inline six normally aspirated they're pretty capable engines you could do a few mods and breathing and all that sort of stuff and they actually do go why i'm saying this is a decent buy is that well one there'll always be a project called is200 will be a project car it's old and needs attention and all of that 30 grand super good price it's manual you're not going to go wrong with it even if there's something wrong with the engine

(Start: 00:17:27)
this is the right base to well throw in a 2j or throw in an rb or whatever maybe and he's ready to talk i like this a lot 30 grand could come down to 24 possibly seven out of ten and then we got another lexus this is the vrp shift ls 400 v8 996 model so it's it's old but you know the tech would still likely work because they built this is a high-end vehicle and generally the high-end models this stuff is built really well to last i'm just talking about my own experience anyway uh papers on order price negotiable and if if you only need engine gearbox and computer 28 900 bring your own mechanic to take it out okay so he'll sell the car

(Start: 00:18:29)
for 15 000 round with no engine gearbox and computer but does this have registered this could be cool it looks pretty neat and it could be turned into vrp build there's only three pictures unfortunate six out of ten for this guy and then now look at this i generally wouldn't show this so this is the next nissan maxima 1993 it's got no papers and engine overhaul whatever but look at this look at the styling yeah so the maxima was the ls series competitor toyota's etcetera competitor dude likes his fans and he likes his overalls he likes orange stuff um that's horrid terrific but anyway it is what it is i just want to show you guys the styling of the time they they're both very close and yeah model 1983 1996 and then we got this 300 zx which i

(Start: 00:19:31)
believe is super cheap but it's unfortunate again there are no papers it has a gp what do you call it number plate but there's no papers ideal race car i don't know if it's registered or what but yeah this car is probably something that you could use for the track this would be a tracker i'll give this a 5 out of 10. and then for your miata boys this one's sitting in benoni 60 000 it's already been turbocharged which you know a lot of people buying these cars two turbocharged so might as well pick up this one's really good all the work uh full nb kit front lip side skirt rear wing euler racing wheels uh fresh front tires paper you can order get rid of a few of my cars i'd love to know what other cars you have so i don't know it looks it looks cool does the bond actually close could just be the headlights they need

(Start: 00:20:33)
to be readjusted that looks like it's sitting very high maybe wrong that sting was disgusting dude's got a mask which is good speakers are horrific the pedal covers are horrific i don't know a lot of will change um cool i guess let's go for a six out of 10 with this one and then we've got this one um there's two actually so two 450 k there's any one that's showing in the ad here i actually saw a video of this particular car running and it didn't sound too great um i might be wrong i mean you guys need to go check it out hadn't been started in a while doodle's making it blunt it was uh yeah uh anyway it's got like a v mounted top uh radiator in the front or intercooler that's in

(Start: 00:21:34)
my bed i'm assuming the radiator is somewhere here and he's got two and one is driving one is not and one is twin turbo music gearbox injectors i guess for the price and if there's two possibly a good deal i don't know a lot about this ad i did see that video but then i didn't get it involved much six out of ten again for your honda boys 140k you're gonna be asking what this dude is mad however it's stock stock wheels stock paint work look how clean this is this is tommy iffy aspect right honda vtec untouched stock airbox mint mint mint not sure on the mileage you need to what's up with this guy and it's a honda vtec so it's blood for vtec super rare it's in durban i don't know anything about this

(Start: 00:22:35)
140 grand but it gets your time machines back tommy fbs back whatever probably not his honda vtec 8 out of 10 i can't believe this i'm giving a honda an 8 out of 10. that's not an nsx and then we've got this uh 140y it's not really jdm well neither was that honda and a couple other jdm is an rx7 fd3s and an r32 gtr r33 gtr those are real jdm a super impressive wrx sdr that's japanese because likely it was an australian import so ozdm or ukdm built there etc etc but anyway i just wanted to show you guys this because well it's pretty common to see this in durban oh look it's in phoenix it's free go jump on it somebody will buy this it's free don't buy it just take it free uh the subaru has been for sale before i'm not giving a rating on it because it's been on the channel but

(Start: 00:23:36)
it's had a price drop so he was initially asking i think 85 or 90k and he's dropped the price so now it's 70k you probably go down or near his cap cash upper c go 60k no no what you call it on the corner rating on the car the next one is two r32 one is a blue gtst the other one is a yellow gtst they are both not sa registered dude once i forgot the pricing i think he wanted 270k and 350k respectively somebody else told me this i get pinged and guys go ahead please do it if you find a car for sale i might not have time to reply i'll like it uh but send it to me and uh someone told me the price of these cars or allegedly what they got one for them and like and 350k but the con register that's a lot of money to ask the four door though looks so cool

(Start: 00:24:37)
imagine you could essay registers that'll be the sick daily driver done deal pity two cars both on this area just a five out of ten and then we've got two cars left both of skylines this one i'm just bringing it up because it's funny it's an imported car so this is not like an r34 or whatever it's that other g35 spec but the guy is advertising it with the pictures of the vehicle at the crash scene or the excellent scene and it's blurry so he was like running while he's taking the photos like hey let me just edit those now let's leave the card inside right cool uh bringing that up because it's funny i don't know if it's even worth it moving right on swiftly on i'm only giving this a ready moving on to something that i actually was interested in not that i'll be able to buy it right now because i'm brokers anyway this r33 gtst is for sale it looks beautiful had a lot of views on

(Start: 00:25:40)
this page 2100 views already that logo doesn't suit the car and i just noticed now i think that headlight cover like the yeah i think it looks broken anyway it's sitting on stock wheels it's a five stud which means it's a gtst it's a true gst gtsd it's got the red badging monster the blue badging which means the non turbo got the bumper yep b is missing the headlight things no this is a series one just by the way 136k on the clock 95 the issue with this car it's not a sewerage and that sucks and it hurts a lot because i'd love to see this car driving on the road legally properly all that it's got an rb25 in the car nice engine aftermarket park work and an intake still got the math and

(Start: 00:26:41)
strap brace i like it but sadly conrad just this car unless you know somebody who knows somebody who's willing to take a bribe and i don't know that person so at the end of the day those all the jdm cars that have been for sale in may 2021 hope you enjoyed the video thank you so much for the support please like the video comment on the video it really helps that they'll get rid of them they'll go through the room i'm trying to push again i'm making a comeback pushing on we're at 7072 subscribers as of recording this video thank you so much for the support i really appreciate it i'll see you in the next one peace you

(Start: 00:08:22)
or most most of you guys said do the brakes and then all of a sudden i went to the back seats i did the back seats because the car smelled of rat piss and i wasn't sure why and i thought it was that mould that was on the seat and then i found all that stuff i'm not going to do the roof liner and and all the other jazz at the moment i'm not going to touch the interior for a little while now obviously i'm going to clean that back seat still i haven't been it's been raining so yeah okay so what's next to the car next is put the car on jack stands lift it high up clean up all that red mud on the underside sort it all out see if i can find rust spots cover the rust spots of that brew rust uh rust killer corrosion anti-corrosion story um our coilovers arriving for the car uh i need to make a big video on that one that'll come up i'm not gonna mention anything right now some of you guys already know and i don't know other stuff that needs to happen on the car lots of stuff and then i need to get cracking on this rb20 det not the crappy rb20 i did some stuff and i mean i pulled off all the alternators and alternator and power

Title: PROJECT R33 - Attempted Interior
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlYJrKS72dE

(Start: 00:00:00)
hello and welcome to the channel bright and early on a sunday morning actually chilly sunday morning we're going to be working on the r33 project car i'm going to be fitting the interior today hopefully get it all buckled down and in first we're going to clean it up but before i do any of that i'm gonna go fetch the black rx-7 let's go so nice to have a running driving nothing to worry about rx7 completely stock standard you guys know this car this is uh this was my first rx7 the one i bought bum stick before i got to silver so it's been sitting at my parents place because i've

(Start: 00:01:00)
well i'm battling with space here i'm battling with turning space so i figured i'd rather have it here outside than park outside there because at least i can maintain it and put covers on here i can at least wash it because i'm just pretty much not leaving the house at the moment so so beard with my turning space i'm gonna make a plan rx-7's back i'm gonna do a little bit of driving stuff with this in the mr2 suit how's this this dehumidifier moisture absorber has been on the car for about three weeks plus minus it's full that was because there was no glass how disgusting is it oh my god [Music] just want to put that in a sandwich

(Start: 00:02:26)
i think i should um take this whole back seat assembly out actually you know what i am going to do not now we're going to focus on the dash i just want to clean this car but i don't want to breathe this [Music] crap [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:03:30)
be did you know this is the first time i'm sitting in the seat and i've had the car for two months i've been sitting because that mold everywhere i mean i didn't exactly clean it properly i just vacuumed it but i don't know what it was it's going to be a bit of a slow process because i do want to clean things up nicely underneath the dash so obviously this is the rust converter this is the treatment which by the by the brew rust my dad found out where they sell it yes there's a number on the back here which i found was mr a m maharaj i called this last week when one of you guys asked me where this product from i called this number and it didn't even ring i just went dead i tried phoning it twice and then my dad phoned this weekend and and it rang and he picked up the phone

(Start: 00:04:32)
they sell this brew rust you cannot find it anywhere online i've looked everywhere but they sell brew rust at durban north marker on the rocks drive i forgot the price it's under 100 bucks though for a bottle that'll sort out a lot of the car i mean i had probably about this much in the bottle when my dad gave it to me and it's done the bonnet it's done fenders underneath inside the front end of the car and this pretty good oh and also thanks to aaron 802 garage from all the way from vermont in the united states he dropped quite the extensive comment on um russ converters and what what he uses specifically because he's got a whole host of cars you guys should go check out his channel he probably have already is like superstar compared to me he uses rustoleum rust reformer it comes in a spray form in south africa

(Start: 00:05:33)
so spray can aerosol pretty cool and then there's another one that uses permatex but i see that's not available here in south africa so i guess if you are watching from this side of the world brew rust looks like markers have it i don't know if it's just urban north market but maybe i should ask mr maharaj if he wants to to make me a brand ambassador and sponsor me just dip the whole car in brew rust apparently what uh aaron was saying is that there's a specific ingredient which i forgot already and i don't have my phone with me but there's a specific ingredient that all these products have in them that sorts out the rust i forgot the technical term as well i'm just saying it it's what's up that's what it does to me

(Start: 00:06:35)
[Music] so [Music] [Music] oh that's not coming off easily but i remembered something aaron edugarod mentioned something i'll be right back have you said something like clean your car like as if it's your kitchen or something yeah [Music]

(Start: 00:07:36)
no i didn't think of this ship the other day i was just grinding with a cloth [Music] oh that is so much better you wouldn't believe what i did with cam the that was coming out of the bottom my god moving on oh i see some rust there's some rust

(Start: 00:08:41)
[Music] let it soak for a while [Music] check this out i'm so impressed with the doors solid solid solid even when it opens oh it got dirty again how's that mad mad mad mad

(Start: 00:09:46)
not a lot of people see it my wife don't see it she sees a piece of scrap metal i'll see potential [Music] feet [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:10:53)
[Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:11:56)
i know i said in the last video but it's really starting to look like a skyline now here comes the face here [Music] remember i'm going to be redoing this if you guys are just tuning in and you're new to the channel this is my first attempt at recovering a dash it didn't come out what i expected i'm gonna be redoing it it was a learning experience i'm sorry about the static camera angle but there's not much i can do here cameras inside the car if you're wondering easiest way label all your packets keep all your screws inside the dash cluster

(Start: 00:12:57)
[Music] surround [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:15:09)
okay i'm pretty stoked on the temporary outcome it's uh you know i could have done a better job i'm a bit bleak that doesn't take the time to actually get this thing right so like here i needed a bit more filler foam and i didn't do that properly uh i didn't get the stuff pressed down properly here my edges were a little bit off over there it's a bloody shambles um yeah you know i ran out of time i explained that a couple of videos ago shouldn't have done this with the baby being so young when it was happening because i had to run in and out the house and blah blah blah and this thing was just an absolute cock-up steering wheel was okay i mean this thing was hugely exploded i could have probably fixed that up a little bit but for the most part it's all right that's also temporary i'm going to throw in a momo or sparkle or i don't know personal will something decent uh fascia i'm actually not so happy with with the lighting you can still see the imperfections see that where the sun's shining

(Start: 00:16:11)
look from here that's fine if i'm sitting here it's okay so i think that's going to come out again and i'm going to hit all that vht stuff the hammered hammered paint didn't exactly do what i wanted to do anyways looking better i've got a few more things that i need to throw on and then i think we're going to start doing some gauges something cool here i'll i've got an idea of what i want to throw on there and then this is what i've got lined up and i want you guys to tell me in the comments section what i should do for the next video so either back seats are going to come out roof lining is going to come out carpet is going to come out i want to get black dye and i want to redo the carpets and i want to redo the roof lining in full black including all this stuff here okay i need to put those things back there's a pillar mounts covers and then obviously the back seats i want to i want to steam clean and all that jazz i need to clean up a little back panels

(Start: 00:17:12)
and all that so either i'll do that in the next video or put the constants so lift it put it on stands get the wheels off take the brake assembly off on all four so calipers off get the discs off to my dad before they rust up anymore he's a fitter and turner and does a whole bunch of other cool stuff uh get him to skim the discs for me and balance i don't know skim but whatever redo the discs he's on before the rx7 and some other car and he's just crazy good at doing it so get him to do that paint the calipers and then while the wheels are off somehow try and sell these wheels plus the black ones that i have that used to be on the mr2 the 15s and try organize 17 there's a company called hannaford tired of tires they're in phoenix in durban they do trade-ins on wheels i don't know maybe they can trade in eight tires

(Start: 00:18:14)
and wheels okay one tire is flat but seven tires and wheels for one set of 17 so with no tires but i've got tires i wear lots of 17 tires lots of two four fives and lots of two three fives that's the plan let me know in the comment section what do you guys want to see should i finish the interior by doing the roof lining all that stuff or should i lift the car start looking underneath oh and while the car is lifted i want to sort out things underneath the rust protection it's still full of mud red mud uh should i do that or should i finish off the interior let me know thanks so much for watching uh pretty cool video i had some good time with the car hope you guys enjoyed it long one like you requested show you what you're doing diy blah blah blah don't hate on the dash thank you see y'all next one peace

Title: What JDM Cars Can You Import Into South Africa?
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ4ynuJb22Y

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] what's going on guys and welcome to a brand new video i get asked one question so many times a month and that is what cars can you import into south africa i'm going to tell you right now now before i tell you what cars you can import in south africa you need to know one thing we have itec itec is the governing body that allows what you can import and what you can't import they also deal with exports out of the country but we don't care about that right now so basically they have compiled this list that doesn't exist on paper anyway um even if you ask them if let's say an rx-7 is on the list when you know it is on the list they will tell you that they're not sure they'll need to check that if it's on the list please send them specs of the vehicle so itac are very difficult to deal with somehow someone has built a list for them and they just stick to this list and they don't care otherwise i'm busy working on a petition to try and get the f-15 sylvia set up with rtx so that they can allow

(Start: 00:01:00)
us to collect this item because i do believe it is a collector's item and well there's a list of cars that i know are collectible the first being a true japanese supercar rear wheel drive mid engine absolute beast the honda nsx it is the only honda that i know anything about and unfortunately for me it's just a little bit too pricey for it to kind of be in my garage but diving into it the honda nsx i found two examples at the auctions this particular example sold for thirty seven thousand eight hundred and fifty seven us dollars and this one for thirty eight thousand us dollars so i'm gonna tell you now how much that cost to land in south africa so roughly if you had to land one of these bear in mind that this is the automatic model i cannot find a manual one that's sold in the last three months unfortunately this is the only price i have for an automatic and we're estimating or kind of working out on the price of 38 000

(Start: 00:02:01)
this takes into account shipping it takes into account all the fees that are here the fees in japan they do radiation checks in japan they do shaken deregistration fees there's a bunch of fees that you're going to be paying for which is roughly 550 to 700 us dollars in the japanese end and then they're shipping and you know csvs that you've got to pay way bridge data dot etc so i've taken that all into account and i'm just going to give you the numbers going forwards for all the cars now that you understand what sort of costs are involved so if you wanted to bring in this particular automatic honda nsx you'll be looking at 720 000 round landed registered on the road roughly now moving on to a true legend godzilla itself the o32 gtr i own one of these i bought one in 2013 i knew the prices were going up thankfully i bought one unlucky for me i had the option of either getting a 33 or maybe paying a little bit extra and getting a 34 and i thought i'll just get it in the future it'll be fun

(Start: 00:03:01)
and now um yeah it's pretty much unobtainable together 34. so i found two examples at the auction the first being this 1991 grade with 115 000 kilometers it's an rded exterior e interior which means it's not great at all it's below well below average um but yeah anyway you get the idea of the price 23 000 us dollars and then i found this one also similar specs so we're talking cars that are below average here if you want something better you got to pay more than this you're going to pay roughly 28 000 us dollars so we're working on an average of 25 for a car that is below average okay so with regards to pricing i've taken an average of the two so with regards to pricing i've taken an average of the two of all the vehicles that i've found over the last month or two and i've calculated the price which includes and you need to know this the fees in japan so that means procuring the vehicle from an auction

(Start: 00:04:03)
house i'm using japan partners they're based in nagoya let's say the vehicles in yokohama they got to pay for a carrier to get to nagoya for you so you've got to pay for that you've got to do radiation payments radiation checks you got to do a shaken deregistration check so all of that it estimates between 550 to a thousand dollars so i'm just working on a flat rate of 700 for that then you've got to pay for shipping which is row row shipping that i'm calculating all of this on roll on roll off which means the vehicle needs to be in a running condition that's roughly 1300 u.s dollars plus minus and then there's that you got to pay 15 and then there's duties with size which is 25 that you have to pay for vehicle then there's a few small fees which are also included and that's way bridge data dot nr csv is when the car is here in south africa then obviously your cr and licensing that being said taking all of that into account i have worked out an average of all these vehicles

(Start: 00:05:04)
the honda nsx bear in mind this is a fully automatic model i could not find over the last three months a manual version at the auctions yes i know there's retail places that do sell on nsx's and all these other vehicles but i'm particularly looking at the auctions because the pricings are generally better so you're looking at an average working on a rate of 38 000 that this vehicle will be landed for 860 000 round that's registered on the road done now the process that i've worked on average for a gtr r32 that is under average condition the price for this vehicle landed will be a roughly 580 000 ram if you want to get something that's about average spec you're going to be in for about 640

(Start: 00:06:04)
000 rand landed which is expensive these days because the u.s market has driven up the price so much the next one is the r33 which is currently available for import into the united states which means the price has risen quite a bit too i've taken these two vehicles this one has got a bb grading so i mean it's better than average which is great it's also got decent mileage 66 000 kilometers and this one has got 60 000 kilometers with also an average interior and exterior 3.5 overall grading meaning it's above average has some modifications haven't gone through the entire thing yet but it looks like a cool car and the average between these two landed you're looking at 680 000 rand to 700 000 rand landed for an r33 gtr now wrapping up on all the gtr models we're going to take a look at the r34 but before that you have to remember that we are not allowed the gt gts's gts etc these vehicles need to be brought in as a returning resident meaning you have to go work

(Start: 00:07:05)
overseas for 12 months own the vehicle and then you can legally bring back anything as long as the right hand drive if it's left-hand drive what i'm aware of you have to get that car converted but we're not talking about that we're talking about jdm vehicles in particular now the r34 gtr very pricey still the cheapest one i was able to find was ninety thousand ninety seven thousand nine hundred us dollars and then the most expensive was a hundred and twelve thousand us dollars these are base model or v-spec some of them has the base model this one's a v-spec we're not talking nurse specs and all of that these are normal ones that are sold at the auction not retail price i took an average of a hundred and three thousand us dollars calculated landed in south africa you're looking at 2.3 million rand i'm also working on a 15 rand exchange rate because it fluctuates so much um 15 round is just the easiest to do now that we're out of the way with the fire breathing godzilla's let's go look at some tofu

(Start: 00:08:05)
yes you all know what i'm talking about we're talking about the ae86 sprinter trainer now i found two that sold it to auctions over the last two months and the pricing was quite different and that's because of the grading really so the first one i found was 27 000 us dollars 139 000 kilometers very very good for its age 1985 the next one 1980 618 000 us dollars both grading average very good cars i've gone for a price right in the middle and landed this vehicle will see you in that 500 plus minus 1000 round now we all know well because i mentioned in the beginning of the video but the rx-7 fd 3s is eligible for importation as a collector's item and this varies in price range because there are so many variations in specs that most these other guys didn't get when i say other girls i mean other manufacturers didn't apply to their vehicles the rx-7 is a type rs the type r the type rz the touring x the bar thirst

(Start: 00:09:06)
the type rp the list goes on it's crazy so i'm looking at trying to look at base models the first one that i found sold for 9 33 which is very cheap considering what it is 69 000 kilometers and the other one sold for 24 000 us dollars worth 64 000 kilometers so both of them are low mileage this one's a type rx it's a type rs which is actually what i have myself one is a type rs so the value is obviously going to be a lot higher again i just worked in the middle gone are the days the halcyon days are now gone where you would find a vehicle that is cheap like when i bought mine i was picking up the rx7s the black one i'm not going to say the silver ones bro but the black one 2 000 us dollars landed sorry bought it the auctions not landed 90 000 in london and now you cannot find something the same grading as my black one for less than 9000 euros dollars plus minus it's

(Start: 00:10:08)
unbelievable so if you have to work in the middle of these two you're going to be looking at about 360 000 round to 400 000 round importing an rx-7 fd3s in south africa registered on the road which is decent but that also means that our local prices are quite cheap so if you're watching this and you're in the market for an rx-7 i'll go snatch on the ones up that are already up for sale now unfortunately for us there are only three other vehicles that are allowed in south africa's collector's items one of them being the stagia ortek 260 rs i was only able to find one of these for sale and this one sold in april there was nothing else going back three months ago at the auctions it sold for 20 000 us dollars average spec if you don't know what stage it is this basically is a gtr station wagon it has got an rb26 and it's an absolute demon of wagon this one in particular has a whole host of grady gauges which looks

(Start: 00:11:10)
pretty cool stock momo wheel i don't know what else is done to the car it's got some some uh rims on it it's got the stock mats got the stock seats such a cool car anyway 20 000 us dollars would see this vehicle in south africa at 470 000 rand which is actually not so bad considering what you get it's cheaper than the 32g 034 and 33. in the last two vehicles it's really the battle of the rallies it's the subaru versus mitsubishi we only allowed two into the country unfortunately as collectibles the mitsubishi we're allowed the tommy mackinnon edition which is incredibly hard to find at the moment at the auctions nothing is possible in the last three months so what i've done is i've found two evo sixes and the pricing is fifteen thousand us dollars for normal evo six we can't bring this one and it has to be the tommy mac and then this one which sort of looks like a tommy mac

(Start: 00:12:11)
missing a few odds and ends and the stickers and all that twenty one thousand us dollars so i'll work this out roughly twenty five thousand us dollars from my memory is what i found one of the auctions months and months and months ago possibly over a year ago 25 000 us dollars that would land you at 530 to 560 000 rand registered on the road now the last vehicle i haven't seen one at the auctions for over two years is the subaru impreza 22b the 22b just recently sold it was one that just recently sold for 312 000 us dollars last year there was also one that sold for roughly hundred thousand us dollars but that is a lot of money for something i mean it's very rare they made limited numbers 399 okay but for something that is that old and it's not that much better of a spec than a p1 str version 6. i mean there's so many

(Start: 00:13:11)
rare variants out there there's a richard burns model which is the uk model it was the p1 also uk model there's quite a few but this was the true i don't know how to word this but when you when you play in gran turismo or any other racing game or look at manga and anime it's always a 22b when you're looking at that style the gc8 variants it's the 22b that's out there and everybody knows the 22b for its wide body and flares and all that stuff but truly unobtainable at the moment especially at the auctions those my friends are the only vehicles currently that you're allowed into south africa as collectors items like i said anything else you got to be returning resident or you can import other stuff you can import an s15 silver but you have to bring it in as a race car and that's unfortunate anyway i am working on a petition i need to get off my lazy ass and finish things and hand it over to a friend of mine who is a copywriter and he's going to sort things out for me and then we're going to fight the good cause

(Start: 00:14:12)
i probably can't afford one right now actually for a while because of my kids and i've got six cars outside i'm stupid anyway i can't afford it right now but i'd love to get these cars into the hands of south africans at um as collectibles that being said thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it i'll see you all in the next video peace

Title: PROJECT R33 - Rust Conversion And Lexan Glass
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3twvMCm5zM

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome to a brand new video i'm gonna be working on the r33 today as per the title of the video i've been neglecting the car for about two and a half weeks plus minus and for good reason my daughter's been on school holidays so i've been spending a lot of time with her um took some time off work as well and well i just haven't had time for the car plus i've been working on the rx-7 because i i like to move on to different things and try not get bored but we back i feel bad for the car um and i need to get things sorted out i'm having an issue at the moment uh i think it was in the last video i mentioned that i'm waiting for the previous owner to give my rear quarter window back that's kind of not happening right now which sucks um i don't blame him he sent the coin to a mechanic workshop and they've got the car in storage and they're just not getting to it i'm not going to mention any names i don't want to give them bad rep i'm going to have to bite the bullet i've got that piece of polycarb that gary donated to me and it looks like we just have to fit it now i was trying to avoid doing that because i wanted to wait for this glass back and

(Start: 00:01:00)
then just keep it aside in case i even needed it i'm going to cut it up cut it to size and we're just going to stick it on and it's going to be missing all the trim and all the good looking stuff but it's going to stop all the crap from going into the car because there are geckos in the car right now there might be rats that are coming into the car the rats might be coming in because of the what do you call it the gear shifter thing not being there but we're going to sort that crap out now and then something cool okay this is heavier than i thought this big cannon right this is check out a real apexi n1 exhaust it's a big boy okay 115 millimeter exit this exhaust was not the shiny unfortunately i decided not to film because my daughter was playing and i was right next to polishing this thing but take a look at the pictures it looked like absolute horseshit when it came here i swapped i made to mine some gauges and give me those check this out

(Start: 00:02:01)
so 115 millimeter for that side this is big this whatever the hell this side is it's probably 135 and then the backyard was a little bit concerned because it looked small well it is smaller so that's 76 mil but here is 88. so it looks like this piece was welded on after the fact here's the right size so what i'm gonna do i'll get a chopped over here where it's 88 and this is perfect not for the r33 but i've got that kakimoto exhaust which looks awesome still looks nice the problem with that exhaust it's got a lot of packing it's highly restrictive and uh well an apex you would look cooler on the r32 gtr so i'm going to move that across move the khaki motor across to the project 33. let's go play the car [Music]

(Start: 00:03:10)
so what i'm using is this uh brew rust rust converter this destroys rust protects iron i can't find this anywhere my dad gave it to me it's probably 10 15 years old it still works [Music] i don't know if you guys can see that but it's made the affected areas go blue

(Start: 00:04:12)
i vaguely remember this on the mot i mean look at this i put the fender on because i kind of wanted to see a little bit of a complete car it looks so much better with the fender and this fender's actually not so bad the other one's perfect this side the issue of the issues are here so at the bottom there's a bit of a ding there down there and then at the top here in the corner so where it meets the a-frame there and then right here right in the front okay i'm pretty much done i think i've got the entire front end already at least what i can see the only thing i haven't done is remove the fender and then done underneath i'll get to that later of course you do the bonnet now [Music]

(Start: 00:05:36)
so [Music] so [Music] so the bottle says leave the stuff on

(Start: 00:06:38)
for three to six hours and then you can paint it if it says it's not necessary but if you want to you can paint over it uh which i probably am with some hammer but take a look at this so earlier i said it was going like a little bit blue it's actually gone black now or like a dark purple and now where there used to be rust spots that were kind of rough it's silky smooth now that's so cool i've never used this stuff before [Music] another issue that i'm having is there's a lot of morning juice and with the car cover closed a lot of the condensations going inside so it's not just the creatures living in here i'm getting

(Start: 00:07:38)
mold and mildew coming in because of this so i want to put all the trim on close this up and then wait for the window to run [Music]

(Start: 00:08:38)
so [Music] uh hmm i'm actually thinking i'm going to leave some of the stuff on because the window doesn't bend too well if that makes sense not when the polycarb i'm just going to shave this a little bit and then as soon as i get the actual window you know things would actually fall into place because the one that i need has the trim that goes around here and the trim that goes here and i can properly secure and block i

(Start: 00:09:39)
mean stuff from going inside the car and then i need to go past the pg auto or some sort of a window shop and and get the special glue maybe builders might have for now i'm just going to use black silicon i mean i'm not driving anyway this is going to be on for maybe a month or so see that's how it's going to look now plus mana something like that [Music] so [Applause] what's your drawing i'm drawing um

(Start: 00:10:44)
um a ball and dad and me and and um two toys mine and dad's stuff my daughter was uh asking why i get to draw on my blue gtr and nobody else does so later drawings [Music] [Applause] [Music] so two thousand years later i don't know

(Start: 00:11:46)
something clicked in my head um i just got over filming i got over everything there was just so much going on that one day and i actually did a live stream the same day and things went wrong on the live stream too so i've just been off for a week in a bit um i'm back now i'm back i've got content lined up this video i don't know how long it's going to be because i didn't film a lot of the stuff but i've just done the final touch-ups on the quarter glass remember it's very temporary it's going to be on for a month or so so just quick quick throw it on throw some spray paint don't judge it looks like poop but we're gonna hit the reset button and i'm gonna be doing the interior tomorrow or the following day i'm gonna film everything it's looking damn good i don't even remember if i showed you guys this in the well previous filming that i did because i haven't looked at any of the footage but here's the fast gear yes messy everywhere the first gear has been redone i wasn't happy with that finish

(Start: 00:12:47)
that was on there before because you can see a lot of imperfections so this is hammered silver and it hides a lot of imperfections which is fantastic so the interior needs a massive cleanup it's uh there's cigarette butts in there there's all sorts of stuff remember earlier in the video i think i did say there's something still living in the car well i found it have a look at this that's morning jew that left behind the imprints of a big fat gecko he fell when i opened the door and he ran away somewhere else okay so he was trapped in the car uh well not really trapped but he enjoyed the stay in the jdm vehicle so what i've done is i put all the rubbers back in off cam let's go take a look check it out i got a quarter glass just busy spraying i'll show you guys just now uh what did i do see those pull the rubbers back in i put all the fittings back in put that back in see the interior is disgusting cigarette butts i need a vacuum it's got

(Start: 00:13:50)
mold growing on it but check out the doors actually close properly now they're not hard enough watch there you go sounds good sounds solid it's catching on the fan of the fenders not i'll put the fender on on the top but i didn't see that catching on the fender let me sort this out how solid does it sound okay so having these rubbers in place i'm gonna stop funny creatures from getting into the car i still want to pull them off again see that one here i still want to pull them off again because i want to clean up the doors properly this see there's a lot of gunk on the actual door frame itself we'll get to that we're going to sort out those shambles sort this out clean it up maybe start throwing some gauges and see how we go remember very temporary glass

(Start: 00:14:52)
hopefully i get the original piece the original piece has a whole frame that covers us it's got the frame that goes around in here this is all makeshift just so i can stop this from getting in the car so anyway i'm glad that i'm back i'm gonna be putting some focus on like i said we're gonna hit the interior the next day or two after that i want to get this car into the garage start cleaning it up and i also want to start sorting out that engine okay so in a day or two i'm going to sort out the interior we're going to try and complete we'll get the dash in and get everything back in with the steering wheel and then i'll start looking at running some gauges into that center piece you know where the uh the radio goes and all that stuff that whole doubled in section so i want to run boost controller gauges i know it's premature because there's not even an engine in the car but we're going to be doing that i also

(Start: 00:15:53)
have some exciting news when it comes to coilovers we'll get into that there's going to be a mega special video for that um coilovers coming on the car there's these wheels i'm thinking about actually i'm going to dirt i just i don't know how i'm gonna do it because i'm trying not to leave the house uh but there's a company called hannaford tyres or hannaford wheels and they trade they do trade-ins so i'm thinking about getting trading these plus another set of 15s that i have that came off the mr2 you guys might have remember that from the previous video the black one trading those eight wheels and for some 17 something that'll look okay on this car remember i'm on a tight budget here i'm not allowed spending my salary on this car i can on on those but the wife has given me clear clear instructions not to spend money on what she refers to as a piece of scrap metal so this is fully funded by youtube um

(Start: 00:16:55)
some crypto that's about it so anyway let's see how that goes uh it's gonna be slow we got to grow i'm making a ramya rap all right guys thank you so much for watching really appreciate it see you all next time peace [Music] um

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome to what possibly could be the best episode of jdm cars for sale in south africa [Music] i have found 27 japanese and jdm cars in this town some real jdm cars that i did not expect to see for sale online diving right into it we're starting with the weirdest one that is possibly here for sale which is a 2.8 gtx that has been converted into an r34 i post this on my instagram last week and there were mixed reactions a lot of people said no burner to death a lot of people said it's actually pretty cool and i'll tell you one thing because the guy wants a hundred thousand rent for this car i'll tell you one thing okay if this is a genuine bumper genuine bonnet genuine fenders etc i don't think the bumper is genuine just looking at it again but everything else if it's genuine it is worth a lot more than 100k okay so i'll tell you that much it's got an rb25 i had a funny comment on i think it was either instagram or tech talk about this and someone said

(Start: 00:01:01)
the engine looks like it came out of toyota test this isn't rb25 son it's dirty but don't look like it came from tess it does look a little bit weirder with the manifold in the turbo setup gotta admit missing a rear windscreen and the little quarter glass is not closing for some reason the back looks weird the car looks strange from the rear but i think overall fitment was done quite well and it's it's pretty impressive to actually see something like this some sort of a conversion that's gone this deep for a price that's not that big doesn't have papers but the car was sa red so you could probably say ridgid i don't know 100k for the creativity and the if that went into this i've got to give this a 7 out of 10. now i found this r33 which i'm actually taking a couple cues with regards to the the front uh what do you call it uh parked front this is a low bros car these guys got a youtube channel and they're big on instagram drifters

(Start: 00:02:04)
r33 now you'll see see what i'm talking about it looks pretty cool here's the pop front end now this is like quite a simple setup for me to do especially for me like not knowing how to weld and all that stuff i'm gonna get all these points right i don't know what engine this is looking at it from that angle doesn't say anywhere apparently not a cent to be spent who knows the gtst however mine's gts so this one is one up better than mine but it's been gutted so same same uh not a lot of info at an auto engine not a sense of speed give that a five out of ten and i found this 300 zx project car not so great we'll jump into that right away it doesn't have papers and it looks like it's been sitting for a while there's grass growing into the engine bay so that's quite scary straight off the bat the paint is absolutely screwed there's some rust here it's not surface rust that's balls deep rust it's a t-top

(Start: 00:03:06)
i don't know how much he wants for this car it could be super cheap so it could be used as a parts car it doesn't alter though i wouldn't spend more than like i don't know maybe 15 20k on this car since it doesn't have paper since an auto since it's been sitting for god knows how long it doesn't actually say it looks like it's been sitting for a good couple of years unfinished project car no papers cool reuben you know i like collecting i'll probably buy this if it was cheap uh five out of ten then we have this 280zx i think it may have been on the channel before no it hasn't but this one's neat it's 150k not a lot of info it's it's in mint conditions and hormones hit a minus and i like it no interior picks no engine vape picks doesn't have the stock wheels but it actually looks pretty damn good on these particular wheels give this car six out of ten then we got

(Start: 00:04:08)
this beaut of a 34 absolute beast 2.1 mil i've seen this car for sale oh sorry i've seen this car before not for sale seen in speed and sound or something gogeta wp western province it's got those raised wing extenders it's got the extra lip on the back this is zg and stuff just by the way i think that says i'm spooling aubrey 26 obviously big oil catch can set up changed the plenum he's got hks rails don't know whatever that is strut brace coilovers huge intake sideways pick normal pick here we go i actually didn't read through this so steve clark gc racing that's good side clock racing or no sweat racing uh it's the most sought after gtr prices are skyrocketing now he's asking

(Start: 00:05:08)
2.1 million remember you can land this car for about 2.2 also about 2.1 2.2 in stock form i'm talking base model maybe a v-spec model this has got lmgt4 wheels the wheels alone or like 70k he's got z2 zetchine stuff stitching bumper fenders bonnet nismo side skirts led reverse slots dudes come to town with this car it's damn good if you're going to be buying a gtr from overseas m41 you might as well get this i got to give this i mean everybody would give this one it's got to be a 9 out of 10 especially for that price i mean it's  high i'd have to sell all my cars and one of my limbs and then we've got this one all the way in henneman free state villaim i've dealt with villain my apexi power fc that's sitting in my r32 gtr came from villam i bought it from him years ago like a good five years ago

(Start: 00:06:09)
i lost his number and i lost contact with willem so now i've got his number again i don't know maybe i'll give him a shout but i'm not gonna be for buying the car he's got a gorgeous r33 his engine weighs yellow i'm not too sure about that but it's got new tires got big ass brakes there's no pick on the actual top of it but it i don't know it's yellow need though you want 700k which is about right you could land one from japan for about 650 these days but this has got a whole lot of work and you can land one from japan with all the specular stuff so again good value for money here i'm going to give vellum an 8 out of 10 for this r33 absolutely gorgeous plus it looks like the new tires on it check that they've got this 200 sx which looks like it could be a project car make an take a look quickly i think that's a gp sports front bumper does it say anything like that

(Start: 00:07:10)
nope got that nice swing i dig that wing tail lights would have been better with that wing so cr18 det that respray is pretty crap you re-spread over parts and it's like yeah ew those seats are dodgy but it comes with a screwdriver and comes with electrical tape and the steering wheel steering wheel is abused nabila solomon uh 85k negotiable has a body kit on it it's esse reg the aircon used to be regressed um yeah okay decent as a project car i guess but not for that price you drop good 25k on that anyway get a 5 out of 10 for that one then this has been on the channel before

(Start: 00:08:12)
but the process dropped now 249k for this z31 turbo now this is time machine spec we've been through it before i'm not going to give it a rating it's got that v6 turbo look at this everything is original everything the pulleys the flipping radiator pops i don't think the alarm system is but everything else is look at this it's got this chub car secure that's the alarm system you don't type in the code it'll unlock the car so cool look at this nothing is touched this is the car you buy and if you touch or modify something you get slept around badly this is the one that you park off and you keep with covers on and climate control room screw it i'll give it a number again we'll go 8 out of 10 for this bad boy and we got this 300 zx with 75k cheap but always about

(Start: 00:09:13)
lesotho papers not lesotho lesotho papers unfortunately so it's not rich and is it the turbo version no it's in a 75k uh unregistered car i don't think it's such a great deal even if you have to buy it as a spear spare parts car for your essay reg one probably not worth it you can't register it either so that kind of sucks um probably be better off selling it back in lesotho who knows 5 out of 10 for you and then this r32 gtr which is selling here in durban it says selling behalf of my friend the car has many extras ran an engine oh i didn't read that engine rounded bearings the car was popped off since he's selling a cheap because it ran a bearing okay it's a rust damage that's nasty rust

(Start: 00:10:17)
look who knows how bad the the damage is on the engine that's that's the risk that you got to take but 450k is cheap i was gonna say it's very cheap if it was running but now that we know there's an issue i mean you could probably knock them down to like 375 maybe 400k at least i would i would try i mean i own one of these i know the value of them no i know how much i paid for it which was a joke not even to tell you guys um knock it down needs to be knocked down especially that rust damage it looks fairly stuck uh than the wheels got the same in one body kit that i've got on mine decent no picture hunters and time wasters cool um a little bit too high dude i gotta say 7 out of 10. and then we got this proper

(Start: 00:11:19)
jdm nissan prosaiya 1.616 valve valve import car have all necessary paperwork you can spell necessary right but you can't fulfill valve or alternator car needs wheels alternator and some tlc contact globus sorry english is probably not your first language i'm being mean this is just satire just by the way out i'm taking the purse uh needs a new side mirror i don't know what the happened yeah possibly someone left the 20 liter of paint on there and the car just said bumper screwed windscreen is cracked uh 10 grand though for something that's unusual kind of looks like a mess that etude the rear okay block everything else out doesn't the rear lights on this picture look like an s15 silver yes or no strange uh i gotta give the box like a four out of ten and then we have this rx8 sa registered it's pretty cheap it's in good running condition

(Start: 00:12:20)
it's the high power version so there's like 132 kilohertz you want 70 grand for it really not that bad if the car is in decent condition and it looks like it is actually in pretty decent condition there's a lot of beetles around the area and that's probably why i want to get rid of it because it doesn't fit in 70 grand it's a steal i wouldn't even look out me being me try knocking down still but good price very good price you may swap for a small bucky seven out of ten for this one and then some more real jdm right here nissan infinity q45 okay this is a big ass family sedan this was contending with the lexus of the time which would have been the gs 300 it's about the same size this is a lot uglier and this was pretty powerful yeah 207 five years this is a 4.5 liter

(Start: 00:13:20)
v8 in here so it would actually be continuing with the lexus gs430 or the ls430 i know this will be containing the ls series this is a boat 1990 model but check those isn't that registered nw oh no oh no i thought a c g i don't know is this quite so rich it's got a thing here i don't know could be if it's so rich i mean you could pick up something that's highly unusual if you're into that whole i don't know like old jag scene and old lexus scene vrp stuff sweep it up six out of ten because i don't know if it's esse reg and then uh this car's popped up before

(Start: 00:14:21)
i don't know why i open this up but uh the car needs to be resprayed apparently everything's complete doesn't look complete to me it looks like it's in pieces that's 120k for a heap of extra parts included don't know what it is is it a twin turbo model is it what is it who knows crappy ad four out of ten just for your honda boys i only did this for you guys i am based in tembisa at wii la lumbo you can come and view the car there's nothing to fix let's see if there's something to fix jdm as i don't know so much about those i mean that's pretty cool you've you've got an extra mile you've got a real cage is that a cage in the back look i like the effort it's the only honda i'm showing in tonight's video well done i think well done on what

(Start: 00:15:22)
you've got 50k is probably not too much to ask for what is done i see something wrong your door handle you fix your door handle ha there's something to fix you said nothing to fix i found the door handle there might be something else that's bust check where's your door handle bruh cool cool car nonetheless i'll give this a 6 out of 10. those came up in the live stream the other day the guy wanted 70 or 75k one of you guys i forgot who someone asked beast max they might have been beast max and the car is mozambican registered the guy won 75k for it it's a we calculated during my live stream that we could land one in south africa the same spec the same model all that you can't obviously because not a collector's item but if you could you could land it with the rv25 neo and all that junk exactly the same without the straps

(Start: 00:16:24)
for like 50k or under 50k but we can't anyway so what's the point so it mustn't be registered and it's a four-door there power 10 oh i'm stand corrected there's another honda okay i'm in civic those are only civic for the night pristine spec uh flint black factory color glass roof cool sounds cool no ridiculous offers open swaps and rear wheel drive cars hey mr2 that's my thing don't knock me honda guys d1 spec seats are cool they've got a gear lock on it very jdm i like i like it process a bit higher i don't know what the value that i don't know what if they sought after or i'd rather sell it stuck to a more passionate honda person

(Start: 00:17:25)
fair enough one of your honda guys could buy it it looks decent looks okay um i'll give this a seven out of ten i don't know nothing about it but i think it's cool wait that's a different steering wheel it is too the other steering wheel is better dude okay this is a good price okay subaru swap for breakdown i don't know what that means do you want to break a nice car because i've got that r33 that's screwed crashed um no look i don't know what the hell he's talking about two thousand two two seven seven two thousand i'm guessing it's 2000 model i don't know it's a advert there's one picture i don't understand what he's talking about and he wants 80k for the car and price is like market related whatever uh good tires new tires are nothing good but new tyres um six out of ten

(Start: 00:18:25)
no should add five out of ten then we got this one 2.5 turbo so someone's on an ej25 swap it was 90k and now that's 79. it's got a sunroof so this is what they refer to as the wrx premium back in 2005 that only came out in 2005 i know this because i had a wrx period i had a str wing on the back and i had the boot swap from an str actually the entire boot came with an sdi i had a whole lot of done tomorrow and this could actually be that carb delta but dude why'd you put that in here it's this anyway 80k could get you this thing i don't know um six out of ten and then i keep getting hounded by you guys for this a sabre i know nothing about the saber i think it's got a sr20 de

(Start: 00:19:27)
in it it says the gs gxi 200 so i'm assuming it's a two liter that intake thingy it's a northwest province car that looks nice that looks decent it's an sr20 but not the det it's got mids it's got messed up leather it's got half no that's not leather at all um it's got a stockish steering wheel and it's got 290 000 kilometers on the clock carpets look okay except for that i mean you take this picture shouldn't you like just push that up or just cable tie it man was spraying down his engine bay covered his intake didn't cover any electricals no aircon [Music] i see an r30 skyline or r31

(Start: 00:20:30)
6 out of 10 i don't know anything about sabers and then this thing has got a lexus v8 swap in this rx-8 i lost the papers starts up and drives just marched the clutch blower 45k or something with lost paper that seems a little bit dodgy how do you lose papers surely if you lost them you can get the vin number you can go and sort that out at the last listing apartment and then get more for the vehicle who knows 610. and then this this was in that live stream another night as well um there's a 34 is that 34 i think so they were really small pictures this was a box i'm not going to give it a ready it'll probably even worse now it's sitting at the rock raceway at the mechanic place and it's got a 1j in it in a2 it's got two fuel pumps and blah blah 48k the car looks  disgusting

(Start: 00:21:32)
it needs to be wired and i don't know whatever next one's cheap 10 grand lands you the silica um it looks like an st 202 normally aspirated front wheel drive more than likely has no papers it's got a 3s ge in it and it's cheap it's dirt cheap i don't know if it runs what not there's a window that belongs here who knows why it's off um that's a bloody good price even if you wanted to do something with this car i don't know what but cheap then we've got the subaru also cheap 13 grand front end sold no motor front-end solar rooms i don't know 5 out of 10 for this thing then we got another uh gtse so it's got the 3s gte engine and this one uh must be a swap this is also sd202

(Start: 00:22:33)
maybe it doesn't gtse maybe it doesn't have the engine oh no i think it does this looks like the turbocharged one must've been dropped in here car's not essay reg so we just give this a 5 out of 10 there's probably nothing we can really do with it and then i'll save the best two for last funny enough that both red s14s and they're both friends of mine and both of these cars have come to my house at the same time now the first one you can't get any more jdm than this unfortunately he has to sell the car he's got a business that he's opening and he needs the crown it's an s-14 1985 i believe this car is built by rezlo racing he's like godlike when it comes to the sr motors he's got quite a bit of stuff done to it except for the rods and head that's stuck um exhausts decent exhaust he's got two shotgun things in the back i see that funny uh power spirit power spirit's basically the boating version of the garrett if

(Start: 00:23:34)
i'm not mistaken and then it's got a small exhaust housing that means it's going to spool very quickly i dig this it's got an ap apex rfc with a hand controller just like my rx7 and gtr it's got a map sensor which is cool just like my rx7 it's got oil pressure oil temp it's got unknown brand of coilovers blah blah t-37 reps anyway he's selling the car with the reps at 155 or without the reps at 145 either way super good price for the car to be honest bumper's a little bit screwy but the rest of the car is pretty neat it's mud there's the engine bay it's got some glitter top paint on here i don't know if that's been repaired but that's cool that's different and he's got where is it he's got sr of the world on here that i thought it was sp at once it's sr the world and then he's got a cobra seat and

(Start: 00:24:34)
he's got that same gear knob that i used to have in my 33 a32 eo kind of got rid of it uh this is the apexy piracy hand controller so that's the one car um there is a video if you guys want to check out it's called two big spec sylvia's s14 came to visit and they came to my house by them and i did a little bit of a walk around there's two of them and we took a look at engine bays and whatnot so we'll take a look at the other one right now this is the other one this has got a little bit more of an in-depth build uh fully forged bottom end with a whole lot of work that's got into it very similar to but it's on the car i think it's also power spirited for more mistaken uh power spirit same exhaust sizing and uh we've got an intercooler from mr turbo radiator sorry and a whole bunch of other stuff so estimated to do around 500 horsepower and these are brian crowler cams as well also screwy front bumper uh but both cars cool nonetheless both of them have cape town lever plates

(Start: 00:25:35)
um he came from cape town i don't know i'm not mentioning names here but i don't know where the other guy came from and why it's got cape town plates but it is what it is these two cars are both friends of mine um if i had the money i would buy them both but i've also been told that if i buy any more cars right now i will be looking for another place to live by myself so that is it uh both these cars are cool i would try to snap them up both are cool in their own way that is it for the video i'm not giving these ratings because they're both friends of mine but very very high ratings for both thank you so much for watching i will see you all in the next one peace

Title: MY JDM CARS HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS CLEAN!

(Start: 00:00:00)
all right boys for the first time since february 2020 i have someone over at my house uh not in the house but outside i'm asked up he's messed up we're gonna be doing something cool on the cars uh not on the 33 but uh on the mr2 and on the lexus dude it's been a year plus since you've been on the vlog about 15 months maybe about 15 months you guys remember gareth garth and i used to shoot features we used to do all sorts of stuff on monika's car on another black mrt there anyway there were tons of features that we did we're going to be doing some cool stuff today because i got some exciting news and i've been wanting to tell you guys for a little while now but yeah i think i'll just show you take a look at this [Music]

(Start: 00:01:01)
all right [Music] um [Music] uh your boy is officially a brand ambassador for detail ease so what is detail ease well it's a high-end ceramic sealer that you can use

(Start: 00:02:03)
on pretty much any surface plastic metal etc etc i will be honest i was skeptical at first because it's waterless anything that doesn't need water when you're washing well it's a bit nerve-racking especially if there's a lot of dust and you know you can get swirl marks and scratches and all that sort of stuff but let me tell you it really really does work i mean you saw in the video how clean the mr2 came out the lexus also looked fantastic i'm going to show you now on the rx7 and we're going to do a real world test right now so it's super simple even someone like me can figure it out because all the instructions on the back so all you need to do is you need to spray onto a damp microfiber cloth so i've dedicated my green cloth to that then you need to give it a gentle wipe on the surface with the damp cloth and then you've got to switch to your dry cloth and you need to fold it and then buff off the remaining haze before it dries and then you just repeat the process on the entire vehicle and you do this in a one by one meter one one square meter area on the vehicle

(Start: 00:03:05)
okay guys this is a no test you all know this vehicle my rx-7 this came from japan uh average paint it's not so bad but it's never had a proper detail now listen to this it's rough okay it's been washed before a couple times but it's never had a detail like i said so now remember you just need a little bit of a damp cloth this one's a little bit too damp that works and then you're going to work on a one square meter area so i'm going to work on something like that and what you're going to do is you're going to spray a little bit onto the cloth and then a little bit onto the body now you got to do this in a shaded area garage carport something along those lines that'll work that's good now you take your folded

(Start: 00:04:07)
cloth and you just rub that make sure all that haze is gone i can really see the difference i don't know if you can on the camera but listen to this now i can't hear anything because it's smooth okay let's try the other side spray a little bit on get out for me a little bit too much but we'll work with that i'll just spread it over it extra [Music] and area got to quickly take your dry cloth remember use the microfiber ones that you can there is an option to buy it with the microfiber

(Start: 00:05:07)
i'm just going to remove that hazel [Music] and this is silky smooth now now remember if you do have issues with your paintwork they're still going to show if you've got deep scratches that sort of stuff still going to show this is going to make it shine this is a detailer so i've never been big on detailing and that sort of stuff i mean i do watch cars but detailing has always been a mission for me and i guess the name of this product kind of just means everything to me detail ease it is so easy to apply so easy to get that nice shine i'm stoked like i said i was skeptical i'm stoked it's actually working out there is a ten percent discount if you use my code now cal jdm 10. so you guys have seen it firsthand here on the channel

(Start: 00:06:08)
it works i'm stoked i'm happy it's a good product i'm not gonna just gonna advertise stuff that doesn't work all right boys so that is it from myself and the detail ease crew there's a ton of support go follow them on instagram as well um if you're not following me on instagram i'm gonna hit me up with a follow i'm sure you are already quick update before we end the video i'm gonna be working on the r33 again this rx-7 is finished i'm done i'm just waiting for the fuel pumps to arrive still once the fuel pumps here i'm gonna start road shooting for now the car just gonna sit pack it away the r33 a couple of videos ago i showed you guys that i wasn't so happy with some of the uh interior parts like the fescue and that sort of stuff that there was some imperfections from sun damage what i wanted to do was pick up that vht wrinkle paint um i phoned around nobody's got stock of it right now or at least black there's red available there's also blue available i didn't even know it was around but i need to sort that out and to fill it and to get it right it's just such a mission because it's so badly damaged i found this other stuff it's called uh

(Start: 00:07:11)
oh man it's inside the house now but it was either rust-oleum or another brand and it's a textured or hammered type paint i think it is a rustoleum and apparently it hides imperfections i'm going to give that a shot in the next video i'm also going to be putting the dash together dash is here next to me and i've got something big and exciting that is going to be going on the r33 so that will be happening in the next few days that is it for this video thank you so much for watching appreciate any support remember 10 discount if you use my code all the links in the description take a look go for the detail ease follow myself on instagram i'm on tick tock as well thank you so much for watching see you all next one [Music] peace [Music] uh

Title: Single Turbo RX7 FD3S Get's new parts! Apexi and HKS
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2SjWrr6Pfk

(Start: 00:00:00)
what is up guys and welcome to a brand new video you can see i've got an rx-7 behind me we're going to be doing some work on the car it's been a little while and i'm struggling a bit if you watch the previous video when i was doing work on the r33 i was complaining a little bit about my garage situation and i didn't exactly come right i kind of ran out of time again and i've decided this is what i'm going to be doing putting the people's skyline in the carport because the names have like slowed down a bit i'm only getting like six to 10 day which is cool so i can do that on the cardboard that's non-issue i'm going to bring the rx-7 in here because we're going to be doing a couple things today one of them is fitting those apexi coil leads the second one is i want to change the boost controller on the car i want to put a later model hk's evc i have i've got an h case evc in there but it's uh it's a three or four i forget anyway we're just gonna move the cars around and then we're gonna get cracking with some work maybe maybe i don't know because i'm still doing work on the i-33 behind me

(Start: 00:01:01)
maybe pull the bumper off the watchmaker off the rx-7 and start fitting this because i've got all the lights and everything everything's yeah there's one there's another one behind it actually there's two there there in between the dump valve [Music] so i gained a little bit more storage space i've hung that and then i've also had this i was gonna say veil sideways is it a veil starting i don't remember now this was the same wing that was on those hondas in the first fast and furious when they went underneath the truck i love this interior i haven't finished cleaning it all up properly but like like this this i need to redo the idea is there

(Start: 00:02:07)
[Music] i gotta charge that battery check this out this car still got a working ac like full-on this is cold get like 20 but it works nothing wrong with it also [Music]

(Start: 00:03:08)
[Music] [Music] something funny the car covers that i own they're all the same size they're all large this car cover barely fits on this car it keeps flying off the wind it goes up to just about there in the back it doesn't cover the front properly anyway on the 32 it's like fully covered in the front and the back is pretty much covered tiny little piece that's not just shows you the size difference between the two since this is an fd video i want to be closing up all the stuff here lightening up because i'm going to be driving this car pretty soon just waiting for my fuel pumps to arrive so

(Start: 00:04:10)
okay let's go baby neighbors love me [Music] foreign should be enough now i'm going to let it run for a little while so i don't flood it the next time i want to start it i'm sorry oh look at it decided i need

(Start: 00:05:13)
to kind of organize some of my jdm i've got some more wheel thingies there recorder wheel caps and then pivot water temp uh grady oil temp grady turbo grady turbo one's mechanical one's electronic grady exhaust temperature blitz exhaust temperature grady something exhaust temperature hks exhaust on a case oil temp blitz water temp blitz turbo mechanical hk evc 4 boost controller a cross boost controller plus it's like a piggyback ecu as well hk's evc 5 or ez2 in some countries speed meter ultra idling timer from the 80s hks turbo timer electronic toll collection system that talks same as the fd fetc turbo timer

(Start: 00:06:17)
old-school hks turbo timer and this etc 904 boost controller with solenoids that works [Music] all right boys so we fitting these uh apexi yes there actually are a pixie [Music] look at that apexi ignition wires these are secondhand i've done continuity tests from one end to the other everything seems okay um it'll be better than what's in the car now i hope these are actually made for a pixie by none other than ngk okay well they look pretty much the same

(Start: 00:07:19)
stock one's slightly fatter super flips yeah i've got to get this right so yeah that's the one it's got a little number one over here and then i'll put some masking tape on the side just so we know that i'm actually doing the wrong one so this is supposed to go down here come on check this out the ngks i don't know if

(Start: 00:08:19)
you guys can see that but they're slightly thicker the ends are shorter both sides but it does pop in and does fit in nicely it's definitely for fds i've taken a look on the old school product catalog thing everything's out i forgot to hit the record button okay all my shit's labeled one two three nothing so that's four and then i'm probably gonna say well that's not the order i've got the order something good i'll forget because i've only done this like three maybe four times i don't remember everything i don't even remember what i had for breakfast approximately 10 hours later during that early morning stint again car's covered in due 33 says hello and i'm looking a little bit wrecked baby kept us awake i decided not to film this part because i was doing it from

(Start: 00:09:19)
the top i was blocking the camera view there's only one angle in the garage single garage issues you know the story um i've got leading coil packs right over there so there's a dual coil pack it's got leading one leading two on it and then there's trailing two and that's trailing one anyway guys i've managed to plug all the leads in from the top i didn't have to lift the car that was pretty awesome i'm going to close it up let me start with the hkcpc

(Start: 00:10:26)
that's better got it you'll see the design difference between this old one so i had to push this through the firewall which initially was the boss getting it out was a lot easier but the new one way easier here's the turmoil on the inside um i would love to film all of this but i got a wall right here sucks anyway here's the old unit i think it's a three or four hkc vc3 all right here's the solenoid that's going to be going in the corner um the display and the unit's going to be going on the inside so i was going to show you guys how easy it is to push it through but i just realized that when they sent

(Start: 00:11:27)
us from japan actually cut the ends so this is the cable that goes into the solenoid and here's the other end cleanly cut all right usually what i do is i just have to push this so i'm not too stuck in a cut but i am a man of many jdm parts check this out must have spears so this should have a complete harness thingy yep there we go sorted okay sorry my apologies i'm gonna push this one through the firewall this is gonna be pretty easy this is gonna be connected to here see if it works yep click done complete cable

(Start: 00:12:30)
other one can revise so now what i'm doing is i've taken a metal coat hanger this thing's actually quite hard to find but i'm going to take this metal coat hanger and i'm going to push it through the firewall through the grommet this is going to penetrate and i'm going to be able to put it through the other side um these coat hangers i mean you can't find them in the usual shops anymore but where you do find them are like those cheap factory shops like crazy store and that stuff if you're in south africa you'll find these metal ones i just bought a whole pack and i lost my previous one but it lasted like five years until i lasted now you just take the other end now go on the inside and i find it and then i'll just pull it through hey in the cabin

(Start: 00:13:35)
nice that was easy decided to put the camera down and just get cracking on the work i know you guys want to see all this stuff but it's so difficult in a single garage should have done this outside anyway it is what it is i finished the interior just need to button up a couple of things in the engine uh which is actually just the strut brace and then cleaning up the little makeshift table that i made all right everything is buttoned and closed up except for that side down there i've basically left the kick panel off because i'm still tuning the car so over here i've got my blitz turbo timer i've got my hks evc display on the side and then there's the boost controller rings nice and neat no cables hanging except for the turbo timer there's not much i could have done other than drill into the dash i wasn't keen on doing that check this out let's get it

(Start: 00:14:42)
foreign i haven't fixed this one down here because i'm not sure if this is what i want with regards to placement i think it looks alright um it looks like it's blocking a bit of the rpm counter but from up here where i'm sitting so that's kind of my view about 500 rpm onwards i can see i think that's around i think it looks cool it's like a minimalistic dash got my am gauge over there i was thinking about doing a boost gauge on here but then this thing tells you boost as well so i'm pretty pointless i do have one more thing in the engine bed i need to do actually three more things let me clean up this put the strut brace back i ripped some of the gold paints over here whoops and then i need to do my plumbing i forgot to do my plumbing for the hps edc and it's not bolted on properly yet because i don't know placement wise i'm going to do that off cam i want to bore you guys and then we're going to take a car for a test drive soon promise so i thought i'd just do a little bit of different content it's been an r33 r33r334 time now plus i've been sitting down doing a lot of jdm cars for sales africa

(Start: 00:15:43)
videos and lots of sit down videos i've been neglecting this car at least on video i've been neglecting it neglecting the other cars the gt i've been studying and driving around the block all that sort of stuff but yeah focused heavily on filming the r33 i do have some cool stuff that's gonna be going on the car soon one is the dash the dash actually came out okay let me just show you guys i'll give you guys a tiny sneak peek it's not bad i'm still going to redo it because i want to learn and i want to learn how to do it properly and i think i know how to do it better now so i'm going to redo it but it's going to go in the car for now uh with the fast gear and all that other stuff and then this this looked horrific it was like gone like some funny white colors like burnt it looks almost brand new now not that i'm gonna go for an order so we gotta probably open this up when i get the gearbox got a little bit wider but i felt like i should just re-spray it anyway for the sake of respraying anyway that's

Title: Project R33 - Getting Things Done
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw_PIWa8kaU

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys welcome to a new video um i'm a little bit frustrated i'm frustrated with my setup my plans i'm like you know it's stuff that i can't change anymore i bought this house for a few reasons one it was cheap it was a deceased estate um two it had the space that i could build on where i could store cars but storing them not very well and one of them is i only have a single garage and i've got quite a bit of room in terms of the driveway where i can leave cars but then turning space is an issue it's a bit of a drama then i've got the carport where i can store two cars so that's all great but i'm using my garage as like a workbench slash storage area and i'm getting highly highly frustrated at the moment um i was about to start this video on the r33 and we're going to clean up the the boot trunk whatever you guys want to call it so like where do i store all that stuff while i'm working on the car and then i need to come back in here

(Start: 00:01:00)
and the problem is and this is why i'm also getting frustrated with myself is that i'm doing all this work on the 33 and i'm coming in and out for tools and everything's such a rush because i'm i'm doing like an hour or two a day and then i basically work up until i have to go back inside and either go to work or help with the kids etc and i just throw my tools down which is not a good thing to do and it's bad shop garage etiquette so what i want to do quickly is this okay so here's the first one this is a lot of junk everywhere i can't swear my daughter's behind me and the gtr is playing on her phone um so nice swearing this bumper is taking up a lot of space there's room in the corner where i can store stuff my desk is an absolute shambles i've been throwing stuff i set up a screen here and a switch here because i was doing that live stream the other day i've got the engine sitting here which i need to finish and then i've got the dashboard which i've fully completed the what they call it recovering it actually looks okay it looks horrific from underneath but it actually

(Start: 00:02:01)
looks okay from the top and we're going to use it for a couple months until i move back to it and we can recover it again because i've learned from our mistakes now okay then i've got fenders lying around i mean i literally cannot get around this side of the garage and uh i made a tick tock video the other day asking if anybody wants their names in the car and i've actually moved on from the roof and now i'm doing the passenger door and then that's it and it's just the rear of the car that's left so here's my bright idea i've already done one i've got these big hooks okay not like that little tiny hook that holds up ecus and stuff i got these bigger slightly heavy duty ones i think it may just be enough to hold up the bumper or maybe the wing we'll see how it goes i'm gonna throw another one up there i'm hooking up where the rafters are i can see where the rafters are because all you guys should be able to see too see that that's where the nails were right

(Start: 00:03:04)
[Music] it's wet it's a toy dad take a picture i'm talking picture you know his name no his name's godzilla is he a doe or boy he's a boy hey that worked out actually pretty decently uh i've now won a whole bunch of space back on the floor and and that's the hardest thing about the garage is you got to try and not use floor space because you need to walk around you need a temporary spa etc okay before i carry on cleaning up this mess off cam um i need a box because first of all congratulations to your virtuoso you won the raffle and that means you saw africa you win that an ae86 trainer sprinter that'll work

(Start: 00:04:09)
okay so you get yourself an r33 it's a pullback car unopened r32 oh sorry that one was a 32 this is the 33 pullback power unopen you get a little miata this one is opened an open little samurai dude you get yourself some you get yourself a hot wheels rx-7xd nail cal jdm sticker and a proper jdm sticker all right i need to pack this with something and then seal it up and sort out a courier and send off those other envelopes damn it's hot in here um i'm going to clean up off cam make this place nice pick and span hopefully this doesn't fall on my head and well for you guys it's easy just snap my fingers and we're working on r33

(Start: 00:05:11)
[Music] switch [Music] [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:06:24)
so one thing that sucks about this design is that down here there's no there's no holes so the water kind of just pulls up which is obviously an issue um what i'm just gonna do is grab as much as i can of the cloth it was just too much of a bastard just to clean my hand so i've done it with the hard pressure i'm still gonna clean up my hand now and then there's a lot of rust again it's just surface rust it's really not bad at all and it will get worse if i just well leave it so that's good and then down on the corners here i was a little bit concerned about about water getting getting pulled up again and uh it's it's not an issue because there's a bunch of holes down there i've thrown my hands down and the water has already cleared up which is great still a lot of down here

(Start: 00:07:49)
[Music] canvas is showing over here i've got a mask again so i'm talking like an okay i definitely need to sort something out on this disc and clean up the caliper but uh not now i'm going to try and throw this tire on oh this wheel i think it's a multi pc it's got a whole bunch of holes must be actually doesn't look too bad on there i'm surprised [Music] i know this works it holds the pressure for about a day and then it's completely gone what i

(Start: 00:08:51)
want to do is move the car it's taking up turning space and i'm going to start doing some front end [Music] stuff [Music] [Music] i'm pretty sure there's something living inside this car there's uh

(Start: 00:09:53)
rat droppings and there's gecko droppings i'm not taking any chances if it's uh old or new whatever i'm gonna bug the ship [Music] hopefully you guys can hear me okay this is actually the first time i'm vlogging with a super windy day out i want to talk to you guys about something get some advice here my the front end of the car is actually okay it's bad but it's not as bad as i thought it would be and i wanted some advice okay here's where we test the microphone because it's facing away from you now it's direction let's open this up quick

(Start: 00:10:55)
all right the bottom is pretty screwed i'm not too worried about that we'll make a plan of the bonnet probably a new one or something anyway the front end of the car okay it's been in a smash and it's a little bit mangled here and there so for example here on this support so this is where the radiator attaches to it's mangled and broken over here it's a bit bent on this side and then over here this is quite a bit of damage so i'll change my old man he came around he was looking at the car for the first time yesterday hey i found a drill bit free drill bit amazing so he was taking a look at the car for the first time and he said why don't i rebuild this in terms of fixing it with some heat so for example taking stuff like this it's supposed to look like that taking this heating it bending it back to what it's supposed to look like same for this i think they had

(Start: 00:11:56)
plans to perhaps cut this out because this black marker going across here all the way there so i'm pretty sure that we're actually gonna consider cutting it out and then rebuilding that um i was thinking doing a tube front end so tubes from like here out and then across and then do this bar as well i don't know if i want to do that i wanted to do those as a learning experience so i was actually thinking about buying a welder which i'm probably still gonna do but i wanted to learn how to weld which i'm still gonna do but i'll do it with other stuff and i was thinking about doing a pop front end so that's the one option the second option is fix what's there with heat and then it kind of looks like standard sort of i still have to weld here and there i don't know it was just it was just a thought i figured i'd ask you guys see what you guys think

(Start: 00:12:57)
maybe should give it a try i mean if it doesn't work out i can always still do the tube it's not like i'm i'm hindering myself here and there's one more piece it's on the rear let me show you [Music] the back of the car i've got this bash bar over here at least i think that's what they're called i'm pretty sure it's a bash bar it's mangled especially over here okay actually it's mangled in both places mold man look today says it probably can be repaired i don't know i don't even know if i need this maybe maybe not so anyway that's pretty much it i don't want to make this video too long uh like for me on youtube like watching anything over 15 minutes i just kind of lose interest and i'll end up skipping through the video and that's it so i'm trying to keep these videos as short as possible and these are like weekly updates and obviously i'm working by myself and uh time constraints and all that

(Start: 00:13:59)
i'm doing what i can anyway we've got some exciting stuff that's gonna be happening next week the dash is fully covered uh i think i showed that in the previous video i'm gonna be throwing the dash on the first gear on the steering wheel we're gonna look at building some gauges into it um building some turbo timers boost controllers all that sort of stuff get the electronic part i just wanted to look cool and then we're gonna go on a hunt for some other cool interior bits and then with my youtube money it's been coming in so very thankful for donations and all that sort of stuff over the last couple weeks i'm looking for some side mirrors some headlights and yeah got some cool news coming up with bumper fenders bonnet something else so that is it for the video thank you so much for supporting thank you so much for watching remember to hit that like button it really really helps um drop a comment that actually helps even more thanks so much i'll see you all next one peace

Title: JDM CARS FOR SALE IN SOUTH AFRICA | Cheapest R32 GTR | 2JZ Toyota 86 and MORE!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNJBdgI22aY

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome to brand new episode of jdm cars for sale in south africa if this is the first time that you're watching one of my videos my name is nelson i own a bunch of jdm cars that i work on myself pretty horribly actually but i'll try to do everything myself and i do these sort of videos these sit down videos every now and again this particular one we're going to be reviewing cars in south africa that are being sold jdm cars only and japanese cars there is actually a subtle difference just by the by diving right into it we've got a toyota supra no it's not the jza 80 mark iv that a lot of people refer to it as so diving right into it we've got a toyota supra no it's not the mark 4 the jza 80 it is it's slightly older brother the last of the mark 3 1989 it's got a three liter turbo it's not 2jz though it's a 7m gte still a powerhouse still highly capable who is it sitting it's sitting in randberg how tang [Music]

(Start: 00:01:00)
i dig this shape i really do it's it's you know it's like i was gonna say it's not very much outdated but you look in the interior the interior is outdated look at this class check the clock ah it's actually pretty cool i'll take it down as an order anyway 146 000 round for something that looks like it's been well kept looked after it's even comes with a free mask digital dashboard it's cool i'd dig it and if this motor ever pops then you tuck in a tj and this would be a cool home for a tj and also a little bit of a sleeper i mean a lot of people see this corner like oh old supra or whatever even the same 7m gte is pretty potent and that's the one three litre turbo so i'm gonna give this car really because i haven't seen a lot of these in a little while i'm gonna give this particular one

(Start: 00:02:00)
a six and a half out of ten and then we've got this ad ten thousand round if you're looking for a cheap project car or a cheap track car okay this one's front wheel drive but it is jdm and it's true jd and this is a toyota silica st182 it's got a either i'm not too sure because there were two different variants 3s ge or a 5 sfe which came out of a camry i think this one probably has the camry engine okay there's a picture of the engine that is a 3s ge not the camry one so it's not bad it's not a bad buy but it is front wheel drive for the price i'm pretty sure it doesn't have papers there's a licensed thing here i don't know i highly doubt it this piece of glass which belongs here at least you know you get the glass project car front wheel drive worth a mention 5 out of 10. rx7fb

(Start: 00:03:01)
license up to date it's a non-turbo needs some tlc good for its age five speed manual okay that's all i can it's got the manual gearbox so the drivetrain is good the interior looks neat i don't know about this painted fescue but everything else looks decent seats are a little bit of wear and tear but i mean come on you're buying a car this old 1986 there's gonna be some wear and tear on the car this is actually really really good for the age this paint should just come off you can see here because like you're touching your handbrake a lot you're not often touching the fast gear on the car you're touching this area a lot the paints come off it comes with the free cream soda and then here's your 13 bna this is your second gen one so it's it's not great and it's not very powerful either especially when there's no turbo so there's even

(Start: 00:04:02)
less talk than what what they yeah you know that's the running joke out there it's like where's the talk in the rx-7 oh that's cool so it's got a little uh rotor as a oil cap look again project car maybe get them down to i don't know but you guys know me i'm a cheap ass i go in a lobel so 50k would probably be my offer to be honest you could probably get about 60k for this car i'll give a 7 out of 10. i like the interior oh and then this thing's been making its rounds on tiktok i saw this today actually japan the guys or japan order i was gonna say the guys who supply engines they they are one of the biggest suppliers in south africa when it comes to engines and they do a lot of performance stuff and you know when i used to live in johannesburg i used to go to the rock raceway quite often and japan auto i must say they were one of the only companies that were consistent when they

(Start: 00:05:03)
came to giveaways they were always there they were always supporting they're always sponsoring they're doing giveaways on in the middle of the shows in the middle of the drifting shows and some of the drag stuff and they'll call out people and let's say um sorry not called out but they would say okay we're gonna give away a 5 000 voucher for whatever you want in japan or auto and a lot of respect for seeing something like that and i still wish i was in johannesburg because i'd have access to companies like japan order so if you guys are watching this i've got an r33 i'm busy building and i was going to throw in my rb20 det but maybe that won't cut it so uh hit me up maybe we can do something that being said this car was on japan orders tick tock it is a beast the first picture already gives it away it's got a bloody 2j inside a beast of a 2j i'm pretty sure supplied by japan order i don't know what kit this is but it's got a kit with

(Start: 00:06:04)
a whole lot of these little rivet things is this a rocket body kit i don't know it doesn't actually say but it's got a t66 turbo net six that thing is massive it's got a super r154 five speed so the gearbox is mad new motor 550k negotiable it's a lot of money wheels are pretty sick cannots in the front i dig this wing uh i know a lot of the like 2017 uh maybe maybe even earlier like 2014 models came with these wings it was an optional like that exhaust on the back oh this car is an absolute beast i love it i love the styling i love that it's got undergone a massive hot transplant here and gotten rid of that stupid flippin td the subaru engine um all played well played on this one i'm going to give you for the absolute effort and it's a decent ad i mean i could have done a little bit more info

(Start: 00:07:06)
i'm pretty sure there is a lot more stuff that's got in here that could have been listed like what injectors what fuel pump blah blah blah blah blah you get the idea what suspension uh that being said i gotta give this ad a nine out of ten great car love it and for you all you listen fans a decent decent spec it comes with an sr-20 det not a bad price 70k it really isn't a bad price it's got oem pistons rings cams i'm not going to read through you guys can pause and read through all this stuff uh there is an aftermarket he's used for tronics there's a lot of good local support for spitronix i'm not a fan of it because it's not true jdm um you guys know me already well enough i've got a pixi power afc's in the car and i mean i wouldn't go for something stupid like a greedy emanage because that's a piggyback ecu but i'm trying to keep true to the real jdm stuff and i understand if maybe you just

(Start: 00:08:07)
don't have the support and the contacts that i do with regards to jdm and all that sort of stuff so spectronics nothing against you guys uh just yeah that's it but anyway a lot of pictures on this ad paintwork yeah there was a wing on the car it's got stock wheels uh owl that's so common seeing this like is that bad jack damage what is it i mean the car doesn't need to respray and i think this this was probably yeah probably had an issue there like missing chunk and it got repaired a little bit of rust surface rust that can come out hey that looks like my r33 full of pots in the back okay oh i get it it comes with a rebuilt sr20 det okay okay only surface rust okay that's

(Start: 00:09:08)
what i said so 70k is like an owl that is how do you [ __ ] up something so bad like that like were you holding your three month old baby no it when do you get teeth nine months old baby and your baby was chewing on your door i think my kid actually did get teeth around four months i don't remember now and it's got a sunroof at least the sunroof is not damaged here's the motor it's got cams uh where's the spec cam's replaced buddy club cam gears cool right uh i don't know 70k maybe get them down a little bit but uh decent decent build um seven out of ten we've got high numbers coming into that this car has been featured before already in the previous video but i i

(Start: 00:10:09)
thought i'd bring this up i'm not going to give it a rating i thought i'd bring this up again quick because this is a full jdm import we didn't get this particular spec it does need a respray it looks like it's losing some clear coat here and there but it's a true jdm version of this honda prelude it's a vtec and it's a manual and you don't often find a manual prelude or at least they're hard to come by um the only reason i'm bringing this up again because it was in last week's video is because it dropped by four and a half thousand round so it's forty thousand around forty five forty thousand five hundred ran there we go got it too many fours and fives in that one um maybe someone goes step it up you'll be one of the only few then we've got the subaru that has now been sold okay well it's been sold i wonder if he swapped it for another car he actually got money for it uh yeah bug our subaru sold we'll just move on

(Start: 00:11:09)
to the next one this has been on the channel twice already i mentioned it when it was 490 000 round and i mentioned it when it was at 395 000 it's a gtst so it's got an rb 25 det and it's got a really good kettle so it's got basically like a gtr cone on the front um it's got side skirts got a gtr rear wing and you know what else can i say the only reason that it's here is because the price has dropped see he dropped from 490 to 390 and now it is 330k okay gtsts are a lot cheaper compared to the well more powerful and uh all-wheel drive counterpart the gtr that being said still a decent price probably come down a little bit lower i understand gtr is about 600k but if you look at the process of gtst's in japan yes i know we can't bring these cards in no gts t's we can only bring in gtrs

(Start: 00:12:12)
as collectors items you can only bring a gtst as a returning resident or as a racecar but price it's a bit high then we've got the supra silica it's 1984 also i feel the price is quite high on this one's 48 000 round but it's got the same engine that we saw in the previous silica or supra rather 7 mgte and then he's done quite a bit it says that he's replaced all the beatings around the windows and stuff like that the papers expired in 2020 2010 so it's gonna be quite a hefty fun and they bang you monthly on that it's missing quite a few parts but i think it has potential and if you can put it back together it would be a decent buy i don't think that price is right though i think it should come down because because of the condition that it's in and missing stuff it should probably come down to like a 35 and that's just me being a cheap ass again no offense to

(Start: 00:13:13)
the owner i've got to give this ad 6 out of 10. then for your honda boys i don't do honda's you know this this one is yellow it's got a b20 b whatever that means i believe it's also came out in the honda del sol or some of them uh it's negotiable makes decent power i'm just reading off here no low ballers it's yellow did i say that i think it did white wheels silver wheels t37s i'm pretty sure they knock off one it's got a big spoon badge in the back sitting in joburg and it's 80 000 rand you could probably get them down to about 5 000 i'm kidding i'm kidding i just don't know anything about honda's 79 500 i think it looks okay um whatever 5 out of 10 be neutral here

(Start: 00:14:14)
and then we got this uh subaru b4 right in my hood this is some schlanger rocks drive and uh yeah i'm up and down here pretty often and this is a b4 twin turbo it's an automatic i think they all came in automatic because this was like your legacy was your um what do you call it like a luxury type thing i don't think there were any manuals in the b4 i may be wrong here i i just yeah all the ones that i've seen either don't have paperwork or illegally registered like registers as presidents or registered as legacy gx's that we did receive um like all of them i've seen they know a guy who knows the guy who reached through the car anyway he won 65k negotiable i don't know how it was registered it says all paperwork in order possibly is not my deal not my issue i think it looks great um it's a boat of

(Start: 00:15:17)
a car it's big it's bigger than the 33 but it's cool i dig it i like it um 65k a decent amount of money for what you get here uh negotiable as well so probably get them down to 60k seven out of ten and then i think this car already came up but it is for sale i think i actually did this in the jdm cars for sale live stream uh toyota sera i just thought i would show this again in case anybody missed it but these are very rare to see in south africa as far as i know there are only a handful that are here that are actually registered on the road i mean it's not the prettiest of cars but it is unique these doors are standard it actually does open like that standard this car has got standard wheels got the three spoke wheels on it there's absolutely nothing down to this car you even got the stock exhaust the price i don't know i don't look at series in japan so i don't know comparative

(Start: 00:16:21)
yeah you know i have seen ones in the past and i'm talking years ago i'm talking five or six years ago where they were selling them for 35 to 45 000 so i don't know if this is a bit excessive but it is very much stock and it looks clean not giving a rating it has been in one of my videos and then we got this toyota 86 and it needs a new motor and it has some front-end damage and fenders buggered and probably taking a little bit of the door with it but it looks repairable someone's stolen the wheel cap ah wheel cab what do you call that thing the fuel flap petrol flap i think the exhausts are not standard and i think that pool is very green and needs chlorine almost round there very dusty and apparently he had knocks in the car that's why motor runner bearing um yeah 70k i guess yeah i guess you know it could work reasonably priced for a

(Start: 00:17:24)
a project car of the source uh license fees and order and paperwork et cetera so it's 70k maybe i'm down to 65k and you've got a like a newish project car because generally when you get a project car it's something old like what i do so this could be something interesting um i'll give us a six out of ten uh the old faithful 280zx not a lot in this ad it just says t-top and it's a collector's item it's not a collector's item in terms of i-tech so you can't import this car well actually you can you can import you can apply for importation for vehicles from sever the south african vintage and veteran association of south africa they are there are so east africa twice i think i did they basically will give you permits and they will work with itec to get you paperwork and importation rights to bring in vehicles that are older than 40 years i believe this particular one

(Start: 00:18:25)
is older than 40 years 1981 what is that 40 years this year so you could likely import this there still is that hell of a disgusting process to bring the vehicles in but 40 years that's it that being said when when the gtr r32 and sorry not gtr when like a gtst or gts r32 1989 model that is eight years from now we can then start importing them so we've basically got the 40 year rule whereas america's up to 25 year old but we still have to ask for permission and get all that stuff in order which kind of sucks anyway uh as a project car because this does look like it's yeah been chewed up by a couple of rats uh it's got to be a four out of ten for me and then i saw this and i'm not gonna give it a rating there's one picture he wants to swap for a bucky

(Start: 00:19:26)
and i just saw that he's got a gca chair then he's got a bug wrx just thought i'd bring that up then we've got this powerhouse of a supra allegedly 1200 horsepower dm if you're interested he's in peter marisburg he's got no wing on the back and it does look like a beast i mean that roll cage is it's like if i had to build a roll cage it'll look like [ __ ] this looks amazing that is a big blower that is a neat engine it's a lot of it's been wire tucked and just clean just pure clean you can see np plates it is registered guys got a gazebo so you know i don't know how much he wants for it but it is for sale 1200 horsepower it's on drag radials uh absolute killer good luck with the sale don't know how much you want for it uh that

(Start: 00:20:26)
being said i'll just give the ad a 6 out of 10. and then we have a look to this in that live stream this is jdm collective in johannesburg they've got a bunch of jdm cars for sale and japanese cars like the r35 gtr etc but you can see those 33s in the background there's a hawkeye sti and then this beautiful 560 000 rand r33 gtr with a relatively clean boot it does come with a cd shuttle which is amazing uh interior is relatively stock it's got stock wheels in the car relatively stock i think it is actually stock except for the gear knob and then it's got nismo clocks so it's it's pretty close to being stock without that stuff and there's the vin number that's dangerous but yeah okay i don't know is it dangerous i wouldn't share mine uh just originally just an auto trader i know it's been sitting for a while they've been trying to sell for a little

(Start: 00:21:27)
while so good luck guys at the sale um beautiful beautiful car uh seven out of ten another 200 sx this one's on the pricey side especially since it's got a 1.8 liter the ci 18 det and it's got a t4 t3 turbo with some slightly bigger inject well a lot bigger injectors i think it came with 300 and something cc's now it's got 750s it's got a 10 inch sub and an amp and a reverse camera so that's pushed the price up to 140k damn horrific wheel have we seen this car we've seen this car that thing and the fake gauges my apologies for showing a car again but um yeah 140k will make an offer i'm not going to mention my offer right then a buddy of mine 1224 in cape town um

(Start: 00:22:28)
he sent me a few things so first of all he sent me this it's a 300 zx with a 1jz na turbo it's got all the stuff in it four button clutch search tanks two fuel pumps prices negotiable the government's 48 000 ran here's the car it looks like it's sitting i'm pretty certain it's sitting at the rock raceway so that car is one of the rock raceway cars there's a 34 and says rock racing um yeah i don't know what the story is yeah but it's a project car and it's it's a low price for project car that is relatively built already you could probably just get in throw on a bumper button up a couple things and use attention to body and engine needs to be wide and pop okay so you've got a lot of work to do but the price is good and it's negotiable then this one i have to mention it is likely sold already it's an r32 gtr silver just like mine okay mine's not

(Start: 00:23:30)
blue it's blue plastic the one silver underneath okay this particular one has the stock bumper okay mine's got the in one bumper in one rear all that sort of stuff um so this one's stock but it's got a big single turbo conversion right big single table it's got oil catch can way better oil catch again what i've got decent radiator setup aluminium radio he's retained the viscous fan he's got um he's got a boost controller and i think that boost controller is connected to the ec unlike mine mine standalone he's making 280 wheel kilowatts on 1.1 bar of pump fuel here's the thing the price he wants 415 000 red which is by far the cheapest gt-r i have ever seen i'm not ever seen but i have seen in the last three years by far the cheapest he actually mentions

(Start: 00:24:30)
that possibly the best price no dude it is he then dropped the price to 400 000 3 days later right 400k if you have to go and buy a probably worse spec than this that's already got the twin turbos and things are like not running so lacquer you're probably looking at about 560 to 580 000 rent the cars that are still here they haven't made it to market level process with japan not yet the cars that are in south africa right now that are selling the jdm cars they are cheaper than if you had to buy in japan and that is the truth i've been looking i look at auctions every single day i know my prices that being said beautiful if someone can jump on this if it's not sold already you grab yourself a gtr for 400k i don't know what's wrong with it anything wrong with it it looks like an urgent cell maybe he's relocating who knows um try and grab it somebody try and grab this car beautiful this is by far my favorite and

(Start: 00:25:32)
i'm going to give this a 9 out of 10. and that is the end of the video lots of cars that we just went through a lot of cool stuff on there i'm happy to find any jdm cost to be honest sometimes i log on and there's absolutely nothing and then i'll log in a week later and i'll find like 10 vehicles and i'm like right that's when i'm going to be filming so thank you for joining me on this ride i'll be doing some r33 content again uh pretty soon in the next two three days you guys will have another video so thank you so much for watching i'll see you all next one peace

Title: Project R33 - Rear End Dismantle And Cleanup

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] [Music] so [Music]

(Start: 00:01:10)
do [Music] [Music] that is looking so much better uh just a little bit of clean green and uh what we call it pot scarer steel wool steel i think what i'm going to do is

(Start: 00:02:11)
i'm going to take off this trim but not now it's just it'll be easier if it's not on the car but the rest of it is looking damn fine one of the problems that i'm having is a lot of the ground is running down i want to take off these lots at least one lot let's see what's behind it i think i'm going to take the taillights out a little bit later uh there were a couple nuts that i removed and i threw on the top there somewhere over there but i believe that there's some like black glue gunk that holds the rear see there all this here so you need to use a heat gun or hair dryer warm that up and then we'll pry up and i'm going to do that because i need to clean up all the around and i want to take a bumper off clean it all

(Start: 00:03:12)
up i'm going to slowly start putting stuff together i've got some exciting news for the front end but we'll keep that for another time [Music] okay three nuts on the back there like that side and i can get the bumper [Music] just as i thought so there's three nuts back here they're all finger tight i think the previous owner did remove these nuts and he had the bumper

(Start: 00:04:13)
off i don't remember i think it was this bumper actually i asked him if he could put the bumper back on because the carrier might complain about loose parts in the car lots of space an issue so these guys need a bag and tag these nothing living under there that's great red sand everywhere in a dead bee b that's just a big ass end not a b you guys seriously found this interesting because i put a i put a thing out in my last video and i said you guys want me to film all this stuff um and

(Start: 00:05:15)
10 of you guys more maybe more i said please please let's see us i'm going to be a big editor it doesn't make me work hit that like button oh by the way if you're wondering why i'm talking like a bit of an s because i've got a mask on i've got someone cutting the grass for me this is a weird-ass gunk on here it's definitely from the red sand and it's just hardened and it's caused like some i don't know i don't know what the right word for it is [Music]

(Start: 00:06:24)
look how easy this comes off with steel wool you just got to go lightly over it so you don't freak off any paint i'm not putting a lot of pressure and it's just beautifully coming off remember to keep the area nice and moist [Music]

(Start: 00:07:42)
me [Music] [Music] what up boys the next day i did pretty well with the bum cleaning yesterday i had about an hour to work so i'm doing the stuff before i go to work in the mornings uh early morning like six a.m ish and uh yeah i'm getting quite a bit done and i noticed something yesterday i took a picture for my instagram and i think this car had a rear end smash i mean nothing's serious but take a look quickly this has been

(Start: 00:08:44)
knocked in can you guys see that that piece i mean this is easy to sort out i can just pull that back i don't have enough force on my fingers but i can i can pull it back so a couple of thoughts last night but i wanted to do some gauges i just want to go take a look this my fescue in here where the radio is supposed to be and everything else i'm thinking i'm gonna put a piece of masonite in there there's some sort of backyard probably the masonic cut holes and whatnot and then i'm going to do some some stuff i mean this is i'm really jumping the gun here what i should be doing but i figured i've got all this cool i might as well make some use of it so i'll likely go for hk's evc boost controller throw that one in probably this one not the older one because i've got the i've

(Start: 00:09:45)
got the display for it right over here we could probably do a turbo timer in there as well keep it keep it matching i've got a super old-school hk's tip of like samara 90s late 80s and then i've got gauges i don't know i think maybe i'll just i'll draw this out design it see what i want to do there's a blitz exhaust temperature gauge uh gritty turbo actually this gritty tube is a nice one for today very nice oh actually i could throw in we've got the whole thing for this hk is old school hks oil is this temple pressure oil temperature it's actually generic

(Start: 00:10:47)
there's just a stick on here this is oil from japan and this one what's this another this is a blitz water temp that's cool i mean i can go to town here with all this crap that i've been collecting over the years oh this one's nice i think i think we've got a winner here we go for the two blitz ones blissboo blitz boost gauge this thing is so neat it's like almost brand new i picked this up as a junk piece it still works there's no issues with it it was anodized blue or painted blue rather i just cleaned it up some acetone i mean look at that that is so clean and then maybe this water template and then if i really want to standardize and everything i do have a blitz boost controller somewhere in this pile of junk and i've got a blitz dumbfold i can always throw into the rb20 at some stage

(Start: 00:11:48)
anyway back to cleaning [Music] uh guys i'm gonna interrupt this r33 video because it is time to start my rx-7 my big single turbo silver rx-753s [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:12:50)
so [Music] [Music] okay i've got something irritating me [Music] [Music] so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to take a little out of here and then try and figure out what's all in here what's supposed to be in [Music] here [Music]

(Start: 00:14:09)
[Music] [Music] [Music] all right boys i'm gonna end the video here there's gonna be a part two the party will be cleaning up the back uh i don't know i might dry ice it let's

(Start: 00:15:10)
see how it goes i'm definitely going to respray the back i'm going to get these tail lights out clean up everything behind it i just don't want this to be a too long of a video it's already been crazy long but you guys wanted to see the work you guys want to see the work being put on i'm doing this a couple days at a time i've only got like an hour or two like i think i said earlier in the video i don't know i do this very early mornings 6 a.m and that sort of stuff before work anyway we got a lot of work to do here oh i've got a lot of cleanup to do too all right guys thanks so much for watching i'll see you all next one peace you

Title: Finding GT-R's and other JDM Cars through Google Maps!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DzCLUdSyGk

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to the green screen yeah okay i'm in miami yeah green screen uh anyway i had this amazing video idea i don't think it's been done before or at least not in this fashion but i am going to be looking for jdm cars on google maps at really cool places like hks b racing beer whatever you want to call it we can just try find jdm cars so i found eight destinations if you guys want to see more of this hit the like button make sure you subscribe let me know in the comment section if you want to see more and i'll do a part two of this video so kicking it off we're gonna go to the uk an area called wingate there's a place called the gtr shop i believe they changed their name recently to the gtr heritage something heritage museum i think now this place they've got two top secret vehicles i've got a 33 top secret and they've got a r35 top secret mind blowing like the original one you

(Start: 00:01:00)
know the gold ones so we're just gonna head down the road here and let's see what we've got okay that's not even jdm come on i have vetted these just by the way so i'm not wasting my time with the video but look what we've got here sneaky 34 right there i don't know what that is i think it might be another 34 is it it's 32 and that i don't know and this there's something i mean that looks just as bad as my 33 sitting in the driveway there's a nice 33 over here i think it could be a sabon front bumper it's got uh sorry uh bonnet front bumper is the same as mine on my gtr and he's got a 33 sitting here but i'm pretty sure these are all customer cars they do they do work um i believe they've got a dyno here they they do engine rebuilds they do all sorts another 33 in there 34. there's a shell of some sorts here

(Start: 00:02:03)
what is that that a 34 i think that's a 33 there's is 32. i mean this place is just little gtrs that is 32. this one's a little bit screwed and what's down the road a truck or bucky if you're from south africa boring boring boring that's our first one some decent jdm oh here we go gtr shop japanese car specialist so now that the gtr heritage center or museum i forget moving on we're going to find  performance parts and they are also in the uk look at that what do you see straight away boom wrx sti i think this might just be a wrx and not an sti but uh either way it's cool it's a nice gc8 we've got over here we've got a blob eye we've got a forester we've got a hawkeye and then i think

(Start: 00:03:06)
that's a mercedes and a bmw i see a snatch i see a gtr r35 though so this is jet performance parts in the uk i think they're just they're pot strippers if i'm not mistaken oh i didn't see that earlier says sylvia no it's a d4 the wing threw me off there's something something sneaky over here i don't know what that is in the back that little white one tell me what you guys think that is the 34 there's some more subarus hawkeye hawkeye wrx hawkeye sti i like to take a look across the road you know there might be overflow parking or i don't know how far down i'll go but ah you see what's that another subaru that looks

(Start: 00:04:07)
like a blob eye yep it's a good old blob time attack nice what's that what else is down here jag bm there's a civic not a type are there so we're looking good we found some decent cars hey miata hello look how tiny it is next to these two cars what is this a box or foxhole insignia all right there's a little civic for you boys all your honda guys my favorite here is is this gotta be that looks like a version theory maybe version four and then there's obviously the 34 chilling over here i think yeah obviously it's more expensive but i think i'll probably take the gc8 i really really really miss them i'll say this almost next up we're going to jump all the way across the pond to japan

(Start: 00:05:08)
partner in nagoya this is the place where i picked up both my rx-7s from well they at least did the import exporting from japan for me they're based in nagoya they've got a 1.6 star review i didn't go take a look apparently someone was impersonating and just trying to bring down their name uh i kind of don't see anything other than that and this dude with a cigarette he's like royally confused chick he's even got a mask i wonder if this was recent or was it just japan with the masks okay am i going in the right direction must be a c i see a type what is that i see a type r this is a legit type i check it's even gonna exhaust i see something oh that looks like a hatchback subaru see they do pots as well park stripping and all that there's a i was in secretary it's a harlax surf

(Start: 00:06:08)
i've never seen one of those so check this out a little bit further down the road this is the outdoor lot and i believe my car was sitting out in this lot all my cars but look how there's a 32 there's a 33 that looks like a forrester supra camry supra 34 that's mad this is this is where they come from guys this is their home [Music] look at that look at that beauty old gf8 wagon i can't get any closer if you look at my little little dude over here there's no there's no other road what a pity now we're going to shoot back to south africa i was going to do nx gen but i couldn't find anything google maps maybe i just didn't look hard enough but i saw

(Start: 00:07:09)
something at rob green motorsport rob green is situated in joburg somewhere uh i have been there like years and years and years ago so they've got their famous rgm uh supercharged 86 actually got the power rating on the side somewhere there we go 220 kilohertz 350 newton meters i remember that from the speed and sound and then there is this s2000 doesn't that look sick that is cool one i love one in yellow just like this anyway that's that there's no other jdm cars here whatsoever so moving on to three to six power in hiroshima now these are tuners they pot supplies and tuners i see it here check this out look at that how cool are these some

(Start: 00:08:11)
86s gtrs for you badge boys audi's if you don't know what purges the vw audi golf had to think about that one but anyway we didn't come in for that crap look at this how epic is this achi roko 86 let us say jdm moving on to the final three this place called kuruma imports and it's in the united states and uh i'm actually honestly surprised that the the google truck van whatever drove right in so okay so look at this here's here's the road and then it kind of goes into here this looks like private property so there's across the neon so you wouldn't think there's anything else in

(Start: 00:09:12)
here right i mean you don't see anything else let's take a quick drive around the corner i bet the guy was like oh let me do a u-turn and then he's like what is that and he drives a little bit further and he's like holy that's a 33 and that's a midnight purple 33 with an hk super powerful exhaust and then he's like oh my god this isn't this in heaven yeah that's cool another 33 right there and then a supra and then the the [Music] let's see if there's anything in there is there something in there oh city google camera anyway this is kuruma imports in the united states and then moving on to our final two this one's in chiba japan look at that top secret how cool is

(Start: 00:10:13)

Title: PROJECT R33 BUDGET DRIFT BUILD - UPDATE VIDEO
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIEmTEx6XQ8

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys welcome back to the video i've been working on the r33 quite a bit of stuff has been happening off cam i've it's been like a mix of things i've been doing a lot of the stuff on the balcony while my daughter's playing so i don't really want to pick up the camera and film because well invasion of presidency and all that so whatever i've been doing i've been trying to recover the dash that's been an absolute fail remember i've never done this before ever i've just watched you tutorials on youtube and read a whole bunch of stuff from google i'm trying to do the whole hair dryer thing heating it up using gin chem contact adhesive glue i've got leather vinyl i've cleaned it up nasty i filled it up with foam i did show you guys in the previous video but it's just difficult especially just doing it by myself um anyway i'm gonna carry on trying what's the worst that i'm gonna be wasting we'll be wasting a little bit of glue i'm gonna be wasting a little bit of vinyl or leather vinyl i'm getting a learning experience here i'm figuring things out so uh i was a little bit bleak with myself for like a

(Start: 00:01:00)
day and then i've decided you know what if i don't try i'm never gonna know and uh if you don't fail you're not gonna try again you're not gonna succeed does that make sense i don't i'm gonna try again i'll show you the dash in a second before i carry on i just realized i got bed head i just came straight after and started working on the car um i ran a pretty crazy live stream a couple days ago we raided a bunch of youtubers a bunch of smaller youtubers guys who needed our help and i just want to say thank you to every single one of you guys who participated because i know that we have changed people's lives in some way or another even if it's just making them smile for one second if that's what we accomplished then that's awesome if there was anything more maybe the google algorithm youtube algorithm picked up that there were so many comments and i don't know if it's not recommending the videos that would be an even more of a plus but uh just one smile would have been fine and i know we got it we got it out of a couple of the guys and there were a few people that were really thankful that being said um i am running a raffle

(Start: 00:02:01)
at the moment it's closing in the next two three days depending on when this video comes out hopefully i get to edit it tonight and put it out tonight and uh the rifle is this so basically a hot wheels re7 a miata it's a pullback car one of those this jdm sticker another sticker this is an r33 gtr it's a pullback car as well sealed r32 gtr pullback car sealed little samurai dude figurine and then this if you win and you're from south africa i'll throw this in as a bonus prize okay all together if you're from south africa if you're not and you win you just get all other cool so the story for that is there's a link in the description of the stream labs link you can use paypal you can use credit card 50 bucks will get you an entrance into the raffle and all the money all the proceeds go towards the r33 project car there she is

(Start: 00:03:03)
i was actually just about to do the rear quarter window and uh decided let me just google a couple pictures see what it actually looks like complete and uh a little bit bleak about something i can't do it right now oh it's starting to drizzle but notice that let me close this thing up um the issue is i'm missing the trim that goes around here so i contacted the previous owner and he's kind of got it on his other 33 at the moment which is a little bit because uh i wanted to close this up because i've got any spiders and all sorts of things going inside the car at the moment um i guess what i'm going to do is just close it up with some cardboard for now uh he has promised to send it off to me as soon as he gets this car back it's sitting with the mechanic at the moment and it kind of needs the glass anyway here's a piece of polycarb gary came and dropped this polycarb off i cut it with my dremel i threw one of these diamond uh grinding stone thingies

(Start: 00:04:04)
they're really really good it cuts with poly card like cheese a lot of people say use metal cutting discs and all that that was amazing i used i did use one initially and i think i did just cut at the bottom with that and it just took forever i then used this diamond one and geez it was just cutting through cheese anyway this is a bit bigger it's not cut to size i was looking for those panels i don't have them now i'm a little bit screwed so i gotta wait and then i had um and then i had uh rushiel kissoon posting in the comments um that i kind of kind of baited everybody about not showing the steering wheel that i recovered in the last video and sorry about that i just completely forgot to film it i did mention the last video that i've recovered and i'll show you guys later in the vlog and i never did so anyway here it is this was completely screwed if you look at the previous pictures it was messed the airbag was sticking out all that stuff like i didn't really film it um yeah like i said a lot of stuff was happening on the balcony but i recovered this whole section it's yeah i mean you know you can't see the

(Start: 00:05:05)
nissan logo properly anymore you can't see the thing that says srs airbag over here but it is looking a hell of a lot better and it's not functional i can use this temporarily until i get a sparkle or momo or something cool plus i've got a collection of stock steering wheels that can always go there when i'm done the next thing is the dash fescue okay so this little bit of an issue everything's an issue to that i've sat for i don't know three hours plus sanding the hell out of this filling it sanding again priming sanding it and there's just so much bloody damage on this can you guys see that i just i don't want to spend any more time on menial stuff this thing got burned this was bad bad bad sun damage look at that now it looked okay when i did the white primer but as soon as i spread black on it it was like everything just starts to

(Start: 00:06:06)
show so from far it looks great um i decided to put everything back in just to see how it looked and then decide what i'm going to be doing i'm not going to leave it like this what i've decided the easiest that would that i can actually do is to get one of those vht crinkle black paint just spray it over and then it's going to give it that crinkled look and then i don't have to worry about finish and all that sort of stuff it's going to be black it's still going to look awesome and that's it by the way to those who have said for the dash i should have flocked it i'm battling to find flocking powder here in south africa and flocking kits these guys who do sell it for model cars but in small quantities and it's and it's expensive and we can't import the flocking kits because of the chemicals also i've been told so a bit of a catch-22 and i've put out my feelers on instagram i've asked a bunch of people hey who can give me flocking stuff and i probably had 10 to 13 comments of people saying when

(Start: 00:07:07)
you find out please let me know because i'd like to do this to my car and then i've had two people tell me okay listen go try grumpy's model cars and then someone else a model car shop as well and it's just like like i said small quantities so i'm not gonna be flocking the dash not right now i'm gonna carry on with the vinyl let's go check it out this is the dash that i'm kind of not happy with the cap so i managed to get this done this thing looks okay it's not great but i think it was awesome i finished over here so here's where the huge gash was where the airbag exploded it's flat but i didn't get my angle right when i filled it up with firm it looks okay from that angle let me tell so you can see it's a bit shiny underneath here i'm not too worried about this sort of stuff like not an issue because well that's it okay but here's the shitboard i'm gonna get rid of these crinkles i don't know i i screwed up somewhere and i tried pulling it then i cut the material here so i didn't have enough materials to hide it

(Start: 00:08:09)
a bit of a cock-up like i said i failed i'm going to try again that i kind of got right except for this yeah i need to fill that up a little bit more firm so what i'm going to do this material is wasted it's it's screwed i need to carry on or i'm going to carry on i've decided forget about those i'm going to put this  back carry on so i can learn do it again it's not going to be right i'm going to rip it all off i don't know maybe in a month or two months and then do it again and then hopefully i'll have the experience and uh should get it right it should be a little bit better at doing these things that's the cock-up so far it looks tatty it looks i could probably send it in i don't know they'll probably charge a ground or something to recover the dash but i want to learn how to do it myself maybe pick up a new skill so whatever really lost while okay maybe a little bit of money well this was pretty cheap it was like 70 rand meets up or two meters some gen chem glue 50 60 bucks whatever i've gained the experience

(Start: 00:09:10)
that's all that matters i messed up i'm going to try again not now we're going to move on to other cool stuff in the car and i've decided i'm not going to put gauges here anymore i'm going to do the gauges on here so i'm going to build something afterwards with the gauges facing that way towards the driver's side right so the next thing i'm going to be doing with the car and i want to know from you guys do you want me to film this is this content that you actually want to see i don't know tell me in the comment section so i want to get down to the car with some clean green and and some scrubbing brushes and all that and clean all the grime everywhere obviously i would have cleaned this first before putting the window on let me show you on the boot side okay can you see this mess disgusting okay it carries on i did a little bit on this side okay see it's a lot cleaner like there that's all i did anyway i kind of did that in a couple of minutes

(Start: 00:10:11)
while just standing outside waiting for something and uh it looks a lot better but is this content that you guys want to see do you want to see me ripping everything off the boot cleaning all this up and then i want to hit it with some uh i've got something called brewery rust let me show you so this stuff brew rust says destroys rust and protects iron it's a rust converter basically i've got this i was uh wanting to clean up a lot of the surface rust and then i've got i've got rust on on panels so the underneath of the car actually looks okay it's very dirty it doesn't need to clean up but it's a little bit of surface rust over there things like that there's a piece over here you know small stuff it's nothing nothing serious at all oh that's actually just sand lucky me like that okay is that concept you guys

(Start: 00:11:13)
want to see because i mean i can do a time lapse in that sort of this is this is just dirt i thought that was rust there's rust and then i want to rip this bumper off and just clean everything so personally i think this costs that in on in the desert somewhere and there was just sand blowing on it all the time you see that underneath the car actually let's see if i can get you guys under did you guys see that muddy dirty and then this support bar the dash clean that up rust proof it all that i don't know it kind of just feels weird

(Start: 00:12:14)
filming like that so i'm gonna make an effort i'm gonna end the vlog now i'm gonna try and edit asap and then throw this video up you guys let me know if that's something that you guys want to see just cleaning up the car taking all the  out and then i'll do something tomorrow another video i guess anyway that's it for the video thank you so much for watching i'll see you on the next one peace

Title: PROJECT R33 BUDGET DRIFT BUILD - The Interior
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaY6LY5NftY

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] bye what up boys welcome to the vlog i put it out to you guys on youtube on instagram on tick tock and i asked you guys to let me know what i should do with the interior of the r33 project car and it was kind of loud it was unanimous everybody said rebuild okay not everybody there were a lot of people who said just strip it i am however gonna be rebuilding it i've already started take a look started spraying some stuff i started sanding some stuff some primer work happened i bought some foam uh like some spray foam because i'm gonna be filling stuff i need to film the airbag cover fill not film and then i picked up some vinyl so there's some vinyl leather and i've got some jenkins glue and you know heat gun all that stuff it's going to be

(Start: 00:01:02)
awesome i'm going to redo the entire dash the airbag cover i'm going to build some gauges into it 60 mil gauges because you know i'm kind of not short on any gauges the steering wheels out i'm gonna because i've never done the vinyl thing before i'm actually gonna try and repair this but i'll probably not use it in the car and i'll probably throw i mean there's a stock steering wheel as you can see i don't do stock steering wheels but i'm going to try and repair it just so i know what i'm doing and i've bought this foam filler spray thing and i'm going to close this thing up and then i'm going to do a vinyl wrap on it with vinyl leather see how that goes and i'm gonna move on to the dash because i've never done it before i've seen youtube videos and all that sort of stuff but once you start doing it with your hands different ballgame hell of a mess here i've been focusing so much on the car and project car anyway here's the rb20 that's uh going into the r32 a lot of people thought i was going to be throwing in an rb26 for some reason here's my 26. this stays and it's going

(Start: 00:02:04)
to live in this car is 132 gtr if you to the channel this is my rb20 it's not an rb20e this is the legit rb20de don't believe me there's the intake manifold and the turbo is not that one i don't know where the tube is in one of these boxes oh look 34 gtr side mirror does not fit 33. anyway i gotta go write a few names on 32. so this is how i do it i pull up my message requests stuff that i haven't clicked on yet and then i found the first one that's got to do with that particular thing so for example like this guy's asking me if i want to sell my rx7 unfortunately no sorry dude and then this one see he subscribed cool so i'll write his name p u j a and then i accept

(Start: 00:03:06)
and then i try to send a picture that looks somewhat decent and i've been doing this for each and every person at least uh i didn't do it for this first set yeah unfortunately i didn't think there were going to be this many names and that's this much love for what i'm doing so i i don't know i didn't send these people their names i'm so sorry and such a mission there's like 3 000 names on the car now anyway i've got another 70 to go much much much later probably wondering why i've got a mask on uh i've got a gardener here helping out it's got to be safe and before i begin let me show you guys if you're following my instagram you would have known that i used some expanding foam on this airbag cover he's a little bit more of a full and it leaves a little bit more of a sand and then the shape is going to be just right

(Start: 00:04:07)
and then i've got my polycarb here i've already done the template and all that sort of stuff steering wheel i recovered last night i'll show you guys a little bit later [Music] there it is boys dash is out i thank you okay nice to see what i'm working [Music]

(Start: 00:05:08)
with this uh vlog is all over the place i'm sorry look at that whole full thing and i've been sanding it down it's actually looking pretty decent so i mean you guys saw there was a massive hole here this little bust as well also i just need a fuller and then here i need to sort the shape out so this is the airbag cover that's a oh there's like some bolts that you tighten underneath so it basically sits something like that i just need to eat away a little bit more over here push it back slightly and then i've got it nicely in line with that and then flatten flatten this is already flat and then fill a little bit more and then i can cover and then obviously sand down and flatten the only reason i put all this extra stuff in here is because when i was peeling the vinyl off a lot of it came off a lot of the foam and i just i wanted you know i wanted to keep the same

(Start: 00:06:09)
same height and all that stuff i don't want a little dense when i when i'm laying down the vinyl so this is the ship part of my house which i haven't been able to finish yet these uh l22 blocks actually supposed to be at the bottom and i was gonna extend this whole thing but i haven't brought any workers because of the coronavirus and all that jazz silva rx-7 black mr2 hasn't been started in a little while i'm gonna start it up now at least this car is nice and clean oh battery

(Start: 00:07:11)
[Music] so a little bit dark on that note i'm going to end the vlog it's been um it's been a lot of sanding and a lot of molding and trying to get things right that stuff that's very boring to film and put on cam you guys seen what i'm doing it's time consuming super boring the next episode is going to be a lot i promise there's some cool happening with the car i'm gonna film it

(Start: 00:08:11)
all we'll let this car run for another 15 minutes or so i need to take a quick drive in the next few days drop the rx7 i'll be coming back with some r33 content soon the g2 already takes photographers that being said if you guys can see me thank you so much for watching um

Title: ABANDONED R33 - Project Budget Drift - PART 1 - What's in the R33?
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihbgNKzHFvc

(Start: 00:00:00)
what up boys welcome to day one of work on this call i'm gonna try and do an inventory check figure out what's in the car you guys are gonna see what's in there i gave it a both and i've put in some uh sanitizing defogger thing just so it kills all the germs [Applause] so there's a lot of crap in this corner i need to kind of do an inventory and figure out what's what's what then gary was fun enough to drop off the lexan glass lexan glass

(Start: 00:01:03)
so this is handy previous owner put everything in ziploc bags labelled it trunk mechanism etc etc very cool bracket for lock lock bracket or something indicator i thought i had to buy one of these from japan luckily i didn't i pretty much stripped out the inside of the car all this stuff was just lying around a lot of it doesn't belong to the inside of the car and i want to just keep all the insides more inside cigarette butts very dirty i found some license plates i found a license just from 2014 that's cool boot is in the shambles i'm going to tackle this later there were a couple interior bits that were in here i've taken them out like the glove box and a few other things i've taken them out we'll figure this out later i'm going to throw the hard lines that sort of stuff in there because well i'm running out of space then let me know what you guys think i was and i initially said like let's do a drift missile and i don't know i'm thinking about having a

(Start: 00:02:03)
semi-clean interior i've got all the interior bits i'm thinking about putting all the interior back together maybe just lose the back seats maybe lose the carpet um do some dry ice on the floor but at least have the dash have a complete dash have some door cards in and the only reason i say this is uh i'm sure all of you guys watch samut overseas in japan australia slash australia um he's got that chaser that he that he drifts and that car's got a full interior and he's got the gauges on the dash and the passenger side i'm thinking about doing the same thing but i i want a complete dash i'm thinking about a complete dash but you guys let me know in the comments so i'm thinking retained a dash obviously that's a problem i'm thinking from this line here so from here plus minus have this recovered so this section is completely bust from there so have it recovered over here i could probably do that myself i figure that out and then run my gauges three or four gauges over here with like a slight angle so i can see them from let's say i was sitting over here

(Start: 00:03:04)
right gauges over there i think that'll look pretty cool steering wheel's cooked uh i've got steering wheels there we'll still sort that out i'm gonna actually take out the center piece so it doesn't look so so shite that's a good sign there's no rats here a lot of spider webs but no rats so the stupid airbag thing it's got normal nuts over here and then that the hell am i supposed to do with that thing that

(Start: 00:04:09)
problem solved oh i've got a lot of work in this car okay i'm thinking i'm gonna get this surround out oh wow this is a deep hole that just [Music] better cover that up so doesn't come inside the car okay i want to get this trim out because i do get quite a bit of time where i can just sit on the balcony and watch my kids play while they're playing i can fix like this and then i'll do off cam i believe these are all clips

(Start: 00:05:10)
all the clips done [Applause] i'm going to take this dash cluster out not i think i am and the reason why i'm gonna do it is because i need to take the dash out so this needs to come out actually all this needs to come out steering wheel i've got a bit of a problem it's got the same stupid locks it's like a spline type thing almost but not so it was a little bit tricky to get off it's about three minutes or so i'll show you why okay so here's your normal standard plugs where you just put pressure on one

(Start: 00:06:10)
side and you pull it here's another one but then it's got these see it's got on both sides so you've got actually put pressure on both sides here and then yank it out there were two of those so the black one was the one that was an issue and i was sitting in the corner there there wasn't much space anyway it's out i'm gonna label all these screws put them in ziploc bags just like the previous owner did and just like i've been doing the rb20 pretty cool and then we're gonna get this dash out i'm gonna say it again but what do you guys think about having this that was cool i have the dash pretty much complete door panels driver's seat rear seats out floor out floor matting out

(Start: 00:07:11)
or should i just go full balls to the wall and rip everything look at out that's the top of the dash we both said something earlier about the rats being in the car what is that yeah this is old at some stage there's probably rats super snack i wash my hands you

(Start: 00:08:19)
sour plum made in china i need to get this all stripped out and and cleaned that's disgusting okay we're looking better so it looks like the only thing that i'm really missing is a gt badge that's really it i've already found some in japan they look they're cheap 90 150 rand original ones secondhand obviously i think i might end this vlog now i think i'm gonna end the vlog i've actually i've spent quite a lot of time um well categorizing and doing a little inventory etc off-cam stuff and i kind of have a plan now plan of action so i can actually prepare these videos make them longer make them more entertaining today was just figuring out about the car the previous video of revealing this car

(Start: 00:09:21)
well that was the longest i spent other than right now i did push the car around with some help and gave it a bath and that was it other than that i haven't opened it up so today was a day of just exploring that being said i'm so excited that i've got this that i've got content now that i can do this build and we're going to do it together so i want your guys input so let me know about the interior and then i'm going to start asking you questions in the next video what color we're going to do what are we going to do what sort of turbo we're going to throw on the engine yeah again thank you so much for watching we'll see you in the next one peace

Title: REVEALING MY NEW JDM PROJECT CAR!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkXLVzf3ms

(Start: 00:00:00)
so we're at that point now where the car is actually yeah it's right in front of me it's it's just it's so crazy how does this all happen i'm going to do the reveal in a sec but they're just something that you need to know so first of all this car was supposed to be picked up earlier in the week we're now on sunday it was supposed to be picked up on wednesday that didn't happen it fell through it got picked up on friday and then on friday i thought it was going to arrive on monday which is tomorrow and i got a surprising phone call from the car carrier saying listen your car is blocking short story rather your car is blocking all the others because the non-runner i don't know if i told you guys that i did i'm throwing in that rb20 det it's a non-runner it's blocking all the other cars it'll make sense to drop yours off first i was like okay cool uh on monday no in 20 minutes that was yesterday saturday holy crap so i had to rush get a tow truck and everything to get it here it's in front of me second thing is remember that scene in

(Start: 00:01:01)
the fast and furious the first fast and furious when brian o'connor or brian earl spillner at the time brings the supra the crashed out burnt supra on the trailer and uh he says to vin diesel this is your 10 second car and uh he had no faith in him and then jesse saw and it was like 2jz no and that's become an internet meme or sensation whatever you want to call it this is that moment i believe i am brian dom and jesse all in one 2021 is to be a year of change and this is either going to be my drift missile or my track slash or the cross car let's go [Music]

(Start: 00:02:09)
[Applause] okay this is it boys it's my r33 gts this is um like i said going to be a drift missile or autocross car and it's going to give me free roam of doing whatever the hell i want to this car without losing a lot of market value and while just throwing it into a wall i'll get into the damage in a sec and i'll show you guys around um but yeah i mean i i feel bad throwing the the 32 and the rx-7 especially if something happens and i crash it i'm not going to be able to afford to to rebuild especially in current times with with the baby at home and my daughter and yeah covered not being so friendly to us okay so let's talk about the car it looks like a hunker junk but it's got good bones it's got potential there's a barking dog next door i'm sorry about that so let's start with the front end of this car i actually have the fenders that belong to it it's on the inside of the car i can see one fender there the other one's tucked away somewhere there so the fenders are here

(Start: 00:03:10)
it had a front-end smash now allegedly it rolled down the bank and it crashed into a gate i don't think that's true i'll tell you why okay possibly like yeah it could have happened but something i don't understand is that we'll come back to the front if you look here the airbag was deployed rip the steering wheel airbag deployed on that side too break the dash airbags will only deploy and i might be wrong here maybe someone who knows the 33s better don't your airbags only deploy if there's pressure on the seat and your seat belt is actually plugged in so does that mean it rolled down the bank with people in it and they were going at high speed i don't know anyway it is salvageable and this is gonna be the first time that i'm actually popping the it wow that's a heavy beast okay so you know strut strut towers don't have any rust on them that's

(Start: 00:04:10)
really good because that is a common issue on the the chassis is straight subframe or the cradle here for the engine everything is fine everything is good it's just obviously this is a little bit mangled so i'm thinking about doing a popped front end or at least some sort of some sort of a support the bonnet's pretty screwed i don't think i'm gonna be able to repair that i mean it's yeah i'll probably just rust treat it and see if i can never know there's there's some pretty bad crinkle over here so there was uh definitely some hard impact that sorted that out now the impact also caused damage here because these went into the glass and it kind of just shattered that'll probably get replaced with like sand um i don't know if that's a good idea on the windscreen i have seen people do it

(Start: 00:05:11)
but yeah i'll see that quarter glass is getting replaced probably this week my mate gary he's got that black mx-5 you guys seen before in the videos he's going to come by and drop off a piece of lexan glass which hopefully i can get cut to size i need to clean up all this mess so anyway the car does have a full interior it's all in pieces though it's been it's been taken out obviously i don't need that i'm gonna be trying to keep it down as much as i can with weight i'm not too worried about the dash either so the dash is okay from like this side to there i don't really care about that i can i'm gonna recover that and i'm probably gonna put some gauges in there facing this way i don't know i don't know just yet but all the panels are here all the trimmers here steering wheel not concerned i've got other steering wheels to throw on got a key for the car yeah obviously dead and then a lot of trim in here and what we're going to do the first episode is kind of just get everything out

(Start: 00:06:13)
organize it see what's missing see what's here and then make an inventory of what i need what i want to do what i want to accomplish some timelines and then yeah go from there these wheels will obviously not be on the car it does have brakes on it which is great they are disconnected there's no engine oh the abs has been taken out um yeah so that uh that's a good thing there are brakes for now and there's full suspension shocks that works and the rear of the car is pretty complete so it's got the tail lights there's some lot cracking over here kind of looks like sun damage actually and then i was a bit i was a bit worried at first because the skyline this thing uh the garnish the rear garnish wasn't on the car initially but i'll end up finding it yesterday i mean this is actually the longest time

(Start: 00:07:14)
that i've spent with the car just being in this video i mean filming right now uh yesterday i had about five minutes of the car which was really sucked you know you get something new and you wanna you wanna touch it you wanna play with it i do need to sanitize my hands because uh i think this could possibly give me more than coronavirus but um it's got good burns it really does and i'm pretty stoked with what i picked up especially for the price it needs a good spray we'll we'll get to that i mean the spray and and all that stuff will be like one of the last things that will happen and uh yeah like i said i want to just do an adventure of all the stuff i see there's a spare fuse box there's another one tucked around that side um just trying to figure out what's here what's missing what i need and what i need to strip out carpets will obviously come out probably get some dry start cleaning up all the sound deadening

(Start: 00:08:14)
and then i need to do some sort of rust treatment soon i've got this stuff called brew rust i think i'm throwing that on and then some 2k primer just to protect the car because well i am in durban and i'm close to the sea so there's gonna be rust so it's a hell of a project that's gonna be a hell of a lot of work but it's also a content creator and it allows me to engage with you guys because there's a new project that you guys can all follow from the beginning for example my my rx-7 when it arrived from japan that was awesome because you guys got to follow it from the beginning we got to enjoy the car it broke or when it came here it wasn't running properly we fixed it we then the single turbo conversion and all that sort of jazz and uh well we're gonna start on this new project and you know i'm going this route because like i said i want to track drift and do whatever but also i've reached the point now where the r32 gtr i can't do much more to it in this current state other than go big single turbo and that's just you know huge money

(Start: 00:09:16)
finances um on so i mean yeah i'm surviving and i'm able to feed the kids and all that stuff rx-7 i'm at a point now where all i need to do is just tune black rx-7 and the mr2 are going to stay stuck forever so there's no there's no content here's my content we're going to work on this together you guys are going to tell me what i should do what i shouldn't do and we'll go from there and it does have that barrel with the whole listen thing that flips so i just need to find it somewhere in the car oh here it is that's the one i mean we can piece this card together it is missing a bumper in the front and i don't have headlights i have found some headlights in japan um i've decided all i'm going to do is outside of this right hand side so right hand side left hand side i'm going to do a ducted setup because obviously the intakes are on

(Start: 00:10:17)
that side or intake i'm gonna do a ducted setup there and then uh front mount intercooler i need to fix these supports rust treated do all that jazz so anyway that is the car i'm so glad you guys here for the ride thank you so much for the support i'll see you all next video peace oh

what's up guys and welcome to the channel we've had about 850 plus minus new subscribers in the last few days which is absolutely amazing you're mostly here because of what the title says the people's skyline now if you haven't been following on my tech talk on my instagram i've been writing everybody's usernames down on my skyline all over i've completely filled the bonnet the fenders the bumper it's going crazy i'm going to show you in a sec i know most of you are here to see your names see there it is in the background i'll get to it in a second if this is the first time you're joining my name is nelson i run this channel i've been running for about 400 years i collect jdm cars i collect jdm parts anything japanese pretty much not only do i collect stuff i love helping people out with regards to information on importing i've imported these cars myself i learned the process so i've posted this video on my channel called how to import jdm cars in south africa where i explain the entire process how much it costs etc and you know i'm just here to share

(Start: 00:01:00)
knowledge and and that's pretty much it i just want to help furthermore i'm trying to grow my channel so that i can fight i tech i tech is the international trade association and they basically decide on which vehicles are allowed into south africa and for example the innocent sylvia is 15 is not listed as a collector's item i want to fight them and i want to put up a petition but i need more people and hopefully i can get the channel to grow have a little bit more clout and then start taking on the big boys and start fighting because these cars are collectible the prices are rising that car has risen three times in value the gtr has gone up five six times in value from what it was you know it's it's an it's a touchy subject with them because they feel that it's killing the used car market and even the new car market here in south africa it's a long story you're not going to get into it there's a bunch of my jdm parts that i've been collecting you'll notice some new stuff if you guys

(Start: 00:02:01)
are og subscribers some stuff that has arrived recently i've got a lot of duplicates and crease controllers and i'm actually lining up this is a really old-school boost controller just by the way and something cool arrived gen 3 come on focus gen 3 turbo timer hks turbo timer most of the stuff actually works oh look at this super super super old turbo timer in the back there he remembers this brand need for speed five zigging i also have an rv20 det that i'm going to be throwing into a project car and then this beautiful gauge apexi mechanical 60mm this is going to go on the r32 gtr now this holder a pixie holder i picked up a gauge which one was it i think it was oh that's also nice guys that's a really clean blood sketch

(Start: 00:03:03)
it was this one this hks gauge was sitting on this apexi holder i got it from next to nothing i actually just picked up the gauge so i could get the holder now i'll throw the holder with the apexi [Music] moving on to the people's skyline before we get to the names it needs a wash excuse the interior ripped everything apart because i'm going to be fitting this gauge over here somewhere before we go on that's up i'm going to put a wide band over here and close this up we'll get to this in a sec we'll do a quick walk around on the car without further ado this is the people skyline [Music]

(Start: 00:04:12)
uh [Music] uh if you're wondering what's underneath the cover it's a 1997 rx-7 fd 3s black one might as well show you [Applause] it needs a bath it does and i was building a carport here but then covert happened and i stopped bringing workers to the house doing everything myself now you can just sweep okay so what is the people skyline i'm going to do a walkthrough i'm going to show you all the mods i'm going to talk about the car quickly for the ogs the guys who have been on the channel before you already know this i'm so sorry but 800 people have just joined that's like 20 of the channel almost i've got to explain the r32 before we get into it i still have another rx-7 not this one silver one i've done a huge single server conversion the car is

(Start: 00:05:14)
absolutely wild i just got it running and i drove it for the first time in two and a half years i'm parking it off because i'm waiting for two fuel pumps to arrive i've got a fuel filter i need to throw on as well so i'm working on the gto oil i'm getting sidetracked little names and the reason why we're doing this is because i wanted to give back it's plastic dipped so i've been writing all the names on it a lot of people and i'm talking a lot have either sworn at me told me i'm dumb i'm an idiot i'm stupid i'm ruining the paint there's plasti lip the car silver underneath there's nothing wrong with that i'm not ruining anything i'm gonna leave this plastic lip on until january the 1st 2022 these names will sit on the car for almost a year okay i'm going to be a dick and i'm not going to remove these names tomorrow it's not going to happen it is roughly pushing about 340 kilowatts um i had an official dyno at 303 on the wheels and that was a couple years ago and

(Start: 00:06:16)
turned up the boost and a couple other small minor modifications since then we're going to pop the bonnet in a second i've got an original grady trust intercooler this integrator is massive i've got the little in one lip thingy in the front i've got the i don't know if it's called the nismo bumper it might be with the little cutouts i forgot i have got tire wires these are federal some things i forgot 595 rs big fat 17s i've got that nisma n1 thing on the back as well sorry i should probably park the car a little bit more forwards and then exterior-wise i've got 10 coilovers on the car i haven't loaded like crazy because well my driveway is kind of so this is probably about as low as i can go the rx-7 is actually a little bit lower but

(Start: 00:07:16)
whatever kakimoto exhaust or at least the back box the rest of it is 88 mil that's three and a half inches all the way to the turbos there's two turbos and they're in one steel wheel turbos so i can i can throw the boost at them they're not the ceramic ones that are going to snap and break at any second um still running the twin setup which is cool stock plastic popping under you need to change that i've got hk super power flow intakes some custom piping that i did myself it is hard popped all the way to the front of the intercooler except for here but the rest is hot pop all the way and then hot pop over there gritty oil catch can then i've got some red radiator stuff on there aftermarket uh radiator i've got an original mines strap brace i wouldn't say this is rare but it's

(Start: 00:08:17)
very jdm 10 coilovers like i mentioned i've got a hks evc 5 there's a solenoid for it that's all plumbed in and then the plenum has been uh what do you call it stripped of its black paint apexy radiator cap it's really minor stuff i've deleted quite a few things batteries been relocated to the back i need to clean up this mess that's that's not good i still need to sort it out there's a relay in here for a switching fan uh my charcoal canister has been removed that's just the breather for it and then obviously all the right block of stuff for the oil catch can i've got a video on the oil catch can set up if you guys want to see if anybody wants to do it oh yeah and well you can't see but there's custom down parts 276 mil or three inch down parts going into 88 mil exhaust all the way through and the only silencer is the box then those big remorse or mess if you're not from africa um deleting that bunch of crap over

(Start: 00:09:18)
there because that's from an old digital boost gauge that i had i'm now going for the mechanical one here's the lead from the mechanical this needs to be pulled back and then looped somewhere neatly i have an apexy power fc with the hand controller here's my edge case abc with the screen there is a gradie turbo timer down there out of focus riser neochrome holder i've got say belt seat belts on the passenger side i didn't want to throw them on this side around deleted seats deleted rears for a little while but that's a back end now it's actually an original apexi holder if you can see there i think you can see the exi mymo race steering wheel original momo race steering wheel i mean it's a very very simplistic setup that i'm running however i've cranked up the boost and i've got all the supporting mods so it still makes some decent power

(Start: 00:10:18)
i forgot to mention the car is running on original these are not hong kong runs these are dirty full of spider webs the car is blocked off buddy club p1 rooms there are 17 by 9.5 js they look good it's simple i'm missing the wheel caps i need to buy those and that is that and obviously rb26 the heart of this whole operation i kind of feel bad to uh to river right now because i can hear the neighbors having a good time a little bit of a pool party and uh i just don't want to be a dick so yeah you can listen some raving i did the other day [Music] so all that being said that is my gtr that is my skyline i am now referring to

Title: Fuel Pump Resistor Rewire Fixed My RX7 FD3S
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=932hAfLrbGc

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to the video today we're going to be working on my rx-7 i want to do the fuel pump resistor rewire currently there's a resistor that's on that comes with all stock fd3s's and it limits the voltage going to the fuel pump and it limits the voltage at different rpms etc and uh basically it was there for emissions control back in the day also for longevity of the fuel pump we don't need that at all so i'm going to be removing that um i'm still running the stock fuel pump for now i'm going to be getting two wall bros uh pretty soon 320 liter per hours uh coming from japan and uh yeah get this car on the road so we're gonna start that off and let me show you what i have designed there was a youtuber called cole parker that i found somewhere in the states he's got an ft3s as well he did a rewire so i've used some of his documentation and i'm going to be doing my own little setup here so let me show you what i have in mind here is my relay which is this

(Start: 00:01:03)
this is a nice little relay harness that i've got set up here bosch relay blue let's just leave this right there so you can see all right so the blue wire is going to be going off to the battery it's going to be fused and then white will be ground black will be the fuel pump side so this is the actual fuel pump and then here this will be the sauce so what i'm going to do is i'm going to snip the source wire into here onto the yellow and then the other end of the fuel pump is going to go on to the black let's take this across the boot okay so there's his setup that i printed out and then i'll just drew mine so i can know where the colors are probably should just rip on there anyway um i managed to find this i'll pull this out so we're gonna just pull back the plastic and i'm gonna splice on this red and black wire and uh let's start on this fuel pump rewire right i figured i didn't want to bore you guys with filming just wiring i'm all done obviously i need to neaten up but here's the fused one which is running to

(Start: 00:02:04)
my battery 12 volts then i've splashed here on the harness and that's coming into the relay and then where are we we've got a ground running in here so here's the source one that's coming from the ecu and then this is the one that goes directly to the fuel pump off the harness and that's all reload so it's all going to be switchable and i should get full 12 volts to this fuel pump and then i just need to spend some time in eating all this up later i just didn't make it my son just went for a little morning nap he's only nine months old so he's gone for his morning nap this call will definitely wake him up um i'm gonna wait a little while but that means for you guys it's gonna happen pretty much right now before i cut over to that check this out started getting my color coding right finally sprayed my strut brace red black i think it looks pretty sick matches the turbo now all i need to do is change up that pipe for one of those black or red one i'm not sure which i'll probably just go for

(Start: 00:03:04)
a red dart and then it's not like a broken record but some stuff right from japan twin turbo pop for the r32 gtr very dirty one but i landed this i landed this for i think it was like 150 or 120 round bought it ages ago i bought this like end of september sent a slow mail so it cost absolutely nothing uh hk's term of time i came with it and what i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be doing that airflow thing all right i'm going to be cutting this piece across here if you look in there the airflow gets rather disrupted meaning there's airflow coming from this turbo and airflow coming from this side of the tube and there's a lot of turbulence in here so what people do is they cut this open here and they weld in a plate so there'll be a plate that separates this air and separates this air and makes it come in smoothly oh sorry this that's the real turbo this is the front turbo this is your

(Start: 00:04:05)
entry to the intercooler basically you're gonna create less turbulence so air is coming in it's hitting here a lot of turbulence and then it doesn't come out nicely over here so you want the float to be clean and separated so i'm going to be doing that it's a very common thing that guys do the twin turbos i just didn't want to do it on mine pops i'm going to clean this twin turbo pop up nicely and then do that mod and see what the power difference is like okay i'm back in theory this uh should be a little bit richer than what it was before but we'll see i'm not going to plug my laptop in now but this is unplugged because i got the fc hacker hey that's a flare but dodgy keeping it in the car oh copyright

(Start: 00:05:13)
good let's go i don't know if it's just me but i think my idol is a little bit leaner than what it used to be i probably should have plugged my laptop in whoops uh anyway i just tried going up the driver and it worked let's try again oh okay it's been about three four minutes my idol is starting to get a little bit richer which is good it used to be about 12 8 to 13. i expect now because the voltage it's actually getting full voltage now the fuel pump is working harder it

(Start: 00:06:14)
should be around the 12 6 to 12 8. let's see gotten up and down the driveway about four times everything seems clean up this okay [Music] ah i knew it twelve six twelve seven twelve five i just saw it never went below twelve nine twelve eight oops i don't know what that was about might be a little bit too rich not only

(Start: 00:07:22)
okay i need to see some data so i'm going to disconnect the fc haka and put in the fc hand controller oh we got what we got that a little bit warm i mean that's a good time so i've set my ac switch to activate both fans at anything above 65 degrees so that'll kick both my fans and hopefully it's on across your fingers

(Start: 00:08:28)
i should start dropping down see if i can get on my driveway so it's still rough it's it's a lot better though i mean going up the driveway before used to target like uh 17's 18 and then the this one wouldn't read anymore so it was leaning out big time so this this actually seemed to do the trick now i need to get those warblers and throw them in one more time cool a little bit rich there okay later i think i'm just gonna chuck the laptop back on

(Start: 00:09:29)
and then start fixing this holy guys but i just drove it around the neighborhood for the first time ever i owe baitec so much okay get my ears back here i literally just this is so dark here i am here i am i literally just drove down the road i went like five six hours down that way and i went four houses up that way turn around drove back down the driveway i was able to drive with no jerkiness um it's it's really rich because i messed around the last time i worked for the car and i bumped up my cells uh two and a half thousand or two thousand two hundred plus minus um to about four thousand i bumped them up quite high so it's pig rich it's like sitting in the tens uh when i actually hit those uh cells and i need to just sort that out

(Start: 00:10:30)
iron it out but i can now deliver fuel properly to my fuel pressure regulator how can i weigh it whatever and uh i just drove it for the first time in two and a half years i'm going to end the video here guys thank you so much for watching i'll see you on the next one [Music] peace [Music] um

Title: JDM CARS FOR SALE IN SOUTH AFRICA | Cheap Supra, Chaser's, Levin, Subaru's, GTO and MORE!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2XnyoNVCA0

(Start: 00:00:00)
could be licensed and if it is i'm not going to bother reading it [Music] another cheap project called this this episode is full of project cars one is code four and one is code two what's going on guys and welcome back to another jdm cars for sale in south africa video if this is the first time you're watching this i rate jdm cars out of for sale on platforms like gumtree olx facebook marketplace etc etc i'll give it a personal rating if you're the owner please take no offense it's just satire at the end of the day we're looking for jdm cars for sale so that you don't have to and remember if you haven't hit that sub button please do it helps the channel so much hit that notification bell as well so you can keep up to date with these type of videos i also have a bunch of jdm cars myself that i do diy and let's jump right into the video the first color we've got is a toyota supra it's like a yellow orange type color different cool it's got the same stereo that i've got an r32 gtr in not so good condition but it is the

(Start: 00:01:01)
moment race will looks like the original one too seats and everything else is questionable i don't know a bit tacky if you ask me especially that wow pedals anyway it's a super it's got some strange body kit on it um fitment is a hell of a level off it's probably just not buttoned on i don't know um anyway man's not a super which is cool this just looks incomplete to me anyway he wants 340k it's got some discs on here but i don't see license plates and i don't know what dusks those are hey it could be licensed those are outsurance uh stickers could be licensed and if it is that's a pretty cheap price for a supra it's likely not a twin turbo but it is manual anyway supra

(Start: 00:02:02)
not such a bad price 6.5 out of 10 because i don't like the body kit and i don't know if it's registered or not i don't think so moving on to a project car this is a mitsubishi gto it has a twin turbo v6 that is not in the vehicle it's in his bedroom with his sound system and his uh cars curtain anyway um it's in pieces and there's a model cars in the background that i never noticed and uh cool that's probably not his bedroom it's just the shop thing office cheap ish i don't know if it is registered i know you can't register these on the road unless you're returning resident or you buy a race car we still can't register it anyway uh it's here good price if if it is uh legal in essay so i'm going to give this i mean the ad doesn't say a lot the cars and pieces

(Start: 00:03:03)
give us a flat five out of ten 300 zx 2 model it's a twin turbo version priced at 170k i mean something like this could probably go down to about 150 that's usually the going rate for a very clean oh my god call it 110 for this one this is an order sorry edwin does look neat though 191 000 kilometers was it ninety one sorry i thought there was a one there look it's neat it's very new car but it's an order it's t-top i don't know six out of ten for me moving right on to this lexus now we featured a lexus like this a gs300 in the last video that particular one had a broken gearbox it was an auto box which was fine because you probably ripped it out anyway and throwing them and well this is a different car this one has

(Start: 00:04:04)
an engine issue so it says needs complete head car in good condition latest papers in order no outstanding license good price considering that it's got a tj the sub assembly might be fun don't know but something like this is uh a car that you could turn into like one of those executive it's at the right word there's another there's another word for it i've gone blank now they're doing the states looks like cool project car 5 out of 10 moving on to a blob eye wrx sti i don't generally show these later models on my videos i mean i don't really and i've got a soft spot because i had them but i prefer the gc8 models because it's like old and i like old things 224 000 kilometers wonder if you still got the stock cars sold doesn't say

(Start: 00:05:06)
doesn't say i'm wondering if it's been rebuilt and if it's still got the ej20 in it what's been done looks really really clean so 140 is a decent price for that let me give you a 7 out of 10. then i found this thing guy says make an offer he's in bloomfontaine otherwise automated offer feels yeah this is a tiered 11 and i think body to buy short of the engine gearbox seats and mags i think that's what it says that it's missing that anyway it's tier 11 it doesn't have paperwork but it's it's a cool looking car it's it's something different not something to see every every day and this could be turned some sort of a track car and looking at the condition uh you would probably not take a lot of money so maybe something to consider if you

(Start: 00:06:08)
guys are in the market for a project car uh i certainly am throw that rb20 in um but it's like i said it's in bloomfontaine and it's a bit of a hack to bring up down to durban especially with no wheels and no moving parts uh as a project car i'm gonna give it a flat five out of ten and then i actually sent this guy a message but he didn't reply this guy's got a toyota mr2 for sale he wants 12 000 ram you just got the shell there's no engine the interior and wheels and body are clean good car for drag there's no papers but as you know i've got the same mr2 sw20 black one that could be used as a space car and you know i don't know something else this is not the picture of the actual vehicle but uh he didn't reply to my message that i sent by gumtree direct so when you guys want to pick it up i'm kind of over it now it says your applause in 20 minutes didn't reply to me because it didn't reply i'm going to give this ad three out of ten ooh then we got a 84 that's in 280zx

(Start: 00:07:10)
it's an auto unfortunately trading is welcome but it is super super neat i think a lot of these cars a lot of ones that we have here in south africa they're mostly automatic this is sitting at a dealer motorific it is really neat just look at okay that's cover on the steering wheel but everything else is neat i don't generally go for these older let's say sub 89 model vehicles but i would really love to get my hands on a 280zx especially a z a z would be cool any any z because it's clean you can have a six out of ten ooh forgot about this one 2002 subaru wrx so it's a bug out model this one needs a lot of work license is behind 2012. that's gonna be costly to get that sorted out uh the engine is not in the car but i got car needs intercooler and brakes missing headlights missing fog covers

(Start: 00:08:10)
i don't know what else i mean that doesn't say a lot does it slow the gearbox yeah i don't know it's got cheap gauges in it what on earth is that again it could be it could be oh there's lots mismatched that's cool pretty termitama credit boost controller so i'm gonna say buy the car just for the parts but i don't worth that much anyway uh 30 grand cool nice project we're just gonna go again with the five out of ten rx eight at a bargain this one's sitting in durban 75 000 round nothing's done it's stock it looks looks cool i don't i'd love one of these it's not negotiable though quite recently rebuilt cost 50 round to rebuild then i'm much cleaner so considering that it's just had a

(Start: 00:09:11)
rebuild fifty thousand and rebuild i think it's a really good deal for 75k and it's sitting on my doorstep we're gonna give this a 7 out of 10 and then it's not often i put honda civics on the channel but uh this seems like a pretty decent project car if you ask me not that i know anything about honda civics but uh it's got a spare wheel it's black it's got some cheap-ish exhaust so it's got three rooms it's got rust on the front you can tell i know nothing about honda's other than the nsx 148 000 kilometers on it and uh that looks pretty screwed if you ask me i'm sure this was cool back in the day there probably lots now too but um oh okay hello it's missing something hey there's another wheel i think he just needs a new tire i'm not going to bother reading it ah

(Start: 00:10:11)
wow the is that beanie got an engine i don't know what engine that is cool it's a honda it's a civic uh it's a 5 out of 10. another subaru oh i forgot about this i actually wanted to look at those myself maybe i won't put this in the video uh forge bigger turbo management begins cooler roll cage 17 let's see two nevermind this is going in the video um yeah damn so it says this car was imported but then it's a bit strange because this wing didn't go on the wrxs or did it [Music] maybe the wing got swapped anyway

(Start: 00:11:12)
definitely not the the bumpers that are stock wrx would have on side skirts and everything else cool 85 grand is a little bit of a of an ask but uh yeah i'm sorry like a broken record it's about 5 out of 10. rx8 we actually featured nico in the previous video he had that crazy 300x with the 2j header built 2j and he does everything himself one of his rx8s he's selling two rxls here for 65 000 red one of them has a 1j in it or head i think he's taking it out yeah damn anyway selling it rolling chassis complete with no engine with second rx-8 all papers up-to-date licensed on the road that's pretty cool good deal if you ask me someone snapped this up pretty good project cause six out of ten because they're cool ah another cheap project called this this episode is full of project cars

(Start: 00:12:13)
before eleven thousand round or make an offer no engine no gearbox i don't think running chassis doesn't have a motor gearbox it's a project car so there's no papers it's sitting in pe of all places i don't know 11k that's that's cheap you can do something with a pretty converted rear wheel drive it's a big heavy car though um 5 out of 10. oh and then we've got this mr2 sw20 just kidding it's a ford probe i did however find you guys a chaser if my voice is sounding a little bit weird i've been sick these last few days that's coming coming around um chaser it's got a roll k roll called she says diff lock very strong drift or spin car new rust look custom paint yeah

(Start: 00:13:14)
it does look pretty rusty but that's cool it's different there's that big one you said lexus v8 engine cool cool cool car pretty econ licensed in the roads missing windows it's andre you want 35k another project car moving on to two honda s2000s for 200 000 round one is code four and one is code two code four is screwed like very screwed i'm assuming this is the code four and it is a manual front smash pretty minor accident damage okay this is the code for this one's co2 i don't know i don't know anything about this cause that is a lot of money for what's here this car runs five out of ten i should probably stop giving ratings tonight

(Start: 00:14:16)
oh gc8 one picture it's a corp 80 000 okay got another info these are terrible uh shitty ad three out of ten let's change it up boom another super it's not so not full of subarus uh this one is gp cars about to say it's a durban car i don't know what made me think that it's got str badges and stickers i mean those are not the stock str badges and stickers especially that one uh but it could be i don't know i can't see all the seats blue it does have brembos there's a telltale sign really weird color scheme might be an st i don't know about the seats six out of ten oh man's got a 200 sx uh with a buster number plate uh to swap for something else or for

(Start: 00:15:17)

i've got a package from japan that's butter my sanitizer let me go set up make some space on the table boom fragile japan okay i still don't know what this is it just says car accessory car accessory car accessory sticker i gotta say this company that i use from japan for the proxy servers their packaging is so sick so these are all little auctions that are one separately they've done a big consignment for me so they bubble wrap each and every one of them and it's not like a little bit of bubble wrap or something in damage this is hardcore wrapping and every single label reflects back to that particular auction yeah that's the one first one to open this is the apexi gauge for my r32 gtr this is awesome this cost

(Start: 00:01:00)
me like five grand it's a wrx blob eye five or six round i paid for this this is an r33 there's so many people asking me on my tick tock hey let me can you tell me how to import a miata like why we get them here miyaza is only the name that they use in the states in north america we've got an hk sticker a tom's sticker and then i've got a key on either this for the mrt because i don't have a spare this is a blitz big blitz gauge i don't know why i always take there uh okay so there's the gauge original blitz gauge actually in pretty decent condition this has been sprayed obviously to match his interior that i just need to remove but very very good condition look at that very mana scuff marks awesome awesome condition this gauge pad

(Start: 00:02:02)
i'll never use oh epic how cool is this this is an old-school boost controller and i can also do fuel rpm it's got all the wiring for it as well i likely never use it so there's your boost input that's your boost controller it's just high and low on and off and then this was some like piggyback type ecu back in the day really really good nick nice this particular wiring would be for the piggyback and then that would jump into the ecu i'll likely never ever use it but it's cool getting iconic parts like this this controller could be handy maybe i don't know and then three more things oh no this one this is a solenoid this is a boost controller

(Start: 00:03:02)
sick nice white face gritty mechanical oh good we're still recording uh this is not cracked but just put tape over the double-sided tape i guess to stop the packaging from getting sticky this is in great condition that boost controller this is like a week and a half later i've just been busy i'm not going to make any excuses my little  pile of all japanese stuff is getting larger and larger anyway i haven't gotten around to doing the the whole fuel pump swap or the fuel filter swap on the rx-7 to sort out that issue but i did do something it took me five minutes yes i pulled the fuel cover off on the silver f3 and i do the same on the black one

(Start: 00:04:04)
like that gosh i'll just try pushing the car out of the garage don't call me but so guess what i'm going to start the card up oh wait hang on i know why it's doing that it's because uh i've switched the ignition on yesterday after i unplugged that fuel pump assembly it'll probably come right when i start the car please work

(Start: 00:05:18)
it's normalizing so jesus i was a little bit heavy on the foot there for a tick-tock video uh check this out [Music] holy crap coincide with this fuel pump fuel pressure whatever the hell issue it is uh it seems to be fine when it's on like cold start though i don't know it's uh if i revert it's targeting to like 5k whatever i'm about to bug bomb this

(Start: 00:06:18)
place okay let's go do the fog gets on anyway i don't want this video to be super long in the next day or two i am going to tackle the fuel pumps i am going to start there and then i'm going to do the fuel filter go from there i'm going to fog this place up and i'll see you guys in a few days for another video peace

(Start: 00:01:02)
niko sprayed this car himself it's like a glistening purple slash black color really really good looking so i'm going to give this a biased rating very biased rating one actually i do like the car and i do like the engine in the car and i like that it's put together really well and the ad is fantastic i'm gonna give this a good old nine out of ten moving right on onto this mx-5 i get a lot of these questions on my tik-tok especially on my tik-tok please tell me how to import a miata why do you want to import a miata when we have them locally miata is left-hand drive united states they're exactly the same cars we've got them here and we've always had them here they're called mx-5s here's an example it's a 2001 it's not one with the pop-up headlights it is however going quite cheap 60k there's a few issues faulty o2 sensor let's go check engine light from that and then yeah it's it's got the hard top and soft

(Start: 00:02:03)
top which is cool 60k 60k is a good price i mean the ad is decent it's a project car at the end of the day good price for a project car i gotta give this a six out of ten moving on to 200 sx i've actually recently seen this on instagram it's got a it's the same car for sure rb25 fat boy gearbox spatronics with bluetooth setup uh recently done spark plugs daily tune it must really pull it with a rb in it pretty there's no pictures of the actual engine bay that's cool i've always wanted as13 1990 so it's second model the second year 105k guess you got to pay a little bit more if you're getting an rb25 i'm gonna go with the six out of ten for this too and then we have an altezza this however cannot be registered it does have a beams engine on it i don't think this uh i forgot the name

(Start: 00:03:04)
of this it's not smoked out it's uh i used to have it on my own subaru i did more frogs on this lemon lemon or something illuminate i don't remember anywhere else here's that's basically an is-200 with a different engine in it and it's got an exhaust 63 ml exhaust at two and a half inch and stock otherwise there's your beams i would have loved to throw one of these in my mr2 maybe i'll still in the future i need money first i've got no money so seeming as blank down chat this is not sa reg i can you can really see here there's a b this is a botswana car for sure botswana car conrad i don't know cool car nonetheless 5 out of 10 stadium and then we've got this one this has appeared on the channel when it was a private sale i believe the owner i forgot the name here

(Start: 00:04:05)
he had a company here in durban that modified cars since the aids performance not ace anyway he's i believe he's got an evo as well and a few other cars anyway his car is now sitting at a dealer said it's spectacular r33 we've gone through this car before we have seen it it's got um apexi something in the car do you remember something apexie in here now remember i don't look through all of these ads i'll just open them up and then what i'm seeing right now is pretty much what you guys are seeing avcr apex avcr i remember this it was like completely stock other than the squiddy turbo timer and the avcr gear knob it's nice but it's also pricey but it's the going rate i can't argue that i'm not going to give us a rating because i have given it a rating in the past some cars pop up that i've already looked at if they are cheaper and i just thought i'd show this one now because it's sitting at a dealer and they're asking roughly the same price what you wanted before

(Start: 00:05:05)
if you wanted 570 or 580. then we have a rather pricey 200 sx is that an s14 in the background no combi uh rather pricey 200 x sx with a ca 18 adt um yeah let's go t3t4 turbo 750 injectors daily runner however needs any spark plugs and these are dyno blah blah blah blah it's got a sub i don't know very basic spec it's got a it's got a nice front bumper front mount insecure some pop works done the engine bay looks neat it actually looks really decent but that asking process is a little bit much that's some dodgy hong kong steering wheel channel thing

(Start: 00:06:06)
here that's what it does probably looks like water gauge gauges if i had to get this guy account never would because of the price the price is ridiculous i would throw in one of the spare steering wheels that i've got like a true momo and then i've got blitz gauges grady gauges a pixie gauges go to town there we go there's auto gauge or something nasty that's a blanking for one of the gauges i mean no disrespect it's just it's a bit pricey it is clean though that is not a s14 my bad looks like a 323 anyway i wish you well at the sale but that should probably come down i'm going to give this a 5 out of 10. 300 zx okay so there's only three photos and a one liner

(Start: 00:07:06)
that's amazing okay so this is the real deals twin turbo version apparently there's no engine bay fix and i see something else there's automatic hope not it's in durban this is in the palm town area owned by an older gentleman who for the past eight years almost said he passed away eight years ago uh i don't know man i've got to give this out a 5 out of 10. i'm not going to get much detail into it because there is not a lot of detail that i can talk about other than that big-ass wing in three little pictures another mx-5 this one japanese reliability [Music] questionable 95 grand it's got pop-ups which is good they need to be realigned but it's got pop-ups that can be fixed soft top was it a hot top is that a hot tub soft top and hard top nice i believe it's it's difficult to get the

(Start: 00:08:07)
hot tops not ready this is cool stock wheel from what i can see nice nice though oh wow stock engine bay besides the sensor that was put on here and that's running somewhere probably coming around the back uh here it goes i wonder what that's about it must be a water temp sensor has to be nice car probably a little bit high on the price but you've got hard top and you've got a soft drop which is nice seven out of ten i never thought i'd give a mx five a seven out of ten but cool honda prelude i actually know nothing about honda's other than the nsx it's got a 2.2 liter vt ir it's got a vtec 70k looks clean i like the stock steering wheel stock gear knob so it's a

(Start: 00:09:08)
manual it's got the stock tape play on the car missing carpets that's fine no i thought there was a carpet and i think the steering wheel's a bit buggered but it's stock and it's got a i know it's stock interior my bad it's got 17 inch wheels got a straight puff exhaust and a dictator that must sound okay like honda ish gotta go the six out of ten it's neat it's neat i'm giving it a 6 out 10 because it's neat oh then this car popped up recently rx-7 it's got a roll cage in it it's got what i can see as deffi gauges it's got a momo wheel not the prettiest of momo wheels but it does have one i wonder if the stuff came like this from japan i wonder front mount insecure pretty much the same setup that i've got with the front mount

(Start: 00:10:10)
obviously he's could've done better pop work i've i've got long pieces of silicon because i never took mine to a proper builder i did everything in-house but he does a big filter there he's done away with the pop-ups [Music] nice garage very nice garage dance goals right there crazy skirts crazy bumper at least the bumper matches because he's done the the headlights in there rear wing big rear wing it's not the type rsd and all that spirit r-wing there's a full list i think this may have popped up on the channel about a year or two ago ago i do mention did mention this and i have seen this before rather i'm gonna i'm gonna give this car a seven out of ten because he's throwing a nice big spec list and he imported from japan and the engine was rebuilt as well from aj

(Start: 00:11:11)
racing very very nice moving on to this uh expensive example of a 260z somebody ping me recently asking if i've seen any 240s well this is about as close as we're going to get on all the marketplace places i don't know this 260z is expensive you can now import them they're 40 years old anything older than 40 you need to speak to server south african vintage and veteran association and get a permit from them then you'll take that permit or approval rather to itec itec will then give you the permit then you follow the exact process that you would on a collector's item vehicle to bring it into africa and you can get these very cheap in the states and overseas you're going to have to find a right-hand drive version though left and drive you won't be able to bring it well he's not easily good looking car though for the true enthusiasts was a 25 year

(Start: 00:12:13)
old barn find restored from the ground up i mean don't get me wrong it's it's great but i don't know so much about that to say i am going to give it a decent rating of 7 out of 10 because i have a soft spot for these oh moving on to this evo 7 about swan and registered it's got a decent ad here so these look like maintenance items really cars registered in botswana it's unfortunate you won't be able to register in south africa easily unless you're returning resident you're coming back from botswana and this car was there then you could possibly buy it bring it across no problem anyway it looks to be in stock form that's a stock engine based stock intake very nice 4g 63t don't think that is stock i'm not 100 sure but that that's a good looking interior these

(Start: 00:13:14)
carpets or rubber mats they don't belong that doesn't belong the gauge doesn't belong other than that car stock looks really good seats are stock stock requires stock boot trunk damn i mean there's a pity we can't get these easily in south africa or so reg there are a couple but they're brought through returning residents or de la mata brought one or two in so unfortunately because it's botswana registered just slap on a six out of ten oh my god this car so i saw this about two three weeks ago plus minus and i had a laugh at it and i was supposed to film one of these episodes and i just couldn't find a lot of cars for sale so i'll kind of put this on hold luckily it's still for sale so i could show you guys and laugh a little bit about the ad unless he has fixed it so he's he's done the whole color matching like to a veil side

(Start: 00:14:15)
so it's it's close but look at that let's look at the pictures first that's missing one headlight cover over here what do you notice no rotary it's got a 2j in it that's cool it's got some sort of body kit on it you can't see that much but it ain't no veil side kit and if you scroll down look at the ad here's the funny part 2jc powered has non-vvt eti in so that's cool it's got a bc rev kit blah blah it has a forger braking system all around i've never heard about that one pedal box here's the funny part it's got a dictator management xbox it's got wall bro that's the extra l the car makes 560 kilohertz okay that is mean that would probably mean uh 1.5 bar boost but spinning missing an o

(Start: 00:15:17)
too much on the dunno more videos yeah we'll be sending if you are offers welcome um yeah it also mentioned here that it has a veil sidekick where is that metaphor and veil sidekick that is the furthest thing from maybe it is a veil sidekick but not the same one from the fast and furious movie the color yes that about it i'm just because he's made some crazy power and i mean the ad is okay other than the spelling issues and not making too much sense yeah six out of ten another rx-7 popped up this one has a rotary in it which is cool it does have a big single turbo he's got a front mount installer from not radio he's got a sparco seat in it there's one of the stock later model seats so

(Start: 00:16:18)
what what your model is this one it's a cool we often don't see those seats in in some of the models those look like brembos on the car possibly brembos or just re-spray gold calipers let's see if we can get a clearer image it could be brambles it could be nice setup fuel pressure regulator at the top ft3s for sale uh list of modification extremes were endless oh i mean they seem to end over there but george is selling it i think he might be portuguese and oh there we go oh no okay that's a different name luige but then george is anyway portuguese brand new master power i'm not gonna read this you guys pause the video we'll go take a look at the ad go buy the car i'm gonna give this it's got a sparkle harness i saw that now nice it's got these things dampeners uh seven out of ten

(Start: 00:17:21)
good luck with the sail man moving on to this gs 300 now you gotta remember something these have got a 2j in it it's an n a version of the 2j so it's a ge but it does have a 2j in it this one however has a problem with the gearbox which is fine because it has a 2j in it if the engine is working this could be a really decent project car pull it out redo this whole thing and get a manual in here i mean you can make it look semi-stock do some work on the 2j maybe do an nat conversion and obviously clean up the rest of the vehicle you can do like a vrp top spec with built 2j and this could be an absolute beast for an asking price of 25 000 you could probably knock them down a little bit more i don't know this is ridge if if if i had the finances right now i would throw 20k cool car

(Start: 00:18:23)
busy sitting in neutral or reverse because the price is really good and it's got a 2j and there seems to be nothing wrong with the engine only other than the gearbox i'm going to give this a nice 7 out of 10 because it seems like a good project car oh and this seems like a really bad project car this is a mark iii super gt twin turbo rolling edition okay it's just twin turbo edition but uh this car is rusty looks like surface rust wait till you see the interior damn oh what's in the background i just noticed this now i don't know what that is push a little push anyway um cheap i guess i don't know if it's got papers i doubt it four out of 10. the ad don't tell you nothing negotiable

(Start: 00:19:25)
um then we have okay this is technically not really jdm this is mitsubishi steering remember some time ago i went to actually take a look at one it was the proper esir model the all-wheel drive a really cool car and then i decided not to pull the trigger and i actually yeah i don't know kind of regret it now this is the usdm version so it's left hand drive apparently this one's legendary this particular model is not legendary it's also missing some pieces um yeah real head turner people refer to as fondly as the kit knight riders got and i've never heard that one but i did go and see that esi our model which has the wide body and the 4g63t a lot better than the 2.6 liter us spec i don't even want to rate this because i may offend the owner so another lexus this one

(Start: 00:20:25)
is in very good neck very very good nick look at that engine bay wow is 300 i probably should have paused on there so there's your 2j it'll be the same as the other one goodbye but not goodbye hello this is a great buy 80 grand neat looks like it's well looked after again now let's just go with the seven out of ten that's the is model so it's a little bit sportier as well not as bulky as the other one the last two vehicles is this mach3 silica guy wants a thousand two hundred [Music] it's probably a typer uh vehicle is in good condition has no motor gearbox it is a import it is an import was a race car okay i don't know maybe it does 1200

(Start: 00:21:29)
bucks or maybe it's with its front wheel drive though it could always be converted give this a 5 out of 10 i'm just not sure on the price and the last vehicle for the evening is this listen champ bucky 1400 nothing to fix i don't know i don't know much about these but i mean you could turn this into oh look at that jdm thing it's got a little samurai saw there for again up it it looks like it needs a hell of a cleanup this is an old school setup look at that size of this thing oh my gosh no comment no rating that is it for the video thank you so much for watching really appreciate it i will be diving into the garage pretty soon i need to do some stuff on both the rx 7s and i'll be uploading that in the near future thank you so much for watching we'll see you in the next one peace

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome to a brand new video it has been very long time since i've done a beautiful daytime shoot okay it's kind of windy and uh it's been raining the last few days but i'm here during the day and we're going to take a look at some of my cars and i brought up the r32 gtr i've been starting it every two weeks plus minus give or take let's say every 10 days however i haven't started the black rx-7 in a little while the mr2 gets started as well every 10 days drive the cars up and down the driveway and uh the silver rx-7 i've got a pretty decent update to tell you guys on that car with some video footage uh not the best of news but we'll dive right into that in a sec before we dive into the video i want you guys to head over to my mate in cape town wong street track go take a look at his youtube channel his instagram his tick tock he's got some pretty awesome stuff he's got a wild civic that has been inspired by many different iconic hondas go take a look super cool stuff he posts every week and

(Start: 00:01:00)
daily on instagram a lot more effort than i put in but uh go take a look go show him some love so the 32 is out i decided to actually pull it out of the cardboard it's been undercover or under covers for a little while it's a little bit dusty i've got a little bit of dust that flies underneath there but let me get this sorted out close the area up but i've got no workers because we're on lockdown i can't do everything myself i'm already battling i don't have a gardener so i'm able to cut grass on my own ah you can see i'm doing a piss-poor job right over there but i'm doing what i can with the kids and whatnot i'm supposed to build this carport over here and that hasn't that hasn't happened actually i left the marking there i'm supposed to break that open and then there's another one down there break that open and one somewhere where i'm standing and then build a cardboard here and get it approved and yeah anyway i'm to be swapping the black mr2 with the black rx-7 i put the black rx-7 here because i have an issue i have an issue

(Start: 00:02:02)
with this car let's just climb right into that before we talk about 32. i was going to say old faithful rx-7 but it's not exactly old well it is old but it's not faithful uh you all know i went across to this whole september and everything's pretty much buttoned up i'm happy with the setup i'm done and dusted except for my strut brush i mean this is minus stuff strap brace needs to be sent off center it needs to be primed it needs to be painted black again and then my color scheme was purple purple and gold that's changed now because the turbo is red so that pop over there i have a new black pop somewhere there that needs to be swapped out and then these need to be changed to red which i picked up some red that kind of matches i mean it's kind of kind of slightly brighter i'm not going to find dull oh you guys are nice or something haven't you look what i got got my lights excuse the mess feel like a broken record lacking time these days got my lights

(Start: 00:03:04)
for my bumper finally those are from japan sent those on the 26th of october they gotcha like last week anyway we're going to start the bumperwork but first i want to iron out some some teething issues one being the downpop side i've got some good advice from a whole bunch of you guys tony gave some great advice a bunch of you guys have some really awesome advice jason etc and i'm gonna be trying all the stuff just to figure out where the leak is and how to sort it out the main issue i'm having with this car and if you want to click off the video this is purely updates just by the buy the main issue i'm having with this car is i'm leaning out anything over to in a bit cave like when i go on load there's a quick video i took off my phone i sent this to my buddy gavin overseas baytech and he seems to think that it's either fuel pump or fuel filter now either suspicion could be both um but probably one of those or causing the issue what is happening is you can see in this

(Start: 00:04:05)
video i'm trying to get up my driveway and i can't the car is just bogging and jumping and going crazy so i got a bit of a steep driveway going on here and what happens if i adjust the the fueling over here like like you've seen it it does uh it does actually do the trick so i can lean it out i can i can add more make it red should be here no problem i've been throwing some high numbers up at the top but it's still leaning out so look at this i'm going to try to grab my driver the car just keep bucking out it's like it's leaning out but i'm just i'm throwing fuel and it's doing absolutely nothing i have no idea what to do now i'm able to adjust and the fuel pressure regulator is working because i'm able to adjust fuel when the cars idle so for example i can throw fuel at the car and change my lean and

rich condition on idle i can make it run really rich would it used to be it was running like ten point something which i addressed in another video ten point something and idling out oddly in ten point something and then i've i've leaned it out a bit to like twelve eight thirteen somewhere around there and idle is a lot better and i must say the whole idle everything's running very nicely the problem is trying to drive the car and it's leaning out it's hitting 17 18 lean conditions when i put on a little bit of load and try go up the driver so it can't be fuel pressure regulator um and it's leaning out and i can't adjust it i've thrown tons and tons and tons i mean i've held plus down on the keyboard with my fc data logger and just added a ton of fuel to those cells that i'm targeting so i've got a map watch running i'm targeting specific cells when i'm trying to go up the driver or even just trying to go backwards and forwards here and uh i've thrown a lot of fuel in it it should be pig rich like i'm talking like eight or

(Start: 00:06:05)
nines but it's still showing lean conditions at 17. my injectors are firing they are working because i swapped those out of the black fd a little while ago and they working on both cars and i swapped them back so the black fda was actually running et cetera et cetera so what i'm going to do in one putting a black fd there is because i've called around and nobody has stock of the fuel filter and i've looked online and i don't know what the hell car matches up with rx-753s looks like maybe the mx-5 one but i'm not certain i phoned the likes of autozone modders and they like rx7 85 to 89 i'm like no no 92-2002 help me and uh they're like a little bit lost today miami the spears uh so subsequently i have ordered one from japan doesn't come with another box that i've ordered with a whole bunch of gauges and goodies and whatnot um so i'm not too worried about that but i wanted to sort this thing i want that wasn't english i want to sort this thing out

(Start: 00:07:07)
soon and the quickest and easiest because i've got two rx7s is just rip it out the black one throw it into this one through this one's the black car does the black one do the same yes cool it's the fuel filter this one sorted cool drive it around with the second hand i'm gonna call second hand fuel fill so the new ones arrived and put the one back in the back car then there's fuel pump swap it with a black car but i'll do one at a time let's see actually what my issue is that is the update on the silver fd i was attempting in the little clip to drive the car on the road for the very first time and then those issues happen and well i kind of got a little bit despondent pick up the camera for a week or so honest truth nothing touch cars the gtr the gtr my friends is still in pieces it's still needing to be put together over here huge mess

(Start: 00:08:08)
shit's dangling it's falling around whoops see i made it even worse now that's supposed to go in there okay the reason why i've left it like this is because i ordered that really awesome apexi boost gauge that's going to be here i've actually got it ready on the way and i've got a tamayo one in the way i'm going to decide which i'm going to put into my is not going to fit up to 60 ml so either the gritty or the apex you'd be more than likely the apexi the grady is a white face and then i've got a blitz one on the way but i'll throw the apexie um since i'm not driving the cars around because of lockdown and all that stuff i figured just leave it like this instead of ripping and repairing i do need to clean up this wiring specifically that the rest is okay fix that piece and then and then i'm good that that's pretty much it on the gtr other than cleaning up this mr2 i'm thinking about getting a detail to come in and just sort out the swirl marks sort out the the paint issues it also needs a good rub down again and

(Start: 00:09:08)
polish so i'm thinking about calling in the detail doctor sometime soon getting installed this car because it has been resprayed and it's looking decent just a little update video i thought i'd let you guys know where i'm standing with the cars and what's going on what i'm doing with them and that i am making some effort now going forwards to get these cars sorted out all that being said i have another jdm cars for sale in south africa video coming out pretty soon lots of stuff that's come out keep an eye out for that hit that notification bell so you can keep up to date with all the videos and thank you so much for watching we'll see you in the next one peace

(Start: 00:01:01)
right into it jumping right in with something that i'm gonna say is rare here in south africa because i've only ever seen two others for sale a gold one that wasn't so reg and then i saw or sorry i think the golden was essential and there was a white one that wasn't or the other way around and a lot better condition than this one so toyota sarah i mean everybody probably knows about them now because of mighty car mods these are the cars that uh the doors lift up so you can see here the door thingymabob the door actually goes up like this what do you call it going is it going on this car maybe tierracer it's a very much underpowered vehicle it's got a 1.5 liter toyota engine of some sorts this one in particular looks a little worse where it's likely sa rage i can't tell i mean it does have another plate but i can't see if it's got a license to scan there's not a lot of stuff here but it needs a lot of ltc attention a little bit of tlc maybe anyway that's

(Start: 00:02:03)
the toyota sarah because the rarity rarity and because there's not a lot of info and the pictures of crap i'm just going to give this a flat 5 out of 10 that's my personal rating moving on to this gorgeous looking 286 to the camera 200 sx s13 with an rb25 engine in it or gt3076 this must be a beast you have 234 kilowatts it's a lot car it's a small car so it must kick ass body requires some ltc tlc 90 000 round good money proper proper straight pop this fender looks a little bit off here battery has been relocated to the beauty could probably use a bit of a tidy up with with all these cables and there's a relay back here things are looking yeah looking like that could be neatened up and traced and

(Start: 00:03:04)
probably some stuff ripped out but yeah bodywork looks okay see that's cool i'm just about to say what management because it's missing the cast sensor here cool i like it i mean it's very very simple what's what's been thrown in here um but it's it does the job and i'm sure this thing kicks some serious butt got a neochrome gear knob in it could be a razor knob i don't know nice and i think decent asking price as well if it's slightly negotiable decent asking price i'm gonna give this card looks good it's almost stock interior almost i'm gonna give this car seven out of ten then this mr2 has come off herself never seen this car before it's in johannesburg pretoria sorry it's a gt which means it is the

(Start: 00:04:05)
turbocharged variant it's got a 3s gte in it gara t3t4 turbo so the stock turbo i think it's 28 that's in these ct20b has now come out my mustache is h good looking car i want it so he goes out to me to get off the versus german meats and all that sort of stuff this is cool radio fans in the back i'm not radiator fans it's just cooling fans a lot of a lot of these uh have this this particular mod seems to be working out quite nicely is it nice intake i'm assuming that's an arp intake no it's not it's just powder coated or that other spray that you buy i forgot the name of the spray the red crinkle one vht or something anyway cool car bit of a i don't know if it's steep i don't think it's steep nah that's a good process hey mine's also 19 months on 911 good price

(Start: 00:05:07)
i guess 145k let's go so you can get up seven out of ten i like you coming up with another toyota i wasn't just hitting toyotas at once uh this car has been for sale before uh ivor in cape town he's selling us its full essay reg the price has come down it was seven something 620 now it's the reason why i'm bringing it up again is because one the price drop two because there's a lot more photos so i'm not going to give us a rating because we did get it rating before i've got the same gold tape in my rx-7 i mean this tube is it's a precision precision 7675 it's it's big look it is a big turbo i just came out of the garage prior to filming this looking at the rx-7 and now looking at this it's like the the r the turbo got an rx7 that whole set is just ridiculously big cool car somebody buy it it's their edge even says he's got the sad 500 tax clearance that's your size uh payment thing then we've got an 83 rx 7

(Start: 00:06:10)
this is an fb looks like there's been a price drop already um yeah 135 995 he likes his 995 isn't he he's dropped it by 11k all paperwork is an order two-door magrums making 280 kilowatts at 0.5 bar on a 66 mil table quite a small compressor housing big exhaust housing i can't wait here feel whatever on my car if you haven't watched the video watch the video prior to this car is done i'm ready like one more thing i need to do is just connect the wire band up to the fc hacker so i can interface and yeah all that sort of stuff uh but yeah i'm ready i'm ready to drive it on the road and give it some boost missing a rear windscreen it's actually not such a big turbo this kind of looks like the turbo that i've got on that i had on the car that i pulled off you know it needs a lot of work before i

(Start: 00:07:12)
can see bodywork looks good uh tsw wheels like i don't know i think i'd ask you prices a bit much there's a couple others for sale that are a lot cheaper probably not with extensive engine work that this one has it doesn't actually say is it a oh it does sorry it's a bridgeport my apologies i gotta give this a five and a half out of ten then there's a supra with a 1j 2.5 dbti license is up to date 150k he's got goaling doors those are called goaling looks like a pretty stock 1j it's just it covers have been painted red i think everything else is stuck he's even got the viscous fan on it looks good nothing much to it western cape car gotta watch out for some rust same with the durbin cars anyway uh

(Start: 00:08:14)
i think it's a cool car it's a t-top as well i don't know about so much about the goal wings but other than that i like it six out of ten aha was i reading this i don't remember highlighting this uh miata or mx-5 this one's in durban hey look at that i know this this isn't much longer cool car hey it's got half a cage looks pretty stuck i mean it's right how to stock wheels on stock it's got led lights in the front what has he done aftermarket intake cheap led headlights nice i need some tlc no cracks in even interior that's cool in queensborough what's the price 65k i think that's pretty pretty affordable this is like a first car where you want to start getting into japanese cars this is it

(Start: 00:09:14)
let me give this a 6 out of 10. ah this thing i saw this i don't think this is sa registered uh selling a gto v6 double overhead cam uh done the tensioner then you start everything on an engine is good and i need to work on it mineral little tlc yeah that's like it i really i really wonder if this car actually has paperwork anyway that is what it is there's no price i know nothing about this uh worth of shot i guess i don't know i'm gonna rate this because the ad is up to crap three out of ten ha ha this has been on the channel three times already well this is the third time it is uh for

(Start: 00:10:16)
sale again but there is however a price drop and it's a fairly decent brass drop it's a 100k price drop since the last time it was on the channel and it is negotiable you all know this car it has a v8 conversion so purists are going to get angry i couldn't be bothered not rating you because you've been on here before this car is sitting at jdm collective in johannesburg it's got 33 000 kilometers on the clock and you know just to sum this up i'm going to steal a comment quite from jdm collectors themselves it's like stepping into a time machine just look at this it is stock obviously not the head unit and not the 320 k in our nismo dials didn't do the white face here either but everything other than that is stuck and it looks

(Start: 00:11:17)
bloody good stock wheels even how i would love that's not stuck and it's not stuck it's close enough how i would love something like this beautiful seven out of ten because it's not stuck enough coming from the man who  breaks everything and modifies everything ooh this hasn't been on the channel before it has got a massive shopping list pause the video and take a look i'm going to read through all this but it's got 600 kilowatts on e50 ethanol whole bunch of work 67 66 turbo uh dude 11 second don't bother me if you can't afford it people do not bother him yeah that's sick hey there's another one gp registered

site that i use is called from japan yeah from japan it's actually pretty cool dot co dot jp amazing starts it's a proxy service in a nutshell what they do is they will bid on your behalf so let's say you go and find an item boost controller for instance they will bid on your behalf if you win the boost controller they will then receive it at their warehouse and they will charge you a handling fee that will charge you a domestic shipping fee because let's say the the boost controller is sitting in chubu japan their warehouse is in tokyo obviously there's some sort of shipping domestic-wise so they'll charge you for that there's no markup on that and then they'll charge you that handling fee and then from there you can package and send the the package to wherever you live so from my case it'll be in south africa now they do consignment shipping which is amazing this is cool they give you 45 days warehousing so if you buy a pot you've got 45 days to send it down to south africa or wherever you live and you can bundle it and you can do a consignment and they calculate

(Start: 00:02:02)
how much each item weighs and the volumetric size and they'll tell you okay it's going to be an xyz box and inside that box you can pack five six seven items and from there you then ship it and they'll give you a price beforehand before you ship it which is super cool now from japan itself looks like this this this is your your front end i don't have any funds in here at the moment because i just spent everything but i'm going to show you some our previous um bids and uh stuff that i've won how cheap it was how much the shipping was to south africa and then talk about some tips and tricks all right so this is the front page on here there's a lot of stuff that may or may not interest you that is not automobile related or vehicle related this stuff doesn't interest me so what i do is i jump straight on here i don't click on your auctions i type in for example hks and once this loads up i will then start to narrow my searches

(Start: 00:03:02)
so i will go automobiles let it refresh and then there's a couple options just like ebay a couple options on here to do a few things so one i do not look at the shopping shop sites whatsoever these shopping sites are retailers click off the retailers it'll refresh and now it's only showing the auctions okay there are a few people that do auctions for brand new stuff but narrow it down again go use the items only yes this video is particularly on used items we're going to be looking at a lot of used stuff so you you'll see straight off the bat it comes up recommended what's recommended here's hkis you can see there's a t-51r turbo that madness someone's bidding on this already there's all sorts of stuff in here what i do is there's some specific times where the auctions are pumping now i'm going to talk to african time if you're international i'm really sorry but uh you can calculate we gmt plus two um i look at

(Start: 00:04:04)
2 p.m to 3 p.m south african time at that time that's evening for the japanese it's like seven or eight or maybe slightly off in that let's let's say between six and eight pm now that's the time everyone's just come off work they've gotten relaxed they're at home and now they've realized that they've got too much junk at home and they want to start peddling their stuff on yoho auctions and they generally set auctions for a couple days like five to seven days and at the time they set it or put it to sell that's the time it's going to end in five to seven days okay so what i do around that time i will go on at about midday my time and i will go shortest time remaining shortest and it'll show me you can see here that in two minutes this one's coming to an end okay in four hours this part works coming to an end okay you can narrow these searches down to something more specific so if you're looking for an hks exhaust i wouldn't recommend because shipping is a bit higher

(Start: 00:05:05)
but you put an hks exhaust now here's the first tip what i do is i use google translate because the website is japanese and it searches in japanese it doesn't search in english but words like hk is greedy those are brand names those will always come up so what i'll do here is i'll put in um boost okay so boost in japanese bosuto i think i'll copy this at the top here that copy and i'll go in and i can either go hks boost or i'll just throw in boost let's see what hks boost shows so there's some stuff here that's popped up so here's a boost gauge ace case boot hks boost gauge i'm so tongue-tied tonight there's a boost controller a legit boost control it's actually the same one that's currently my rx-7 fd 3s and the silver one which is going to be coming out and you can see the process this is a buy it now price meaning you don't have to bid it's 664 round or

(Start: 00:06:07)
4500 yen and it's a fully fledged it's missing buttons but it is a boost controller okay it probably works you probably don't need all those buttons and there's a solenoid and all that stuff but you can find other deals and other stuff that is a lot cheaper so that's one way of doing it is going on at like midnight's african time or maybe 4 00 p.m in japanese time and going to see what's coming up in two to three hours time and set a reminder on your cell phone or wherever you want a reminder of one hour and 54 minutes to go in bed and then you want to do some like stuff called snap bits and you'll go in late and you'll bid late a lot of the stuff that rarer stuff does go quite expensive i don't really buy the rare stuff i buy a lot of gauges and i'll show you what i have bought and then i generalize my searches as well now i'm giving you guys all my tips and tricks there which is probably something i shouldn't be doing but uh what the hell i'm here to help so for example i'm gonna

(Start: 00:07:10)
widen my search now and i'm just gonna search for boost across the board and i'm going to find all the boost gauges all the boost controllers all the stuff like that i can type in turbo tama and obviously use english to japanese translation type and turbo timer i think it's also called turbo turbo timer type type or timer watch table timer okay so here again just double check that your stuff is still set to used auction etc the first set of stuff is is crap but you got to look for the deals on here and you're going to scroll down you're going to look for stuff and i'm sure you'll find i haven't been on a few days but here's a fuel cup defender for an rx7 i'll just open up a couple tabs and we'll take a look in a sec and then here's the gauge okay so obviously our country japanese don't know what it says so i open it up for later and i can see the pricing on here is

(Start: 00:08:10)
it's pretty cheap there's no pixie gauge it's going in five days a thousand japanese 147 round okay i'm going to open up this solenoid as well and i'll come back to that okay so as you can see there's a lot of stuff on here and a lot of stuff for cheap there's some stuff that allows you to buy it now and other stuff that you got to put money down for an auction what happens is you place the deposit first with from japan place the deposit then you can bid on items and it takes the the money off your deposit or your credit and it uses it to bid on certain items if you don't win the item the money will come back into your account back into your deposit if you do win it'll be paid off and then all you've got to pay for thereafter is the shipping and handling and all that stuff okay so that's how you find items and like i said earlier i generally hit apexi grady hks to my tom's

(Start: 00:09:13)
tommy cairo you know all the big names out there just smash them and go and search every day that's that's pretty much what i do and i'll search around that time to know the stuff's coming up i'll look at low to high as well because then i'll know like this one and i'll keep an eye on it so for example this gauge here um actually let's just take anything um so there's a this not sports uh fuel cut and boost control device this is for an rx-7fd it's basically just to cut that that fuel cut so if you put it in a boost control you can up the booster and and it's not going to cut your fuel in your your spark if you want to come back in four days time let's say you don't want to put your deposit down you just click on this hot and then you've got a little watch list you can come back to it here's that gauge that i opened this one is interesting it's a pivot gauge which is quite nice it looks like a full digital one uh wiring is somewhat there from what i can see so you just need to really go through it there is a description here

(Start: 00:10:13)
you gotta translate select english and i'll tell you what it is and there's some funny stuff here uh we have not been able to test the ultimate this time uh the face panel is loosely glued there's really broken english in some of these and it is sometimes funny and here's another pivot one this one's ending in 19 hours and it's a mechanic one okay i might actually snatch this one up before editing this video so pivot's another mic that i look at and i buy um this apexi one mechanical as well i'm not gonna pick up another apexy one because i actually just won one recently and um this why i brought this up okay this is like a electric scramble boost control this is a solenoid for a boost controller and why i'm mentioning this is because i also pick up certain parts cheap for example i won and let's go take a look at my

(Start: 00:11:16)
my shipping history on my account i've won certain items that are missing components for example i've won a boost controller an hk's boost controller that is missing you can see all the stuff that i've picked up here's my apexi uh boost gauge that i picked up this is for the gtr and uh has a gritty boost gauge mechanical one in good condition i picked up for a thousand yen bought a banner bought some random stuff i got another blitz boost gauge mechanical as well some seriously cheap little models a boost controller and another boost controller and then a key on usb key for my mr2 and then i was talking about the

(Start: 00:12:22)
um um now the consignment shipping is something we'll look at in the sick but buying these boost controllers stuff like that i found this one for one yen and then a month later or it was a month before that i actually i picked up the solenoid so i've actually got the solenoid already and i want it for like 100 or 200 yen which is also nothing it's like 30 rand and i won the solenoid now i've got the best control put them together and i've got a working full set boost controller hopefully working some of the stuff hasn't arrived yet which is unfortunate but that is that of things to remember so search types we

(Start: 00:13:23)
spoke about search for used look at low to high and then look at shortest time as well and then base yourself around those times when the japanese start arriving home and start bidding there don't bid emotionally it's not worth it there's stuff that i'm like holy crap uh apexi this or whatever rare and i'll start hitting in the bed and it's not worth it because you might win stuff that's a little bit more expensive than it should be for example i did when i'm hoping it's still on the front here but i won that second yeah so i won this boost controller with a gritty gauge everything fully operational five thousand yen okay that's like seven hundred and something grand i won that together whereas now you'll find the the boost control on the solenoid for this particular model going for 10 000 yen plus

(Start: 00:14:26)
okay so don't emotional bid don't sit there and try and beat the other guy okay there will always be another unit maybe not in the rare stuff but you know on the stuff like this yes there will be another piece of advice a bit late try a bit as late as possible don't don't wait till like the 30-40 seconds i've been called out website hung on my side i don't know what the hell i was i ran a ping to google i was still paying to google i could browse on the other side but i couldn't get through from japan to today for like two minutes and then i lost my that's a three minute mark you'll be safe should be safe now with regards to shipping you can do consignment shipping i've only got one item that needs to be shipped click on shipping instruction and here is my item i've actually got something that's still on the way it's an ast for my rx-753s and this is and arrived three days ago

(Start: 00:15:27)
okay so you can see here the item arrived three days ago it's got 45 days see we can store your item for up to 45 days please consider blah blah blah otherwise the item will be discarded okay it's happened to me before i forgot to send some stuff luckily it was just magazines and if someone from japan is watching this i humbly apologize for that that was completely my bad since then i have been religious and sent everything and i almost forgot a model called of the day but i sent it on the last day and it made it back now this just went for sake is that's actually taking me directly to yahoo japan so this this is the auction side if you had to go to it your auctions and yeah you see it's like what the are they saying this particular turbo timer is one of the very first that came out this is from the 80s it buy a brand name called ultra i actually i have some ultra parts and it's really old school i mean you

(Start: 00:16:28)
can see it's just got an on off switch with a little led and then you can set up to two minutes the weight up and it's really basic but it's got the manual probably yeah goes ashton got some japanese dude uh yeah crazy and i remember he said that it came out of an old skyline r31 it's actually got the harness so that's cool i'm i'll pick up a lot of stuff just for the sake of getting it and because it's cheap that's what i do so with regards to shipping you would select your item now unfortunately i only got one and it will just pop up and they'll be multiple and you can click on them and they'll tell you shipped to your address and then you click next and if you add multiple things it'll just combine everything so this boost controller there was a plan fee it was a domestic fee and there's a

(Start: 00:17:29)
payment fee so charge your payment fee on your deposit which is 200 yen then there's a plan fee this plan fee is the proxy fee and there's insurance and stuff involved there so if the item doesn't get to you you can claim back domestic shipping that means like i mentioned earlier sending from a place in japan like hokai to tokyo where the warehouse is at okay so there's always a domestic fee and that's one thing i forgot to mention watch out for the domestic fees okay i think we may still have one open from a company called power group no okay but basically go take a look at these and go see if they're listed in here yeah shipping can only be done in sundays if payment is confirmed will be the next thing please know that i've started shipping is your monster transport fee okay i've worked that that your matter transport fee is about 800 yen okay just from previous uh dealings and

(Start: 00:18:30)
just look through all of them they'll tell you okay they'll ship a letter pack bubble wrap let the pack bubble wrap is cheap it's like 500 yen but some of these go up guys there's a company there that sells and they bid on oh sorry not that they they sell used japanese parts nick don't get me wrong i got lots of cool and i have bought from them before so i am appreciative but their shipping is expensive they send domestic shipping like 1800 yen for something that i know would have only cost like 400 500 yen to shop domestically so it's sad to see stuff like that but check your shipping make sure that your shipping is good going back to those those are your charges so it's a thousand and twenty yen before actually leaving to south africa it's 150 round then you've got to select what you got surface mail there's no tracking on surface mail whatsoever okay it takes about three months i've sent some stuff surface mail before and it has all arrived here and i'm like mind blown

(Start: 00:19:32)
that it has and i've continued to use surface mail however we're in the middle of global pandemic and surface melt may not reach here in an adequate time and may get lost which is scary because i've seen probably five to six items on surface mail because i was being a cheap ass that being said i started moving across to things like ems and dhl but you got email emails a little bit quicker but it still uses japanese posts there is tracking however and it starts adding up you can see the price went from 150 right now it's almost 400 bucks ems uses the post office now that's door-to-door shipping i've i've personally had an item that came through about a month ago i used ems and the post office sapo south african post office actually drove here dude cameron's super friendly probably the best delivery service i've ever had i got an sms the two three working days before and it said you need to pay customers for you of like 60 70 ran

(Start: 00:20:34)
pay that fee and your delivery will come through didn't give me a time it was fun i'm working from home i'm not leaving the house i haven't left as much on the essential stuff i'll go out and um he set up the gate and i went out and hey there's my package she has money give him a tip and that was it so surprising to see that it was the first time i've ever used ems and now i've used dms for my largest packages coming through the one with the two boost controllers the three gauges and a whole lot of japanese toys stickers and banners and now the post office is slowed up again because of the pandemic instead of coming through in two weeks it may possibly take eight weeks to ten weeks i'm a little bit bleak because i wanted that gauge for the gtr because i left dashboard open this is what it is dhl has been amazing but it is expensive so you can see the price is about to double boom prices doubled okay for something so small

(Start: 00:21:34)
dhl however will get your item to your door within four working days unbelievable from japan to your door in south africa me i'm in durban if you enjoy it you're pretty good in three days amazing fedex i wouldn't bother with fedex anything larger than a 34 by 24 by nine they will triple the price okay that package that i sent it was 20 000 yen for dhl and it was about 8 000 for ems or 9000 for ems and then fedex was like 40 000 yen for the same type of service goodbye tonight right all of that being said that's a lot of information i'm hoping you guys maybe learned one or two things but i've i've had generally good service i know there are a lot of other sites out there like kruber and you know there's i wouldn't say clones

(Start: 00:22:36)
of this this is probably a clone of one of them but i've always had good service i know this one's slightly more expensive you'll find at other websites you can actually do a search what is the best and the cheapest proxy site out there and you'll find that payment fees might not be 200 or they might not have payment fees you'll just pay for a plan for you like 300 and i know there's a cheaper one but i've always had good service these guys it's not a huge amount of money it's like 60 70 rand that i'm willing to pay because they package the stuff you can take a look in this video when i unbox some stuff that packages stuff so nicely in a box they they took everything out of their own domestic packaging and they sealed it and they labeled it and brilliant brilliant print so that is it that is how i buy all my stuff i pretty much buy everything for my cars from japan.c.jp and i use right-hand drive japan as well rhd japan if i need new parts and i can't find second-hand ones or things like filters you don't want to buy so you can

(Start: 00:23:36)
filter so hk super powerful filters about brand new and i bought some extra stock it's all in japan that is it for the video um hoping you guys learned something let me know in the comments section if you want to see more videos like this if this actually helped you and um let's chat drop me a comment love to chat if you want to talk on instagram or on my discord there is an official discord it's full jdm ping me at me i don't always read the stuff that's going on in there but if you want to chat at me in there thank you so much for watching the video see you all in the next one you

Title: The Most Expensive JDM Cars Sold At The Auctions! Subaru S201 | R34 GT-R | Mitsubishi Evo 6 | R33

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome to the very first video of 2021 that means happy new year compliments of the season and all that goodness i hope you're keeping safe and everything is going well or if not hopefully i can distract you for a little bit in this video we're going to be looking at the most expensive cars sold in japan in december of 2020. and let me tell you something i found some real gems and the probably the rarest car that i have seen in i don't know six to eight months so kicking it off in absolutely no order whatsoever and just quickly gotta tell you this i have not seen all the additional pictures i've seen two pictures of each car and the price and i've gone by price so i don't know what's coming the first car my list is a mitsubishi gti was sold for almost 19 000 us dollars 1999 model 62 000 kilometers that is nothing for a car that old it's a 3.5 grading cc so it's just dead average remember a brand new car

(Start: 00:01:00)
interior exterior 3.5 that's your overall grading goes up to 5 5 is a brand new car yeah i pretty much never see that of these older ones so 3.5 did average i mean that's cool here it is hell of a wing this is stock as far as i know there's an etc on the dash there's a huge tweeter on the dash as well look at that at least i think that's the tweeter stock seat stock steering wheel jeez stock wheel or stock exhausts how's that logo on the back of the circle this is a timepiece 61 807 kilometers i can't read japanese this is a twin turbo variant it's the whole little draw variant it's cool on to the next one what do we got oh we've got a subaru this is an str version five it uh isn't the two door which would

(Start: 00:02:02)
have fetched a lot more money if it was the same type of grading so this is a full grading overall it's very good interior is a b that means it's great 51 000 kilometers i mean i always think like how does an owner [Music] have such low mileage on the car but they're nothing again like i'm one of those so this thing's got stock wheels stock wing it's really cool if you're watching any from south africa we didn't get these we we just got the gc8 gt turbo as they call them which she said she has a wrx at the end of the day wow that's cool so there's the etc it's got an aftermarket for double den player seats are stopped nice everything is neat so that's a cool car oh and then we got this thing so this doesn't technically sell it didn't meet the reserve it started at

(Start: 00:03:04)
the auctions at 23 000 us dollars and it didn't sell it got up to 33 000. i wonder what the reserve was it's called 7 000 kilometers on it it's an s13 we didn't get these in south africa either for grading cb let's take a look at this guy wow that was so cool this is a genuine top piece oh my god look at this look at this this is like a brochure stuff beautiful i wonder are these seat covers i think these are covers look at that it's our twin unit oh my gosh look underneath like where was this car kept was like in a hermetically sealed environment

(Start: 00:04:05)
crazy so got up to 33 000 u.s dollars i mean that's a lot of money it does a lot of money okay another one didn't sell um it started at ninety five thousand two hundred twenty nine nine us dollars and it went up to ninety five thousand five hundred and fourteen so like 290 ish dollars difference and then nobody else put it on the car 65 000 kilometers pretty neat unfortunately there's only two pictures of the car but i mean 34 off the market exhaust it's got a stick on the back i don't know what stickers about looks like it's riding on stock suspension it's got off the rocket wheels on it i don't know what this is but it's had a replacement part here a couple couple small issues i need to write home about that's cool oh i did click through this one because i recognized that it was a limited edition card so this is the car that i said was

(Start: 00:05:07)
incredibly rare and i mean i've seen some things like acoustics coming on i've seen a 22b on in 2020 but something like this where they made very few of these subaru's this is not a body kit so this is a s201 variant of the subaru it was a special edition and it didn't sell started at 33 000 us dollars got up to 37. i wonder what the reserve was but a lot of people don't like this especially because the colors are mismatched on these bumpers but it is incredibly rare i mean you can see here it's like a gunmetal gunmetal gun metal and silver and this car i believe the boost gauge was in stock everything else is stock stock seed stock trims stock dials str seats that's cool

(Start: 00:06:10)
here's the emblem is s201 it'll tell you the number on here which one it is i don't know i can't see dirty camera dust particles floating around wow i mean that's cool that i'm not i'm not a huge fan about it but it's just so rare that i had to mention [Music] it and then we've got the arch nemesis the mitsubishi evo six this one sold for twenty thousand five hundred us dollars and actually sold for a chance the last few haven't been sold uh grading force above average cc uh not a lot of damage at all so it's got some light scratches and small dent and that's about it so thus it's uh it's not a tommy mac a lot of them are tommy mac uh garage our beard never heard of them whatever

(Start: 00:07:11)
he's got a roll cage in the car he's got wind up windows so this was an rs model that's it so the rs model was missing things like air con didn't have air conditioning it didn't have electric windows and there were a few minor other things i think it was abs that it was lacking we might be able to see on here let's see it's got abs i'd honestly i don't remember it was lacking a couple things and the reason they did that is because of uh weight reduction and that's really it and the rs model you you pay more for it i don't think it was much more but you pay more for it you get this rally spec that's lighter and yeah cooler i don't know honestly if the roll cage was stuck i don't remember but this car comes with a box i don't know what's in the box that that

(Start: 00:08:12)
could be a shipping issue if let's say it's a box of spare parts it could be a shipping issue you cannot send a vehicle down to south africa or export from japan rather with parts in the vehicle or loose pots and it's illegal to do so so you'd have to send it by a container or shopping dhl fedex et cetera et cetera okay this is on the complete other end of the spectrum the silica sold for 29 usd years 29 us dollars i 450 rand i mean you can't even fill your tank of your car in south africa with the amount of money that this guy bought his silica for and the guy who sold it i feel really bad for because it probably cost him more than 29 to get there to actually get a fully fledged inspection he had an inspection done on his vehicle it wasn't one of those shitty sheets that just say the vehicle is for sale he had it inspected and

(Start: 00:09:13)
showed all the issues it taught it told you what's wrong with the car etcetera e exterior so that's not a great exterior and a d interior not great either but 29 us dollars for this car it is the crappy one it's it's got the uh i think it was a 5s fe engine or maybe the 3s ge but it's front wheel drive and it's boring and it's sold for 29 us dollars but we can't bring them in south africa because they're not deemed as collectors or collectible vehicles unfortunately let's figure out throw it in there anyway then we have this rz twin turbo super 36 000 us dollars d exterior c interior so average interior 3.5 average for everything it's actually really good considering mileage one but i mean if you look at so it's got 122 000 case and then you look at the damage on the car it's really not that bad so i think it's

(Start: 00:10:14)
pretty clean for what it is it's an aftermarket bumper probably stock suspension it's got these funny they're not gano doors they are [Music] another name the side mirrors whatever that's got those side mirrors got a mobile race wheel it's got a tachometer here for some reason that is a gritty is it an aic it's an air control system i've actually just picked one up from japan for my little collection that i don't know what it is and then it looks like it's got a bunch of def e gauges i don't know it could be random gauges razor gear knob s14 in the background broad seat bread i don't know what this is [Music] still away what's it still wear oh it's got a big ass gritty t-88

(Start: 00:11:16)
single turbo hot damn this thing would have been beast we can't import them sucks mr2 aw av aw 11 sold for 16 000 us dollars b overall grading interior exterior so we're looking at another timepiece here mileage a little bit higher 88 000 if you want to call it a timepiece but here it is i always wanted one of these it kind of reminds me of the nissan xer that was my mother's first or second car and this an exo kind of reminds me of that and the interior on this crazy i love these old-school interiors old-school japanese interiors everyone knocks on them they're so cheaply built whatever i think gives character i really do

(Start: 00:12:17)
and then we're looking at the younger brother and the better brother that i have i also have an mr2 but mine is the g limited version and this is the gts so this is the turbocharged variant the 3s gte engine 3.5 d overalls are not so great so for almost twelve thousand us dollars the bonnet is either not lining up properly or not closed i think it's not closed probably batteries it went it's got the standard fog lights in it aftermarket wheels it does look like it has a slight drop probably springs and i need to fit my lip just looking at this car i do have a look like this i need to fit it it's got a dual exhaust system a one exhaust with two exits just like mine and then this is the old one i've got the new rear thing it's nice it's neat and themselves a hell of a lot of money huge bang for buck it's got the stock exterior that is impressive

(Start: 00:13:18)
huge bang for buck with these vehicles they're quick and nice to drive they're super fun to drive actually it can be scary at times but they're fun i mean even my mark 3 is ge one it's 120 22 i think it's 122 kilowatts and it is by far the slowest car that i own but it's probably the most fun and i've seen it time and time again and i'm not changing my mind rx-7 fd3s got a 4 with a cc this is a type a with 94 000 kilometers 36 000 us dollars a lot of money for an fd but it is a type a so it's one of the last ever built uh yeah there we go 2002 model white dials our stock this is it's got the the mazda steering wheel not the iphone stereo but it is an rd wheel which is cool same seats that i've got in mine look

(Start: 00:14:19)
like slightly better condition than mine and then those bbs wheels on them i forget which variant they are and then that super cool wing that i still need to get from one aerial is up so the radio is working it's power radio power aerial so the radio must be on there it's on as a stock radio this is cool see if i have this car i wouldn't touch it like at all i just drive it once a year ah another fd 46 000 on this type r has 21 000 kilometers again one of the last build it's got an a grading so it basically means that it's brand new all around paintwork is it immaculate there's an issue on the left hand side door so i forgot w means i think w was it's not a dent w is something i forget i haven't done an auction thing

(Start: 00:15:21)
in three months wow look at this interior that was so cool i wish i had these seats i mean it's the same they're the same type of seats that just look a bit cooler and all of these fds had leather seats in the back no matter what type of seat configuration they had they all have black leather seats in the rear unless you're in the united states and you had a big sound system and then we got an r33 here this is a v-spec which is very common actually to get a v-spec of 33 for bc very very good condition semi-high mileage 123 000 kilometers stock exhaust i think i think it's stuck i may be wrong a stock wing obviously reinhardt i don't know that's not stock that's not stock steering wheel may not be stuck nope it's an rd wheel it's not stuck

(Start: 00:16:22)
oh that that's like some sort of an rpm lock maybe not stock seat don't even know what make this is it could just be reupholstered repulsive cg i might be like how these dudes just like duck quickly they're taking the front of duck okay that's burning bad [Music] cool 37 500 euros and the final two vehicles are gtrs i think twenty eight thousand two hundred and two twenty eight thousand eight hundred twenty nine dollars three point five cb 113 000 kilometers same color as my car underneath the blue plasti dip mine looks like this mine is a little bit lower though i do have queer levels i do have the same front bumper with matching painted look and then yeah i've got all the little few in one extras

(Start: 00:17:23)
so the wheels are not stock the exhaust is not stock the steering wheel is stuck the radio is not stuck white dials these are the nismo dolls there we go doesn't matter that's cool this is my clock's cool stock seats it's got raised wheels and it's got oil and suspension so it's probably not coilovers just springs uh electronic torque collection system see it's got the nismo dash 320k ph dash it's nice it's all for 28 000. oh and this one that's not a gtr skyline 2000 gt kgc 10 sold for 61 000 us dollars i don't know much about these cars is it a gtr that is a gt on my bed i don't know much about them i know that the cooler one is the kp gc10 cooler looking in my opinion those look

(Start: 00:18:26)
great i mean you could buy a house with the money that they they spend on this car looks pretty much rust free stock wheels oh look at the plate that's like legible how's that 120 horsepower at 6000 rpm the length of the car 2000 cc this this had the um i was going to say srt i think it's the s20 engine i think screams beautiful and boys and girls that is it for the video i hope you enjoyed it again thank you so much for tuning in really appreciate it i will try and be a little bit more frequent with these uploads and uh 2021 let's go [Music]

Title: The Hard Truth About My RX7 FD3S
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM1w6Q-oHJs

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the vlog as you can see by the title there was a little bit of bs that was spun in the last video and i figured i'd just bring out the truth um basically i started the car with the whole set with the big red whole set turbo that is over here right the car did start so i managed to get the whole set on i did it all by myself and uh one thing i left out of the video i guess it's not so much it's just what i wanted really is every flipping video that i've made in the last i don't know six months there's always been either one an issue two there's been some sort of drama where my one of my kids are sick or you know something that's always been holding me back and i didn't want to end this video with bad vibes and that's really it i just i didn't want to end the video like that and what happened is the car started you guys heard it in the video however there were two issues one the manifold was glowing red hot again

(Start: 00:01:00)
and i was very bleak about that and i left it out of the video i left it out of the edit it was also smoking so there was smoke coming around the manifold and was coming out of the the turbo side anyway um enough to exhaust a lot out the exhaust the other thing is my idle was at about 2k rpm and anyway i didn't i didn't mention any of this in the video because i got the car running i had the turbo on there's a little bit of an exhaust leak as well that's the third thing that was an issue however i'm filming this now because one i wanted to bring up the truth and uh there were issues it wasn't it wasn't all happiness in the previous video but i've managed to fix most of them the other issue that i had is that i couldn't flip and rev the thing again i had that

(Start: 00:02:02)
same rev issue except it was slightly higher up in the in the rev range now in the previous video you i did manage to revive the car quite high but there was a trick to that and it's always been that way for the last couple i don't know over a year with the single server story is that i used to have the two and a half 3k rpm issue i couldn't rev and this now became like a three and a half k and i couldn't rev uh but uh if you do it when the car is cold you can rev it's when it warms up you can't i'll fix that though for real i'll fix the glowing manifold fix the idle and i can rev now what did i do i had a long chat with batik hello gavin uh we've we've been back and forth for like two years now on youtube um and uh it really came down to tune so one vacuum was an issue and i knew that it was an issue because

(Start: 00:03:04)
i left this vacuum off when we were doing the filming because i didn't have this part work in place and i figured it wouldn't be a problem because it was a map sense i didn't know it was going to shoot the rpm all the way up so that was me being stupid the issue with the manifold is that it was running insanely rich so i was getting you know i did film some of this and pretty much everything was done off cam so i've been um in and out for the last three days starting the car up annoying the neighbors of the car it's very loud and i do feel bad but i i need to get the car running and it's running now which is great um so i didn't film all of it but what i did manage to capture is my ifrs were incredibly rich low down and what i did was uh with the help of gavin he taught me a couple things and i started making some changes on the map and we brought the fuel trim down on the base map specifically in the low ranges where

(Start: 00:04:05)
there's no boost and whatnot so i threw the map watch on and i was able to see on the apex powerfc software or fc edit that it was showing where which cells were being targeted when i blipped the accelerator and i then decreased the fuel well first of all i decreased the fuel on idle because it was sort of popping up everything there and i decreased the fuel and i was it was like 11 afr and i decreased that it was just too rich and now i'm happy at about 13. so my idol's slightly lumpy baitsick has helped me out to gavin has helped me out with one of his maps i do have split timing now and i've got a few added extras and one of them was changing the fuel i'm still running the stock fuel pressure regulator i'm still running the stock injectors primary and secondary stock stock fuel pump i don't even have the resistor mod done i've still got the resistor in the back anyway it was just running pig rich at idle and remember

(Start: 00:05:05)
i'm missing a lot of solenoids now i've taken a lot of stuff that was used for emissions control and all that so it would have been lean on the twin turbo setup on idle letters and now all that that crap is out and it was running pig rich so we decreased that and my manifold stopped glowing at one stage i had under 11 it was like 10. eight ten point nine ten point eight ten by nine i might be on i might have caught on camera uh and then it also went up to about eleven point eight and then my manifold stopped glowing it was just cooking inside there plus that coupled with the high rpms um yeah so those two are sorted the other issue was when i was hitting that rev barrier at three and a half three k ish my afros were going leaning yeah leaning out to 17.5 18. it was not good at all so it was just

(Start: 00:06:06)
not enough fuel and i found those cells with the map watch again and i was logging everything and uh i just chucked a bit more fuel at it across the range obviously i'm not targeting any boost right now being parked in the garage so everything is i think the right terminology for it is a closed loop and i threw more fuel at those ranges that i was targeting i did it slowly slowly i managed to get the car cops about 5k and then i started tracking more fuel and then i could rev up to 8k freely and it sounds amazing and i didn't take my camera then and but it's working and i figured out that it's just tune at the end of the day it's just the damn tune now that being said there was that little bit of bs in the previous video where everything was hunky-dory it wasn't and what went through my head is that i should sell this car and it really did go through my head actually for the first time i went to my wife and this is for the first time since

(Start: 00:07:08)
being married and having a family i actually said to i want to sell one of these jdm cars this one the silver rx-7 because i cannot get it right and and i told her i think i'm stupid and i see that i think i'm dumb i can't fix the car i've had some other people help me but everybody's been remote helping me and it's difficult and i appreciate everybody's help jason and sweden jason in the uk we haven't spoken a lot uh gavin basic i mean guys i appreciate every single little bit of help that you've given me over the months and years actually it's been off the road for over two years now and it is coming to an end where i can now drive it that two and a half 3k issue that driving it would have been an issue if i wanted to get onto the road because the car just buck and bang and whatnot and i'll be able to battle to get up hills now i can do that so now i'm buttoning the car up because i want to get on the road we're legit going to get on the road now i've been sorting out my boost piping

(Start: 00:08:09)
i'm almost done oh and i forgot to mention that i had that solenoid uh sorry that relay that i ran at the back uh for the coil pack i pulled all that off and the car is running beautifully without it so i'm stoked about that the other thing is i needed to get new pop work now the old pop work was here excuse the mess 76 volt 76 mill 90 degree bin now this is now 63 mil oh sorry that was for the other side the other one is this is the old one see that's 52 mil to 76 and now this is bigger this is 63 to 76 i need to trim it down here so it sits more more down so this will come down in line with here almost yeah anyway you get that yeah i need to fix that i still have an exhaust leak and i think it's coming from [Music]

(Start: 00:09:09)
down pops out over here somewhere so i'll sort that out before i get on the road and then this side was also 63. this wasn't sitting happy i had this piece like that and i couldn't get the clamp around here and it was kind of sitting like on the side of the pipe instead of on that side of the pipe and it wasn't pretty at all so now i've got that nice 63-76 bull bin i need to button everything up i'll start throwing clamps on my fan's work both fans work i do have some video footage of that my list my clamps i need to just sort of my clamps neaten relay i'm actually going to pull the whole relay out gold tape on the lam is done my hk's evc i am going to throw in this one with a display i have a display here somewhere [Applause]

(Start: 00:10:12)
okay i'm gonna throw that one in for so much stuff coming from japan it's actually insane i've been waiting for months now but there's so much stuff coming and it's just going to fill this whole area up with japanese crap gauges boost controllers blah blah i've got like four boost controllers on the way um yes last bit of the update i noticed a bit of a ramble video last bit of the update i pulled out the solenoid it was sitting at the bottom there taking up space that is the fuel purge control valve that kind of takes air away from the fuel tank um i've got a venting at the moment here's the charcoal canister and all that stuff see that at the bottom there um i'm just going to block it off this people say on the forum you need free emotions control i don't have emission issues here and whatever it's just going to work i mean i'll speak to baitick about it it's just it's fine just do it so cut the shorteners then i close my bonnet put all that goodness back on but clean up i've got another ast arriving that's the stock one

(Start: 00:11:12)
that's been chilling there and i don't like the positioning so what another ast coming hmm that's that's about it that's about it button everything down and i'm gonna get it on the road my rx-7 is now looking good it's looking better and i really am stuck now i really am happy so to everyone that's helped like i mentioned a few names and if anybody else that have forgotten i'm sorry but uh thank you so much for all the assistance i'll see you next one peace

(Start: 00:00:00)
what is up guys and welcome back to the vlog we're going to be doing some exciting stuff with the rx-7 i have some amazing news and i want to show you guys right now i am that much closer to getting this flippin thing running and on the road look at turbo's kind of in when i say kind of in it's not touching here anymore i took a ball pin hammer and i beat the crap out of it i'll beat the crap out of the strut look whatever i cannot tell you how many times i've pulled this thing up and down in and out whatever what i'm going to do is i'm just going to give us a little quick coat of paint i've got some silver spray spray on here i'm going to put my gold tape back and then turbo we should be good to go i bought some loctite i want to throw a loctite on these manifold balls because we're not going to attack these i don't know a couple of videos ago they they're seemingly quite loose in comparison to the rest so i

(Start: 00:01:01)
want to do some locked up in there and then get the turbo on i did a couple things off cam and oh kind of i did film it i just didn't talk this is an adapter plate made by my dad i asked them for some help um because obviously i'm not going anywhere or any essential stuff shopping i'm not seeing people etc this is an adapter for 76 mil to 100 mil and it's v-banded this is custom my dad made this he bullet machine this thing for me he even made his own clamp it's not fully tightened so you can see the gap there um what happens is the down part which is behind the corner i can fetch it now down part is 76 mil and didn't want to mate onto here and i didn't want to take it to exhaust shop to avoid possibly catching the rhino anyway that is done it sorted this is gonna not leak which is awesome then we had some issues where

(Start: 00:02:02)
this oil feed this is what was on the previous term so from here up to there was on the previous table this is 12 mil with 1.5 pitch and what this needs is 13 mil also 1.5 pitch so my data to make this adapter plate which is this thing and this thing you made that for me then i had issues again now this happened like over the course of a week i had issues where my return this is the one that he made ages ago for the previous server and it didn't want to fit so he had to grind down the sides and he shortened it a little bit so this silver piece over here why aren't you focusing the silver piece over here used to be about yay high and then this would sit about there right so he's cut that down to here and that fits in quite a bit deeper okay so he did a hell of a job here for me um that

(Start: 00:03:03)
now fits which is fantastic new so i'm gonna go ahead bolt this on i'm gonna get my placement right to figure out exactly where the turbo is gonna sit and i mean the compressor housing side but before i do any of that you can actually see i've done quite a bit of gold tape it's almost done the bottom right there at the bottom that's not done i need to do a quick i don't want to cut corners i'm going to do that start cutting throwing it on boring stuff you guys don't want to see that and then we'll jump into the serious stuff and then start up very soon getting there getting there [Music] manifold is on for all these africans that is on push tight i was too cheap to buy lock top so i bought

(Start: 00:04:03)
wins thread locker come on what's up with my there we go i believe that'll do the job um right i am ready gold tape is done i'm pretty happy i've saved just a tiny little bit because i want to patch this up i'm going to throw the table and just make sure clearances are okay again since i type in the manifold and then there's a couple things i need to still sort out but i want to save it for last and just for good measure [ __ ] that's loud this is why it's loud garage doors closed jesus turbo time okay i still need to put my return on and tighten the

(Start: 00:05:03)
feet on the top but just checking clearances so it's in a cert like that yeah boy so i've just run into my first bit of major drama i got the oil return on that's all fine turbo has been clocked i made some markings around the back uh with some permanent marker and then oh it's nice and secure compress the housing i mean it's actually tailored but now i have a problem where i'm trying to get the bolt remember i've got three studs on so i'm going to start there there and there at the back there are confidence stuff because i can't get through the manifold so that one needs a bolt going down problem is i can't put a bolt in because this view damn v yeah v dam actually adapter is in the way so i am gonna pull this whole [ __ ] out again it's in it's in for real

(Start: 00:06:03)
holy crap okay this thing is solid um i battled that bolt i really did a bit off cam i'm actually doing everything off cam tonight you guys are just getting a little frequent updates every now and again i'm gonna try and throw the down part on i highly doubt it's gonna fit it's probably gonna knock against the firewall because this has now been extended and it's a different turbo i mean there's the old shitty one on the floor i'm gonna try downpop motford but then the mud pop and everything else won't i'll have to get that sorted out but i can start closing [ __ ] up now let's go yo i am so chuffed with the setup the down part okay i'll put one bolt on over here can you guys see probably not mud pop to downpower put one bolt on just so i can get the hot and everything got the v-band on tighten it up and it's flipping perfect so it turns out that that is just as

(Start: 00:07:04)
long as this with the adapter how cool is that i was stressing my ass off that i'd have to get some sort of welding done or just get this car out to an exhaust place it's almost 10 p.m i'm gonna just throw the interview on just to see what it looks like i'm not gonna button it up now i'm gonna button up tomorrow but that means for you guys it's to happen right now i told you you guys didn't need a weight i'm back in the garage it's about two days later i've done a little bit of stuff off cam i've been buttoning up i just need to double check a list i've got a list uh check oil rotate make sure it's tired oil feed uh down pop if it's leaking um or check oil level check radiator fluid level so down pop already check now i think it's sealed i don't know where i left off in the previous video but everything mates it up 100 and i even

(Start: 00:08:04)
got the mid pop the mid pops on that's rock solid i'm like so impressed i may be repeating myself but i'm gonna do a first start i'm just gonna check a couple things check oil level radiator and all that oh and i decided to repaint this gold it's metallic gold a little bit of like glitter sparkle in it hard to see on cam uh but i did a clear coat and then also painted the brackets black looking better this is going to be the first start obviously no intake stuff plugged in no intercooler stuff like that good thing i checked out my shed my oil return was not on that was because i took this off on and off on and off at like 10 pm i'm ready for the first start let's go

(Start: 00:09:07)
[Music] oh my wife is going to kill me i'm taking so much time um yeah let me show you what i'm doing i don't even need to show you you can just listen cause i'm starting and i think i think i know why it's definitely spark plugs filed another set i think it's my third set of fault i'll put in a very old set there like

(Start: 00:10:09)
rusty tips and and whatnot and the car is doing this so it's definitely plugs so it kind of wants to start just got off the phone with midas down the road and uh they say that there's no stock and the factory is only reopening in the new year so i'm going to call a couple places see where i can get some plugs from hopefully and i will fire this up in the next video right i don't know if this is gonna work but um when the car are from japan i had these plugs in it these are br9eqp now what i've been throwing in in the last i don't know two years are these ones q just the q not p so p is platinum i don't know there could be a hundred thousand kilometers old i don't know i've thrown them in the car while throwing the leadings only in the car i'm about to start it up because i phoned five places yesterday

(Start: 00:11:10)
nobody else stuck come on you can do it of course i switched the camera off when i try i made no change and it starts up i've got a slight exhaust leak here [Music] uh

(Start: 00:12:14)
[Applause] um you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be a pro don't waste your time no more who the [ __ ] are you to tell me what to do i

(Start: 00:13:15)
don't give a damn if you say you disapprove i'm gonna make my move i'm gonna it's what i make it do cause all these opinions and all these positions they come in in millions they're blocking your vision but no you can't listen that [ __ ] is all fiction cause you hold the power as long as you're dreaming

Title: My Friends Nissan Skyline R32 Caught On Fire!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDQmr7VDWZA

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to a brand new video today was going to be quite a sad one as you can see by the title uh my friend skyline caught on fire yes it's true it happened it happened in johannesburg it's unfortunate but um it's actually it's jock jacques is the guy who gave me that big red turbo the whole set h1e that's going to be going onto my rx-7 fd3 is still super grateful for that i've spoken to jacques and he says don't be saddened he's going to build the car better than ever but i have footage exclusive footage of what happened and we're going to dive right into it not entirely sure what road this is but somewhere in johannesburg i think bononi side about five kilometers from his house he had to pull over because uh well he started losing power and the car started jerking and he wasn't sure he was just trying to feather it onto the side of the road and then pulled

(Start: 00:01:00)
over and the car burst into flames and it's pretty scary once i show you the next picture so now i saw that picture and this one and i mean he thought oh man the engine bay screwed and everything's like pretty much toast this looks really bad so i mean soft skirt is toast for sure however the damage is really not that bad so first of all before we go any further with the pictures the issue was a fuel line that popped off on this aeromotive fuel pressure regulator so be very very careful with aftermarket pressure regulators make sure your clamps are tight make sure everything's secure and then uh happy boosting so jacques and i spoke for a little bit and uh well obviously you said the car wasn't so bad and uh here's how it started looking over the course of the day like i said the side skirt is cooked beyond fried the under tray i think you call it

(Start: 00:02:01)
undertray or there's actually a word for this and i'm lost again i'm always lost four words when i switch the camera on i know exactly what this is because i pulled it off the other day so i could feed my flipping um boost gauge wiring into my gtr anyway that burnt this black stuff damn i should probably stop the edit and collect myself but whatever that's me pull up skirt luckily no damage obviously the paint is an issue here's after a decent buff it actually looks pretty good shannon's shock i don't know maybe talking to me yeah look because fortunately okay it's back up and running it's alive again revving it's happy he needs side skirts and he needs the undertray or whatever the stuff is you can see in this picture it's already been pulled off but really damage wise he got off

(Start: 00:03:01)
really lucky luckily he had that big fire extinguisher that you see in the first picture and his not his friend a nice good samaritan that's the word good samaritan pulled over with a fire extinguisher they managed to put the fire out luckily so for me i keep a fire extinguisher in the gtr it is expired i need to go sort it out i need to keep on in the fd as well and i think this is uh something we all need to take into consideration that being said i only feel that it's right that we give jacques a follow because he's uh allowed me and he was pretty keen for me to use the footage and make this video go give jake a follow jdm jumbo he's on all platforms he's on youtube he's on instagram and he's on tech talk go follow jacques give him some support he's gonna build this thing better than ever there's talk about spraying it a different color

(Start: 00:04:03)
and doing some crazy stuff in the build hit him up with a follow go take a look at his builds see what crazy stuff he's got and then since we're looking or we looked at jock's burnt out car i figured this is probably the right time to look at crashed and burnt cars in japan now i did the usual and i looked for supras and skylines and mr2s and silicas and subarus and mitsubishi evos and gtos and you name it i looked through all of them and i couldn't find any crash cars other than skylines and mr2s for some reason because the mr2s i know it's snap oversteer skylines rear wheel drive bedroom i don't know i couldn't find any crash supers i couldn't finally crash the rx7s like i mentioned at last couldn't find any other cars weird diving right into it i have got this 34 it's a four-door 34z er it's got a 2.5 or rb25 it'll be a neo normally aspirated it is for lack of better word

(Start: 00:05:03)
that was a proper proper smash um sure the driver is okay i'm not hoping he's okay something happened that area probably gorilla ended off the other front smash the back windscreen is obviously broken but this car did however sell and it sold for i don't blame them i would i actually need to find out if you can bring these cars and i'm not entirely sure you might be able to bring them in a spares cause then there's this mr2 which did sell for 381 dollars i mean that is a pretty much steel if you want to pop this off headlight covers are screwed bumpers screw bonnets screwed the side mirrors look okay wheels look okay back of the car actually looks not not so bad this will be a g model or g limiter so it's got the 3s ge normally aspirated and i mean it's so

(Start: 00:06:04)
cheap that is nothing in south african runs five thousand round six thousand round then we've got another skyline this one did sell two thousand two hundred dollars are fully automatic it will have a uh normally is an rb20 neo and it was a minor minor smash so right hand side front smash it really looks okay it doesn't look like it's affected a pillows or crumpled in any of the zones car looks good got an r rating d c d for exterior means it's pretty much bottom of the range bottom end c means very average interior r means it needs a rebuild or has been rebuilt in this case needs a rebuild then we have this gtr this one sold for 15 000 us dollars this is probably the cheapest r32 gtr i've seen sold in the last four years maybe three years 85 thousand kilometers front left smash it's got a side bond

(Start: 00:07:06)
or maybe charge speed bonnet i'm not entirely sure but some heavy damage to the front fender i think he might have spun around and knocked knocked the bit here but um i mean the rb26 on its own is going for about twelve thousand us dollars now about ten thousand us dollars these days looks like a stock interior from what i can see other than that dodgy cup holder it looks really good i mean these seats are neat steering wheel stock steering wheel it does have some issues with some stuff hanging there dashboard looks good i mean from that angle if you just have to put that right pop that back in just drive it on that side no one will notice oh there's a bit of rust there look it's not that bad it's cosmetic as long as the the rv26 is in there and the drivetrain is is intact i think you're good oh wow i didn't actually see this one

(Start: 00:08:09)
earlier so it's two and a half thousand us dollars again this is this is a manual this is good it's got an rb 20 in it 25 i mean maybe a bad night on cam shame i hope he's okay but this is ow ow okay that is really screwed it's a shock if you're watching this these are actually you got a lucky i mean you didn't have a crash but you your car almost burned down which i'm still like in shock about but this is crazy and i wouldn't watch this on anybody another skyline mr price here this is a gt model not sold probably didn't let the reserve and nobody was just not keen on it what did it start off at okay so it did go up quite a bit it started at a thousand us dollars and it got up to four eight and the average price is four one so they say

(Start: 00:09:15)
so this gt would probably be normally aspirated that's a lot of rust damage anyway you guys can see for yourselves let me bring one of these through first let's look at these these mr2s before we look at the rest sold for a thousand us dollars it's a fully automatic the front is okay the front looks great the back the skin of the bumper the bumper ow that got royally killed because this has got some sort of i don't know if it's a wrap or whatever but the car is red underneath or marine sure it must have had some serious impact a bit pricey if you ask me for especially for uh for an auto and and someone actually bought the damn car i'm i'm confused to be honest

(Start: 00:10:18)
look at this got the stock stock stereo system man another mr2 this one sold for 4 000 us dollars and it had no inspection so you don't know if it's running at all but i'd be concerned about that last one so i'll be concerned about those because the engine is in the back but luckily you got the the boot or the trunk or whatever you want to call it to kind of like protect the engine a little bit okay so if you get a front smash not so bad i mean you could have some steering issues and whatnot but okay i love this wing really do airbag popped sure this must be a later model 98 see i don't have an airbag in my mine's a 1990 model and this is probably why it picked up quite a bit it's also turbocharged version there's the boost gauge thing pretty shitty biscuits just on boost or not invest it's like a vacuum gauge

(Start: 00:11:19)
so it's got the 3sgte in it five speed i guess for that price not so bad and then the last two skylines this one's not really crashed but i thought it was just a really good price and i figured i'd show you guys anyway so 17 700 us dollars e-exterior meaning it's it's pretty poked it needs a lot of work the interior also needs a lot of work you can see by the bonnet there's extensive sun damage too it's probably reverse parked somewhere and took a beating from the sun stock exhaust stock wheels stock steering wheel stock dashboard the radio has changed it's probably one of those famous japanese radio i see them everywhere the kazario or something had them in my rx 7s and yeah i mean good price really good price and the final one is another 34 rb 25

(Start: 00:12:20)
automatic 1800 us dollars a little bit of a front smash just a tad fender screwdrizzle what is that there's a 350z left hand drive that is so weird i don't know somebody tell me in the comment section what they think this is weird weird weird car it's not in these pictures into a stock that's an order lame that is it for the video very different um but yeah like i said earlier in the video please go show shark some support uh he's pumping on tick tock jdm jumbo from there you can pick up all his links to youtube and instagram go take a look show him some love show him some support i was gonna say feeling down about it but he's not because he's in a rebuild

(Start: 00:13:21)
he's a real man i'd be crying right now that being said thank you so much for watching uh i've got my turbo back for the rx-7 for the silver rx-7 and i am starting to put everything back together today i went to the garage and i started throwing the rest of the gold tape in it and doing a whole bunch of stuff and buttoning up clamps put the radiator fans back on with my newly created loom for the stock fans because now i've got a v-mount set up so i had to lengthen that and i'm ready to beat the out of the strut tower with a ball-peen hammer to get the turbid foot snug i mean i'm not gonna go crazy and i'm going to touch it up and then put some gold tape back on so then i want to notice and for the turbo and we should be all good so i've got it back now after an adapter was made from 76mm to 100ml but that is another video i will be filming really soon i've been filming a piecemeal a little bit filming today

(Start: 00:14:22)
and uh yeah um i will get that video out as soon as possible thank you so much for the support and thank you for the patience like i said i've had issues my son being hospital and things and videos have been a little bit slow but they are coming back i'm making a comeback i am going on leave for two whole weeks finally finally finally i need a break i will be trying to get up the videos as much as i can thank you so much again i will see you all in the next one peace [Music] you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be your pro don't waste your time no all these opinions and all these positions they come in in millions they blocking your vision but no you can't listen that is all fiction cause

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjpe4eI5ozk

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome to the final episode of season two of jdm cars for sale in south africa i have got a couple special items so if you guys wouldn't mind please carry on sending me the stuff that pitches up on facebook i really don't want to get facebook so it will help me out so much so what generally happens is people kind of spend a little bit too much money in december christmas time you know holiday season and they need to make up for it and they've got to sell their pride and joy right before we dive into it i have an exclusive sale it has never been seen on the internet and it is about to show on my channel the owner contacted me directly and we we've chatted before in the past but he asked if we can if i could throw the car up so that is what i'm doing it's not a gum tree and all that yet so if you guys want it it's actually at a pretty decent price it is an rx-7 ft3s it is sa reg it looks neat so stock front bumper this is the early 98 prior decent bbs wheels i think these

(Start: 00:01:03)
are probably legit bbs wheels they look like semis at the car zone i mean it's neat there's not too much bumper sag it's very common with the old bumper that you get bumper sag there's a slide bumper soak here but it's it's not bad from what i've seen and what i have experienced with these are horrific the owner and i've spoken many times he was actually looking at buying my my seat from whichever one of my cars and throwing it in here and i was thinking about getting some bright seats bread whatever you want to call it but that never happened anyway the owners now selling the car 250 000 round negotiable it has a pretty decent build i should probably get all the info up on my other screen so this is a 93 with a street port single turbo it has a short shift kit and a few bits uh carbon lock interior bits and the gear knob and it runs really well as we like registered in his name

(Start: 00:02:04)
uh very neat interior and it has 62 000 genuine kilometers on the car and i mean you can actually see that with the bodywork and the paintwork if it hasn't been resprayed everything works the aircon is nice and cold and he has an opportunity for something else and that is why he's wanting to sell so he's looking at around 250k decent setup here with the intercooler man i already dig this i just i've never seen this before the dual dump valve but yeah cool and also you've got the fc fuller neck so you've got the deleted ast anyway if you guys are interested in this vehicle you can contact for now mark w four ten four one zero mark w four one zero on instagram pick him on instagram uh from there you'll share his details you can give him a call etc then so getting us started is this mx5

(Start: 00:03:04)
it's a turbocharged one it's not turbo by factory it's a 1990 model we actually just caught this advert right now it was priced an hour ago only 33 people have seen it it is a durbin car i think i may have seen this called a car show before i don't recall which one maybe cars in the park i don't know very blurry photos i'm not going to stay on that too long because it's really hurting my eyes um but he's got embroidered seats i don't know if there's a stock seat it's got a boost gauge i'm assuming it's a boost cage gear levers change i don't know what's hanging here and uh that hurts a lot a fairly sized turbo okay there's some there's some issues here i wonder what happened there and it looks like the hard top it's got a hot top which is a good sign has been re-sprayed i said here we go it's a gt28 size turbo is boosting bus it makes 160 horsepower so 400 horsepower is 300 kilowatts plus

(Start: 00:04:06)
minus uh yeah so this is like 120. i was i was actually second-guessing myself you've probably heard that in my voice 120 uh cause of new rings bearings seals gaskets fault ray rev counters not work requires rev amplifier windows don't worry crack on the back plastic in the dash cosmetic stuff call motion cool i'm gonna give you because you've turbocharged the car but then you've got blurry-ass photos i'm gonna give you a five six you can have a six out of ten then we have the statson 280zx really cool i've always wanted one of these and i would love to get one of these to throw in an rb20 but probably go rtbs now this looks like a pretty good example it's an automatic i think

(Start: 00:05:07)
they're mostly automatic or at least the ones that are in south africa um red interior it's very very neat i'm wondering if this has been restored or if this is all original i haven't looked at comments i'm not the comments in the description in these in these ads i'll just open them up and then i'll review them with you guys so i'm learning stuff as i'm going along and i'm just kind of looking at things and you know this car is damn neat see how the color changes and different lighting wow so interior that's good eastern cape leather interior including dashboard negotiable it's a good price it really is a good product i mean you find these can go up to like 200 plus k and then you also find them on the bottom end like 30k but that is a solid asking price

(Start: 00:06:08)
good at good pictures not so much writing it but it is negotiable and uh it's neat it really is neat i'm gonna go for a seven out of ten right then we've got this r33 gtr which isn't durban i think yeah it's in case it in c car lag so this 33 is fairly stock it's missing number plates i'm assuming it's sa registered it's got an abcr boost controller apex boost controller which is which is nice it's got a great turbo timer here i mean these photos are like very close up so you use a lot stock dash i think this car is reasonably stock so it's got apexes super powerful eggpixie power intakes i forgot the name i've actually got a set in my garage but i forgot the name nice carpet stock carpet nice whoa okay back to normal

(Start: 00:07:10)
um yeah 550 i guess it's the going rate right now and it's it's pretty much stuck i'm assuming let's look at the first picture okay he's got an exhaust it's likely a cat-back exhaust if there's just intakes in the car but then there's a boost controller who knows who knows i'm going to call this car relatively stock the right heart looks like it could be on some sort of springs or stock suspension i'll go with stock suspension so i'm going to give this bad boy a seven out of ten too whoops brand new coilover i'll probably probably read that and then we have a 200s hx so it's not exactly jdm so 180 sex would be a jdm but whatever uh this one yes that's what i clicked on the ad this is a one user's head holy crap it like just fits in there that's pretty snug wow

(Start: 00:08:14)
i mean the car is neat from what i can see in the pictures nice wheels nice drop i was about to say there's no fenders but there's defenders nice kit that's cool kind of reminds me of um i was gonna say cybon charge speed charge speed bump i used to have a charge speed bump on one of my subaru's nice 100k might be a bit too much genuine one you said it's got a w58 gearbox d4d harlax clutch it's a probably pretty solid gk tech roll center and bumpsteer correction so he's put a hell of a lot of evidence they had so one thing i understand this is 100k here it says 125k there all slips of money spent was failed and will be given with that is cool i've been so bad with my cars you know i used to do that i used to follow my stuff with my subarus like every single thing i used to keep yeah files um the only files i got now is my import

(Start: 00:09:16)
paperwork because you don't want that [ __ ] to give us and then i've got copies elsewhere yeah but uh i guess in my mind i like never want to sell my cars that's probably why i haven't collected all my slips that in life just gets in the way and i'm so busy uh anyway turn it six uh for the fat ass engine that you throw inside here i gotta give you a seven out of ten that it props to you man oh yes okay i actually saw this like two weeks back this is a hell of a deal r32 gtr dude one's four hundred thousand round that is cheaper that is way cheaper than what you can get if you had to try and import one yourself snap it up before the owner if he actually watches my videos before he hears that and bumps up the price it looks stock-ish i'm guessing this here is one of those

(Start: 00:10:17)
rear wheel controllers and all that i don't know that's just an alarming mobilizer thing gear knob has been changed it looks like there's an issue here with the backing for the ecu who knows but everything else is stuck it's got the little screw covers which is nice 123 000 kilometers quite a few little scratches but this could be the camera angle and the light and all that stock seats same like mine i've got like a blue i've got a cold weather package on my car stock carpets that one looks damaged here's what it is it's it's old it's an old car nice cheap regrettably selling my dream car sorry dude she has low mileage and never got the modif would be me uh only a few choice parts are replaced correctly imported and licensed

(Start: 00:11:18)
so clutch master that there we go ts don't say test the controller i was right i've seen one of those and i wanted one of those it's got a uni chip which is so unichip is a piggyback ecu if you guys don't know if you're watching from overseas it's a piggyback ecu they cut the wiring in between the yeah the ecu and the engine bay and they throw in a unique and it just tricks the ecu tricks all the values so it'll give a different air temperature sense value i'm losing my mind yeah airflow values blah blah go read about it i can't talk to that i mean that's nice 400k goodbye someone go and buy this car if i had the money i'll pick up another one especially the way the prices are going up 8 out of 10. aha i actually i know

(Start: 00:12:21)
of the owner we haven't actually met because i like don't leave my house because of covert and stuff um sober selling bob ross gardner so he is a picture of the super drift he built this car it's a rocket bunny 200 sx and it's got a 2j in it radiator on the back search tank search tank fuel tank that's a mr turbo radiator you guys seat i think these are auto style jobs roll cage nice roll cage oh that's cool i dig it i'll dig this car i follow him on instagram it's nice car uh that is not the tj i'm confused now

(Start: 00:13:23)
aha engine is the lexus one you said pretty sure i saw tj in there the other day anyway um rocket bunny cat asking prices 150 with this engine 170 with the trailer that's cool or 220 there we go fully forged 2jz and a cd009 gearbox uninstalled okay so that's currently not in the car there what's that only if you're interested yeah i'm not much of a drifter what is that i want to know what that is anyway uh somebody buy this car i think it's cool i think it's um cool to see a rocket bunny and then the swanked 280 zx i'm so wanked because of the bodywork who knows what's in that's a nice fuel tank damn dude that's a good setup you got there

(Start: 00:14:24)
i mean that setup alone is probably like 10 great what engine is that it's a nissan 16 volt i don't know but there's another mr turbo radiator special little exhaust housing must be a small engine must be like a 1.6 water gauge rev thing okay it's a two liter fj20 et i have no idea what car they played 20 gt35 that looks small has got a breaking problem bodywork needs attention it's got papers i don't know i guess a good project called decent price i know nothing about the engine i don't even know what it sounds like i'm just gonna go with an even steven number five out of ten sorry if i'm offending you ah remember i said earlier some of them got upwards of 200k this one was almost 300k it's got a

(Start: 00:15:24)
hundred thousand kilometers on it now this is what i'm talking about this is oh my goody aunt that's beautiful look at them apples water again that's a lot of money this is one of those cars that you just stash away cover it up don't like the price but i got to go for like an eight out of ten again ah this thing so now we're doing two miata's today this one two mx fives miata's whatever you wanna call it gt thirds 30 t-turbo it's also been turbocharged making can make 350 wheel kilowatt if running ethanol so it's running 250 wheel dude this thing must be a handful to drive rear wheel drive tiny damn

(Start: 00:16:27)
i like it i like it 150k sure look at that's that scared that is a fat pop [Music] nice nice nice amount of details in here i'm sure this thing kicks ass on the road somebody gonna buy this i wonder if you're a negotiable in the gosham you'll also consider you're negotiable someone got offered him some money this car looks good i gotta give you for the ad and everything else uh again i think this is three in a row eight out of ten really crappy screenshotted photos 300x it was 55k for it i'm just gonna like kind of skip through this one decently quick it's a turbocharged variant but but but but it's got swazi papers something for 60k negotiable he's already dropped it to 55 you'll probably get like 35k someone

(Start: 00:17:28)
will turn this into a spares car it's a normally aspirated variant and it's got front wheel drive i don't know it's cheap 29k i mean there's like 2k already just in the kenwood i don't know star sound okay maybe like one fire the rear seats are neat give you that much front seats look neat too i mean the overall the car looks neat you're getting a pretty decent bargain here for 30k except this is not going to appreciate whatsoever because it's not the st 185 variant that is turbocharged and yeah go to the 5 10 because i'm feeling generous today and not that my ratings actually mean anything then this mr2 i'm pretty sure this has been on the channel it has been on the channel i'll just remember now anyway uh this thing

(Start: 00:18:28)
does not have licensing the photos are all over the place and um yeah dude one's 45k it keeps getting cheaper and cheaper it's got no papers roll cage etc etc cool car cool car nonetheless i'm not saying that because i have one but because they're fun to drive now moving on to the final few that were sent through by subscribers again thank you i'm starting off with this r34 this car has no paperwork it's got an rb25 um i'm trying to figure out if this is turbocharged it looks like an n a this looks like an a it's got a removable steering wheel but it is a four-door just okay i mean it's not really my style i like i like the way that he set it up though it looks clean and then he wants eighty-five thousand round for it so yeah there we go it's a non-turbo rb20de

(Start: 00:19:30)
it's an ongoing project and uh i don't know what's factory read more damn hello jdm members that was that for that one um i don't know it's not registered it's it's a four-door it's an n a the price is okay i mean if you have to buy this car 10 years ago you paid like 10 grand give it a five i'm not gonna go lower than five today unless it's really shite and then here is another 200 sx this one has the engine out and dismantled he was 70k negotiable apparently it's pretty clean or very clean but yeah i guess uh i guess we'll just go for a five again it's in cape town that's all the info i have in that one and then this del sol i don't know if this is still available so this little del sol this is a cool car i would love one of these this is a honda beat i would

(Start: 00:20:30)
love to get one there's only a handful of these especially sa registers and this is i believe sa register there's actually one in durban a green one but yeah this is in gerberg and it's making decent power to vtec turbo and there was this whole shopping list of parts and it's nice and i wouldn't mind one so i'm going to go with the seven oh that's it see how bias that look at the engine bay that looks so good i think it was hardrocked up that's what really cool seven out of ten and then we have this 33 that popped up on on facebook for sale i be honest i lost the cheat with all the details i can't find it now uh your gp plates it's registered i think he wanted i think i think he wanted 110k

(Start: 00:01:01)
i was so nervous when i started i didn't actually show my face on this channel for about two years plus minus and um i've been lacking a bit of inspiration to get out and do some car stuff sounds familiar see most you guys know that we've got a two-month-old baby at home so things have been a bit tough she's okay so my daughter is four years old now she's four and a half almost so i mean this was some time ago and now i've got a six month baby i'm actually just gonna mute so this video was a video of me driving so the car is silver yeah it's spark silver this is what it used to look like and i filmed on the really old camera this is my old canon essex something i don't remember i've got a year eos m50 now with a nice microphone and all that so you can see i still got the same exhaust same wheels still that same coilovers a lot of stuff changing the engine bay but this is what the car used to look like and i'll get back there another time anyway i just thought i'd bring this video up um because it was one of my first videos where i actually set up cameras

(Start: 00:02:01)
in the car and i just i went for a random drive throughout durban and this is gear nationally that i was driving through and a lot of people recognize the area i mean south africans and i'll go through sri lanka rockstrap and i'm schlanger if you guys aren't from south africa sri lanka is very much a touristy area so we come in from sri lanka now this is somerset you can see here i parked off i set up the tripod and and i just i spoke about the car and my plans and i don't think i followed through with many of them and then i also revealed that i was bringing in this guy anyway this video i went to go pick up the car which was i talked about hauser tech he's a fellow youtuber in this in canada as i say states so i followed my old man we went to go pick up a trailer and yeah basically explained in the video that we're going to go to david port picked up the trailer we're driving through durban got some non-copyright

(Start: 00:03:05)
music playing [Music] three thousand people watch this i don't rake the views in anymore and and i know why it's because i sit at home all the time now purely because i've covered and also because i've been having children and uh i just can't get out anymore these days so everything's in the garage or in my driveway and it is it can be boring so i try to do these type of videos and inform informational videos anyway here we are we had durbin port this is the check-in my old man was talking to the guy where do we go etc if anyone ever wants to pick up a car from from durban port so you've got to drive in here and then you've got to go up here and then you do a loop and you land up at the bottom somewhere there and anyway see so we went uphill guys i was just told that i cannot film by the swedish saw the camera probably should have taken it down before i drove in here yeah anyway we went we drove into the wrong place yeah initially now let's skip a little

(Start: 00:04:05)
bit i remember this i had a reflective jacket and and over here by the breast there was um like a see-through plastic thing where you you slip in your id or or piece of paper that says what company name you're from etc um and i put my phone there and i had a recording so this this is right here by the sea as the ship's coming in these weren't the ships where my mind came from i have footage from when the rx-7 the silver x7 arrived which i never uploaded because we had issues when we were there and i got lifted in a van back to biosecurity back to the main entrance because i wasn't supposed to be there anyway um i chose not to upload that footage but the car comes up you can see how shaky this is because it's sitting on my brace pocket it's going to come through in a sec come on

[Music] oh here it comes emma see the reflective jacket it was very windy so i had to tell the car there was no fuel there was a veil side wing on the back mismatched bumper mismatched door these wheels are now on the silver rx-7 and the fnu wheels on this car i mean this was it was one of those moments in life that you'll never forget picking this up and just the looks we were getting people leaving the durban port like everyone was just looking [Music] yeah i mean look at this just driving through durban and whoever came near the car was just like wow and like i'm driving behind it so i'm seeing all these reactions and i'm watching people slowly come past people taking photos i mean this was such an epic day it was

(Start: 00:06:06)
probably not one of the the best videos around but damn that experience was like no other and this was the car it was pretty much stock except for the intakes and the exhaust but it was in your cat-back and then i swapped all the stock stuff from the silver one onto this cost and now it's officially stocked there's absolutely nothing done to this car which is rather cool then i got my mr2 i'm just having an automatic garage door i've got a manual enough like crank it up [Music] cool i love the music too many thoughts on my mind i can't sleep at night so i just keep writing gangster montages

(Start: 00:07:14)
is i had to move them around to make space it's actually when i drove the vlog today oh wow this is outside the house here now it's very different about 60 kilometers to me but i figured yes okay so i i got dropped off by the uber at uh grinrod and grinrod is in a man's attitude and i went from schlanger and grinrock brought the car from johannesburg and it was super cheap if south africans are watching and you're wondering how much it costs to get a car from from jailbreak to durban it was a thousand two hundred bucks including that unbelievable i don't know what i'm talking about but i'm gonna go pro and oh the one in the front didn't end up

(Start: 00:08:16)
recording so it only recorded the rear okay so we anyway it was just a collection video and it was my initial reactions of me driving around and just appreciating the car and i i was so stoked i mean there's there's so much happiness what is going on with 200 meg line youtube is just [ __ ] itself i remember this it was pissing with rain and i was so scared because it uh jesus garage was screwed when i was still renovating the house before we hadn't moved in um putting in new gates and all that the this car oh my gosh i i got a i forgot about this i gotta go back i'm sorry i've got to pause it there come on turn around boom jeez i remember this i i personally dug some of this hole with

(Start: 00:09:20)
a spade so my i've reclaimed all of this so this was a huge bag that came down up to this wall here i reclaimed all of this and now this is a parking spot which is which is sick i mean take a look in that picture but i just i forgot how bad they look anyway i was shooting myself in this video because i had read multiple reviews and i don't know just people complaining about snap oversteer in the mr2s and i was crapping myself because it was raining but i still gave it a little bit and then i think i was concerned about the rain going in the engine bay and like stupid stuff but this is the mr2 and it was just it was so cool picking this car up and knowing that there's not many around especially since you can't bring these in those connectors items and let's look at the car i'm going to try to keep all these cars for as long as possible oh man so in this video i take out the mrt

(Start: 00:10:24)
and i went to go troll am i wearing the same shirt i'm wearing the same shirt three years later i've got the same shirt this is i mean i don't wear this out anymore it's like faded and screwed and i pretty much leave the house so why don't we all close all this up um sure a lot has changed so i picked up a new gators new handbrake gators there's radio in the car now i've got a sub an amp in the car and i've got a sparkle wheel because this wheel is really missed i fixed the clips i did quite a bit of repair work for this obviously the front's been re-sprayed from [Music] from this pillar onwards from fenders everything has been resprayed that looks a hell of a lot better anyway i went from here to control the petrol attendant i didn't actually plan it from what i remember maybe wrong but

(Start: 00:11:24)
i'm gonna see how this goes what's wrong with the internet okay yeah so this is autumn rock straw this is the bp exterior how's it i don't need fuel uh just a tire pressure if you can 1.6 sure that was low 2.2 is fine was it he's been at the garage he's such a cool like i trust support him as much as i can he's such a good guy and he's been there i reckon good 12 years he remembers my subarus it's from jobec got it two days ago that's nice yeah it's different yeah this one's fortunate this one is what it's for chasing

(Start: 00:12:31)
[Music] can you check my oil there [Music] oil is fun i love that reaction the opposite is ah you see brother first of all you battle with a latch i love this video oil is fun so i know he calls his friends hey i got you good my engine i'm pushing with my feet there's no engine just pumping i'm just pumping

(Start: 00:13:31)
pump all day all night it must be powerful yeah no not so much not so much no i don't like the other one but it's okay hey do you like it sometimes sometimes all right thanks sir all right oh this is a cool video and then from there i kind of just took it out to do right worthy and the guys uh the guys gave me a hard time with the roadworthy and subsequently i've actually made friends with the dude the manager of this raid where the place lives stuck down the road and i always see him at food lovers market and and when we're doing shopping and he's like hey uh when you're coming to see our car i'm like i'm bought me uh he's like i almost come visit okay okay uh anyway they picked up that i had a camera on the car and you just said listen why are you recording uh this dude i asked if i want to sell the car this was a random dude but just as i was busy leaving

(Start: 00:14:32)
he flagged me down this was my favorite i know you just bought this i know you're just yeah i don't know like really i know you just bought it do you want to sell it no i don't i get this so often and the funny thing is i get this more in this particular car than i do in any of the others why i don't know ah this video [Music] cheers yeah now now how's this i had so many issues with with the fd when it arrived the silver fd i couldn't

(Start: 00:15:33)
rev past 3000 i tried everything there were like six videos of me trying different things like fuel filter um spark plugs leads i had two fds i was busy swapping from from each one but luckily with both twin turbos so not like it is now the single turbo setup i was just swapping parts to try get it working and i couldn't get it going you know we even i had ben come around and we set up a little led and for the diagnostics and we're trying to figure every damn thing out and it just we couldn't so yeah i've got an apexi powerfc which i still have to this day and i don't know what i was doing my old man's garage but i was getting some tools oh yeah ben came around too ben's got super long hair now whoa how's that edit sure i've i've lost a decent amount of weight since then and i'm sitting down

(Start: 00:16:35)
lockdown has been good to me in the weight department i lost a check that was down 11 kilos anyway stripping the stripping the ecu alright to put the fuel filter back in i swapped the entire fuel assembly from each other jesus looked crazy stuff anyway let's see i was so stupid i should have copied the map that was on the apex epic just just to see what they had on there but anyway i couldn't rev before i think this is my first ever rev's look i smoked

(Start: 00:17:37)
nothing at all so the car just stopped smoking i think i waited for the car to warm up yeah i did so i went a little while i was doing the idle down here doing that hunting wow i've got a road mark now with a dead rat thing on top so i don't get a wind noise anymore or it's not so prominent i think i'm going to rev it now yes this was such a glorious moment i should have left the car standard i should have left the bloody thing standard and just thrown on the air filters and an exhaust i already had the downpop

(Start: 00:18:40)
for the twin turbo setup i should have just stuck with the flip and twin turbo setup i've gone big single turner and i've screwed everything up i'll get it right but plenty out it was working after this [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is such an emotional time found a little bit off cam the car has been running ever since and it's still revving no problems like a bloody robot i didn't show any emotion i'll show you motion now looking back in the video i think i was just too embarrassed to show emotion back then i should have been like i was thinking [ __ ] didn't show you motion so that was cool ah so this video the abandoned r32 this this car was sitting in uh

(Start: 00:19:41)
i forgot the name of the area now damn it um like riverside river horse river horse valley somewhere around there effingham and i went to pick up gareth and we i put some suspenseful music and i mean i really over exaggerated things and i probably shouldn't have because there was really nothing wrong so i found the car on the side of the road and it was like trees and i mean plants that [ __ ] growing through and spoke to that i know i didn't want to film that and i did ask him if i could film take videos pictures afterwards which he allowed me to so here's just me just talking to the guy who's telling me if everything's there and whatever then i turn around to go look at the car and this thing was imported um yeah not so legally but it it wasn't the greater the greatest of models it's

(Start: 00:20:43)
uh it's a gt normally aspirated rb20 with an automatic gearbox but it was still cool to see and i offered the dude some money for it and he said no i don't actually don't even remember the figures i mentioned it in another video and he just wasn't keen he didn't want to budge then i offered him another amount and then a week later i hear that he just sold some other dude for less than what i was offering so i was pretty bleak on the whole thing because i did want to pick this car up and i had just got an approval from my wife to buy it and and use it as a project car and you know would have been so cool now because i've got the rb20 det that i'm busy building and it could have gone in this car and obviously done manual swap and all that goodness but this was wasteful where but if you're from south africa you know the situation that is very difficult to get a skyline in the country that is not a gtr you have to be a returning resident to spring

(Start: 00:21:43)
you wonder just import these you can bring them in for race use this one would actually have to be a race car because it's not registered and never has been registered a funny thing the panel at the back is probably worth more than what the guy paid for the car this is an illuminating panel on the rear and it was a rare option from factory that you could pick up these and i don't know if it worked or if they were broken and water inside but anyway very rare they used to go for about 600 700 dollars and that was the car really and just finding something cool like this in durban south africa of all places on the side of the road like wow mind blowing oh now this is a very special day today this was duran who's become a mate of mine we talk all the time i went and met up with russell and duran russell

(Start: 00:22:46)
so we did i did a montage and this was cool i mean the guys went crazy they went crazy in the rain in hindsight i probably should have down the music a little bit for the montage and pushed off the engine noise but it is what it is guard came running out so this s13 had a 1j in it big turbo sounded amazing i'm used to revlon 10k plus look at this [Music] it didn't really rip the 10k plus it's just it was a four cylinder now six cylinder engine in here and the speedo rev thing is completely screwed this was fun this is one of my first ever features then i did quite a few afterwards but now covered there is a lot done to it

(Start: 00:23:48)
pretty cool and then russell and duran had a little chat and it was the first time i really got to know the guys and we become friends i haven't seen russ in forever if you're watching this dude hit me up i know you're a busy man but yeah this is cool and and throughout the chat we after i threw in these uh b-roll shots and some really cool stuff throughout the discussion so you can hear that busy talking in the background and and and yeah lots of b-roll and all that it was a cool video it was my first ever feature ah this this makes me sad so this is when i broke my my clutch on the 32 i the 32 was relatively standard at this stage i mean it didn't have down parts and all that and i went to a race day and this was at matutuba and there was an mr2 that lined up against we actually just ended up speaking and he was pretty much the only

(Start: 00:24:48)
one that wanted to race nobody else was like because they all thought that i have a thousand horsepower because it's skyline at this stage it's probably running about 380 400 horsepower um yeah but actually quite a bit probably about 350 at the time anyway um so he is he was keen and the 3s gte in it with big turbo gt35 in it you know i knew he was gonna probably beat me up top so i wanted to launch hard and that is what i did and that's when i broke my clutch right here [Music] nothing in second second was dead so i led off all the way in the legs i just couldn't catch it [Music] yeah look at this well my interior has changed so much i've moved all these it's so much neater now and that piece of shit's out look there nothing like no power you can

(Start: 00:25:50)
see those ribs there let's go back watch my rev counter change the second nothing and then i kicked something in killed my clutch and since then my first guess i've been a bit screwed i need to throw an ice kick in and then i tried racing this thing after i didn't realize that i smoked my clutch at that time after that right i thought something else had gone wrong and i went through the car and i mean i didn't smell clutch or anything so i decided to just give it another go and i the car of new one to pull off [Music] so yeah i tried to pull off dead no power and i just said i'm done and i cut it and that was it for the day much sadness

(Start: 00:26:50)
oh okay when my black fd came oh jesus how's this intro a lot has changed um when my black fd arrived it was dirty and not dirty full of mud it was full of pubes weird pubes and just have a listen the rx-7 and we decided that we're going to try and get the electronics working so this car came with so much crap it had the screen and had these cup holders it had an ecc it had some solar panel thing here i don't know what it was charging it had some microphone here there was there was like four microphones in this car yes it's an automatic i picked it up super cheap dirt cheap this radio didn't work at all i picked it up dick cheap and it was just covered in pubes this piece of [ __ ] cd player in the front the car nav with a t good tidy up planning on doing that now i started stripping all sorts of stuff out of this car but then i think i'll start showing i had a six disc shuttle in the back a

(Start: 00:27:52)
dvd player in the back sorry but it was full of pubic hair and pube hairs all over the car underneath carpets all over the place in between the seats i've forgotten my camera not that that the camera is much good but i was filming with my sony xperia phone which at the time didn't have a decent camera either compared to these days it is so [ __ ] manky he has in between the seats look at that there are just pubes everywhere [Music] that ever happens you can take my word i want to apologize that's just absurd i forgot about that edit oh my god pretty sure this dude whoever owned the car got down in the car we didn't know that we could actually flop down the seats so the back seats are down right now i'm pretty sure this little asian dude got down and dirty in this vehicle so we don't have any gloves we don't have anything yeah we just got a bunch of tools we're busy stripping the [ __ ] out okay i've cleaned this car up a lot

(Start: 00:28:54)
i've really done it justice it's now completely stocked there's nothing changed in the interior except for the the doubled cd player that's in there now and uh i fixed a lot of things i'm stuck the way that it's come through but it was so manky when it did arrive here oh my god anyway that was that i mean the rest of it is just cleaning up and ripping up everything okay i just found something so if you guys remember there was a video of castle sales africa recently and there's this class will sell for 240 000 rand this exact car was for sale oh yeah i was talking about the beta main heart phenomenon you guys can read what it's about um basically i got my x7 and i started seeing rx-7s everywhere this rx-7 it's for sale for 240 i can

(Start: 00:29:55)
see toilet paper reflection 240 000 rand right now a buddy of mine has just bought this car yes he's just bought this car and i think you pick it up tomorrow actually it no longer has a rotary and it's now got a one jpeg turbo and excited to see and uh maybe let me do like a little feature uh stand far away i don't know but yeah cool fenders front bumper is exactly the same front bumper that i've got it's like a feed style bumper a veil side wing the same wing that i've got i'm not using that wing and yeah that's that's the one weird old couches so weird seeing stuff like this oh no i'll just let you guys watch wait context i send my car away to get places but it was kind of like a month guys i don't know how much longer i could take of this it's been almost a month without the gtr

(Start: 00:30:58)
see it was almost a month a whole month of just rotary action and a turbocharged listen see i have the same way without the gtr i've just felt alone i haven't felt like myself i gotta skip some of this it's so incredible i'm wanting to feel some twin turbo boost my acting was really bad back there i hear something oh yeah it sounds like a straight six [Music] i just like i can't be here anymore i just need to leave i just need to go [Music] i mean it was a good idea but it was this very cheese this is the first time i actually showed

(Start: 00:31:58)
the color on the channel guys my gtr [Music] it looks so weird missing that that black nismo piece that i've got on now the plastic would look good [Music] 600 horsepower yeah well that never happened i probably gained like 50 afterwards um i did have big plans for this and then never took off because i um started growing the family and bringing in the other jdm cars i'm already bothered i still think she'd need to finish a couple of things on

(Start: 00:32:59)

Title: RX7 FD3S Turbo is out!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e8Vd7B4c9Q

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey what's up guys and welcome to the video this is a little bit of a weird one i kind of filmed this video over five or six days it's all over the place i just got to apologize for that now but i figured i can't let good content go to waste the rx-7 is right next to me things are moving on but you got to watch the videos to figure out what's going on before we start watching and you're probably wondering why i'm wearing gloves if you're not following my tik tok you wouldn't know it's a whole bunch of stuff around from japan blitz exhaust temperature gauge with the sensor with some random lighting you figure out what that is about then i've got some gradient gauges and controllers also exhaust temp oil temp controllers but no sensors i'm going to try to find the sensors separately so it works out a lot cheaper i mean i paid like a thousand yen plus minus for both a little godzilla figurine this is gonna go on the gtr dashboard just to you know spruce it up a little bit and then i got myself a grady perfect b

(Start: 00:01:01)
that's perfectly yes it does perfectly decent to the controller itself it's missing the actual solenoid and all that but i happen to find a solenoid separately so now i picked that thing up for like 500 yen solenoid i don't remember i think it was like maybe two thousand two and a half thousand yen add the two together i've got a boost control for three thousand yen that is nothing what's up guys welcome to the vlog i'm gonna head off to my old man's place i need to make a tool basically that we need to bend the spanner i can't do it here i don't have aussie cellular so i can't heat it up with the torch um yeah we're gonna have to do this on it like somebody wanted to gave up on the die cause i never got it my way never got my mama whip on the driveway i been making our hits on a friday back then i was getting like no plays i'm never gonna change no kanye

(Start: 00:02:02)
gotta get a lamp yo i managed to get the the turbo out here's the bin spanner didn't use that that was a piece of [ __ ] yeah you guessed it i pulled out the entire bloody manifold let me show you why i couldn't get to so annoying first of all let me show you the new turbo again hexagons see the bottom on the t4 thingy i can easily access the rear bolt the rear right-hand board i can sort of get to that one and then i can get to that one so this one's a lot easier to fit and take off without having to remove the manifold this however yeah i bought this one second hand but it's got some sort of a plate at the back so you can't get in from the back here's the flip and bolt now look at those [Music] look you've got to come in at a weird angle that sort of fits but then you don't have any play crazy crazy crazy

(Start: 00:03:05)
so that was a story that's why i couldn't get on manifold's out i'm gonna remove this i'm gonna pack this turbo away probably get it repaired or something i don't know and then i'm gonna throw the manifold on first then try mount the turbo see how that goes if it fails pull the manifold out mount it all together throw it on and then uh i'm gonna focus on doing a garage clean up today before i carry on filming this vlog is such a mess all over the place spanning over a couple days um i'm on the way back to my father's place because he's gonna make some adapter plates for me i actually don't even remember if i said in the last video but this is 76 mile and the back of that is 100 mil he's going to make this piece that's got a flared cylindrical thing with the 76mm and 100ml on the other side it's not exactly 100ml uh three inch and four inch that's what we're going to sort out and then i'm also going to pick up a ball peen hammer [Music] uh thanks to everyone in the um

(Start: 00:04:06)
instagram and tick tock comments let me know to beat the [ __ ] out of it instead of grinding i'm new to the stuff i mean if you og's in the channel you'll know that i started working on cars when i started this youtube channel never worked on cars before so thanks for the advice appreciate it uh let's go [Music] all right guys thanks for watching this weird little video i will see you all in the next one when the turbo goes in and hopefully we can probably start up the car in the next video let's see how it goes take from there peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be a pro don't waste your time and all these positions they come in in millions they blocking your vision but no you can't listen that [ __ ] is all

(Start: 00:01:01)
anyway this car still for sale it's been for sale for going on three weeks now no one's buying it i don't know what's up if there's anything after the call but you probably get a deal if you negotiate with them who knows then we got the old 300 zx that has popped up on the channel there's a price drop is now 38k anyway it was a lot more expensive than what it is now 38k bars your 300zx i'm not going to run through all of it there's missing a window it's an automatic uh tires need to be pumped up apparently those driving drive and go it is registered i don't know decent project car personally i'd offer like 30k but that's just me this 1jz powered rx-7 gorgeous absolutely gorgeous actually the same bumper that i just picked up for my car identical bumper so cool to actually see this the wing is the same wing that i had on my black fd and then i took that out and put the stock weight on now this is one jz powered there we go

is basically an is-200 with a different engine the lexus is 200 that is this one is botswana ridge meaning we can't register it here illegally i mean you could probably do a dodgy deal with someone and turn it into lexus is on paper but by the way if i sound a bit congested it is because i am i think i'm coming down or something um hopefully not corona anyway this has the 3s ge beams motor so it is very decent standard cool car problem is con registered like i said it is negotiable upon viewing so 40k probably get it down to maybe 35. so i'm gonna have to give this because it's an import and because there's not a lot of information but it is it's a stock car so disregard that there are a decent amount of photos it is an import i'm going to give this a 5 out of 10. then bringing up another golden oldie

(Start: 00:04:06)
this one it's a 300x it's an 84 model it has 227 thousand kilometers it looks like it's been sitting for a little while inside a tent uh fortunately for the car has been sitting on some wood and uh unfortunately for this vehicle and whoever buys it next it is an automatic however the price is not bad engine looks clean v6 three liter car isn't very good condition this bus it's h i'll give you that one i mean the pictures are it should have been washed but anyway it is what it is anyway this is neat i've got to give it something and because i haven't seen one of these for sale in a very long time i'm going to give this a 6 out of ten now we have an altezza but not really this is the lexus is-200 that i was talking about it's uh virtually identical to the other one uh cluster's a little bit different but

(Start: 00:05:08)
then you'll notice that the lump in the engine bay is vastly different this is a two liter straight six and uh it's a good motor don't get me wrong but they're two very different motors this one's got quite high mileage however it is a ridge and it is going for the exactly the same price so maybe what you could do is buy this car whilst the other dude falls badges i don't know you're gonna want the 3sg beams i personally think it's a little bit better than those plus it's proper jdm anyway that is the is-200 dash is different too a couple of subtle things i'm going to give this is 205 out of 10. oh now there's gonna be four supras coming up in a row yes four there's been four that came out in a week it's been absolutely crazy it's like someone decided to let the entire essay

(Start: 00:06:08)
super community know that they should sell their cars right now and that's what they've done this one however is uh not essay rage it's swaziland registered but it does have a decent amount of mods done to the car dude spend 400k on the car and will take 380k or the nearest cash offer 300 380 000 for the car uh looks like stock body when you look at missing headlights it's obviously a race car or just bought the car no headlights now the other thing i was going to say is perhaps the headlight was out because uh airflow but no it should have been that headlight if this is an rb26 or rb engine yes then that headlight it looks good it looks the part that is a massive turbo big intake polished intake custom top bullet intake i don't know sparkle harnesses it's proper right for okay a proper race car i mean roll cage and whatnot looks good with the 380 000 no se reg if

(Start: 00:07:11)
you want to thrash this thing around that's it um because the supra it's not necessary just kind of sucks i'm gonna give this a six out of ten too and then this bad boy the other supra that is essed yes this is acer ridge look at this that is like wow attention to detail wire tucked i mean color coding he's done so well and actually color coding everything i've been flipping out love it 680 000 so it's a lot of money but he's he's throwing the best of the best at it so he's got a whole tech elite he's got a boost control on it he's got a it's got a precision turbo on it he's got an m3 gearbox guessing that's a lot stronger than the one that comes on the supra anyway you guys can take a look at the

(Start: 00:08:12)
uh mod list and all that sort of stuff pause it essay ridge and uh it was value for a million round and you want 680 000. i don't know it is a lot of money i post this call my tick tock and a lot of the people on my tick tock got confused that i was selling this car you know offering me all sorts of [ __ ] like uh if you say african you all know green squeezy juice ross xbox ps2 and then a couple other people came on and they're like you're bloody stupid selling the car for this much you're not gonna get what you want for it so a lot of mixed feelings i like it i don't like the price super cool car would be cool to have i'm gonna give this car an eight and a half i don't usually do half marks but i'm gonna give it eight and a half out of ten and then this bad boy so i've he's come on the channel before in the last episode he had that silica with a 2j that old silica it was the sedeka supra

(Start: 00:09:14)
he's now selling his mark iv supra really really good looking car i don't know about these side skirts too much but still good looking man's got so many cars they're all stacked in here i don't know if you still got all of them uh that's a bit funky here i wonder what's going on there it says in the description gold tape everywhere just like my fd [Music] same strut too anyway 2j precision turbo aftermarket intercooler killer piping that's the same blower fell that i've got on my rx-7 [Music] beast anyway 5k cheaper than the other car a lot less mods s d 500 tax clearance or paper okay so this car was imported properly proper sa registered no funny business and i believe him i do mint

(Start: 00:10:16)
i got gonna give this one an eight out of ten oh then i found this thing okay first of all it's registered 2002 super i highly doubt 2002 and got abused it is very much a drift car a bit of rust wise fab angle kit massive wing rear rear bumpers like yeah drift car drift car needless to say it is still supra funky pixelized dash tachometer fake mama wheel still got that 2j got a smaller table in the other so this is probably not probably it will be a lot more responsive than others budget fuel pressure regulator cobra seats battery has been relocated it's a drift car so 35 82 one bar boosters through 420 wheel

(Start: 00:11:18)
horsepower so that is 315 kilowatts plus miners cars not been used in two months yeah look it's a drift car what more can you ask 250k i don't know if the price is right um i guess sir if you're gonna buy a 2j is it a build tj doesn't say let's just assume that it is plus the 350z gearbox you're already in for over a hundred grand just here on that so maybe it's worth it anyway because the super i gotta give this a 7 out of 10. oh then i found this okay unfortunately there's no price this is an fto there has been an fto that popped up before on the channel it was also in cape town i don't know what happened to it but the guy he didn't want a lot of money he wanted like 35k he knew the value of that car this one however doesn't he says it's one of 105 made up in the world uh well i don't know why

(Start: 00:12:24)
many mitsubishi ftos made okay he could be right here but 105 was slightly off so there were 112 made in 1998 of the gs model 37 of the gr i don't know anything about these ftos 102 of that one could be that i don't know um but anyway let's let's take a look so it has got that [Music] 2 liter v6 in it [Music] i don't know if this is a manual or if it's an auto is then interrupted there's none it doesn't say anyway so we're missing a bit of info he or she doesn't mind swapping a bit of a weird card kind of reminds me of an alpha on the back but the front reminds me of like a wannabe supra [Music] i don't know uh because i don't know much about this car

(Start: 00:13:24)
and i'm trying to figure out where the 105 came from so i mean there were a lot of these made they were 36 000 37 000 but definitely no 105 here i'm gonna give this add a four and a half out of ten then we have this fe powered rx-7 so it's got a two-liter fe engine t3t4 turbo it's got 5 speed it's got 286 kilowatts so it's pretty damn quick but it doesn't ever ride your ear and it's got a weird paint color to it but here's what it is the engine looks good big compressor housing small exhaust housing probably pretty responsive normal scene color wise number seen with the older style fb it's 5.5 and i've seen a lot of 0.5 coming up 5.5 out of 10. and then this is pretty damn unique this rav4

(Start: 00:14:25)
has got a 3s gte in it like somehow man's managed to shoehorn a 3s gte in here with some random i mean this was a front mount intercooler you can see it was a front mount and he just kind of like plonked it on top there and it seems to work i would love to give this thing a spin really unique not much more in phone here a lot of pictures for the rarity of this i mean anyone could do do you buy raffle pretty cheap and just do it yourself but because it's already been done i would have to go with a 6.5 out of 10. oh this is a mazda 323 now before you're like why the hell are you looking at old cars here wait for it this thing in a really nice garage i wish i could have a garage like that in the free state manual gauges what does that tell you it tells

(Start: 00:15:27)
you it's modified aftermarket reading [Music] fire extinguisher yeah it means something gets hot in there 3c3 diffuser exhaust aim down bag over there to protect it no engine by picture but if you scroll down it's got a 13b rotary inside and i'm assuming it's flipping fast can't really see anything but it's likely carb driven and i'm sure this is a beast absolute beast i would love to film this car i'd love to go for a in this car but it's a little bit far 120k i don't know i like there's a lot of pictures i don't like that there's no engine bay picture and i don't like that there's not a lot of info on the ad so i'm going to give this a 6 out of 10 but it is super rare and i love the car just from the side and this dude's got a silica

(Start: 00:16:27)
it's a st202 i think it's esse reg wallpaper's in auto so yeah it's got a two liter normally i spread it i spent a lot in my car i don't know well if it's still got to have 3s ge i don't think so [Music] all relative i guess like spending on a hyundai or spending on a gtr you can spend a lot on both but the amounts still vary quite a bit uh dude will swap for a subaru he didn't say what super so like an outback like a 96 outback for like very little money that's your swap there uh i don't know sd202 boring front wheel drive thing three and a half out of ten right then moving on to some that were on the facebook marketplace sent to me by a buddy of mine this is a honda crx turbo that want i don't know if it's sold but the guy wanted 350 000 round for it

(Start: 00:17:30)
it has every single spoon part you can think of honda accessory you name it it's got all the goodness i don't know much about honda so i'm really winging this thing it looks pretty awesome though that wing and what's done to the right heart and the wheels and the sides good i mean that's it's mint red seeds i don't know what steering while that is it's got diffie gauges that's a nice touch there's a difficult trailer as you can see no expense spared really really well done manifold turbocharged so this thing probably kicks ass that is a manual boost controller has come through into the cabin [Music] uh power honda i mean this thing will probably munch all of my cars here it is ah cyborg flag angela headlocks hon integra type r engine with the following mods so

(Start: 00:18:31)
it's fully forged damn dude turbo smart stuff megan racing cylinder box mods ecu skunk 2. for some reason i thought it had spoon stuff or was it because i watched foster fierce recently anyway this dude zakolin is selling the car it's done really well 350k i don't know i'm not even going to comment on the price i don't know if it's worth it but uh that is that one and i'm gonna give that because it looks amazing and i know absolutely nothing about honda's unless it's an nsx i'm going to give that a 7 out of 10. and we come up to our final car there is a honda crx dell soul guys wanting 120 it i don't know if it's still available i don't know if the ad is still on this was sent to me about two weeks ago it is a turbo so it's going to be 20 turbo in it

(Start: 00:19:34)
it's fully forged or partially forged well that's cool he's got the roof and everything for it this chorus somewhere in south africa those look like gp plates a joburg ultra rare if you can get your hands on this super rare i know they're all over the place in america but yeah they're rare darby olivier family man cool car really rare running on 0.5 bar bluestone how much power does it make because it's really going to give us a seven again a seven out of ten i think that's what i gave the last car that is it for the video though those are all the cars that i could find during the month of october and i made this video a little bit late so we just got into november now uh but if you guys find cars i don't have a facebook account i don't want facebook uh but if you find cars on facebook that you think are interesting and could make it into the video please send them through to me on my instagram or

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to the vlog i'm going to be working on the rx-7 fd 3s we're going to be doing a whole lot of stuff getting through as much as we can tonight i'm going to say we it's just me but you guys are watching so you're keeping me company does that make sense no not really but i'm going to be working on the car i'm going to be uh attempting to get this turbo out and well i'm actually going to make a list of stuff to do on my whiteboard here what i'm going to be doing on the fd oh i got my list i'm going to get cracking i'm gonna pull out this intercooler somebody said pull everything out but it'll go back in it'll go back in better a lot of this [ __ ] doesn't have clamps on oh hang on i've got an idea [Applause] there we go

(Start: 00:01:10)
let's see if i can but i want to take out this insecure and the brackets together yes these brackets are so sick if you guys are ogs here i have these made up by russell from rustic race engineer he actually did it for me because he felt bad because my existing brackets were so shitty i didn't ask him for it that's how cool dude he is there we go i'm gonna take this radiator out man i'm gonna lose some water so what i want to do is i want to fold

(Start: 00:02:12)
it this way and then i want to get out the shroud so i can fit in that replacement fan that i got you know always when the coolest of [ __ ] happens battery data to put on charge quickly going to film this i got the radiator out this was that dodgy electric fan that i set up this was going to get controlled by relay on a switch because the other one blew but then i'll end up buying a full radiator set from the uk with fans and blah blah so i'm going to throw a stock fan back in here now this thing is going to come out anyway this was so easy i forgot how easy it was i ended my mounts and then i just pulled on the radiator pulled it up three screws boom shroud is out now i'm gonna cut the wiring probably pull it back into the cabin maybe i don't know maybe i'll leave it there it could be a good use for something else tape it up just finish this guy but i realized there's a flipping problem here this is too short i remember modifying this months ago actually probably about

(Start: 00:03:14)
a year ago extended that see the issue is the plugs down here and the radiator shroud sits down here and well i can't bring it over i need to bring it around so i need to extend that i'll do that later plenty other [ __ ] today i'm playing a little bit of adhd kit here because i got the v-band off so exhaust hanging loose and this is supported at the bottom uh oil feed is now off and then i moved across to the whole city adhd kit i've never clocked the turbo before and i just figured out how easy it is to do can i do this with one hand maybe yeah see that look how easy that is so what i've done is there's a v-band over here loosen the v-band and then there's four bolts over here just ever so slightly loosen them honestly i was shooting myself i was watching a couple of videos in wholesale two i think newer ones there was like a

(Start: 00:04:14)
circle up here and you'd have to use a circlip uh that thing so clip pliers so i was a little bit nervous if that was the case and this one doesn't have that there's no circlip thing on the inside i'm so stoked so that's out of the way kind of i'm probably going to leave it loose jesus looks like somebody punched me in the eye this car always makes me so dirty compared to my others uh yeah connor paul that's the old turbo i think she's a mess [ __ ] i need to get [ __ ] done here um i am struggling here like a [ __ ] so those studs i've been able to get that one the back one and the back corner out this one over here you just can't flip and get to basically it's touching the manifold over there and i can't get a socket around it i had

(Start: 00:05:15)
this issue before when it was when it was out of the car and this is why we myself gareth jono and somebody else i think the two giants we put the manifold in with the turbo i can't do that right now because of covert i'm not meeting up with any people i'm i'm stuck i'm doing this on my own the only thing i can think of right now is to set up my chain block like above the car hold up the manifold while i undo the the bolts on the side and then yeah i don't know i don't know what else to do i thought maybe taking the compressor housing off the turbo i'd be able to have a little bit more space yes i do but i'll just yeah manifold's in the way damn it so close because i think honestly think that would fit on easier than that turbo maybe wrong it's like 10

(Start: 00:06:17)
pm now i managed to get this one out in the front but then i don't know what the hell i was thinking i forgot about the one in the back so that's out that one's out that one's out turbo is loose i can't get to that [ __ ] i'm gonna end the video here but maybe someone's got a little bit of advice for me i can't get to it from the bottom because the manifold's in the way i can't really fit any tools here so i know how we did it we took everything out obviously and we put everything back in with the manifold and turbo when i was out on the bench we could get a spanner in there to tighten this actually just a bolt that's going in from the top down so it's not a stud like the others question is how [ __ ] do i get to [ __ ] anyway at least there's been some flipping progress on the car um if anyone has any ideas i'm going to be back in the garage again pretty soon i'm going to end the video here leave it at that next time i'm in i want to get that server out and i want to put the big one in it's got to happen someone let me know in the comment section thanks so much for the support see you all next one peace

Title: Japanese Car Auctions : Top Picks of October 2020 - Skyline R32 GT-R V SPEC II and MORE!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN9LjH9Y54

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to a brand new video today's video is going to be all of the coolest japanese cars that sold at the auctions in october 2020. so going straight into these cars are not in any particular order it's just what i thought were my personal bests for the month of october 2020. looking at a mitsubishi evo 3 it sold for 7 600 us dollars in 1995 super high mileage now i don't pick the best of the best cars all the time i do and i've got some gems here but i also look at the the bottom end those that people can generally afford most people can afford 325 000 kilometers on a 4g 63 that's pretty damn good going i don't know if it's been open there's not a lot of information here so we don't know if the engine has been touched there are however a whole lot of picks and the cost seems good it's a it's an e-exterior which means there's a lot of issues and it's a d interior but we're not so good as in a project

(Start: 00:01:03)
car for the price and everything else i mean the bumpers are a whole lot irrational it's it's definitely one of these cars that you'd want to pick up and just screw around with it wouldn't it wouldn't be a full restoration look at the carpet steering wheel's a bit screwed this gauge is horrific that's like a an 80 ml gauge i think it's the hk sketch too anyway seat bolsters stuffed i'm not going to spend a lot of time on this because i have a lot of cars coming up and uh well here's all the issues wow a lot of stuff gone wrong lots of big dents lots of scratches let's move on from this one but it is one of my picks on the low end for project car evo 3 cool car and then no order whatsoever so i don't bore you guys with a bunch of evos

(Start: 00:02:05)
here's a mitsubishi gto 9 model so it's like last generation sold for almost 12 000 us dollars got semi medium to high mileage 130 000 kilometers and it's been rebuilt well the body's been okay here we go so the xx those are rebuilt panels either resprayed or replaced panels i doubt the roof has been replaced so re-sprayed panels it looks to be in stock stock form i mean if you look at the the wheels the wheels the wheels look stuck the exhausts look stuck this is a manual and it's got an r grading like i mentioned c d so c exterior which means it's just average d interior meaning not grand it's still a cool car it's a stock example unfortunately not the pop-up version but i kind of

(Start: 00:03:06)
like it either way then we have the king of pop-ups questionably the king of pop-ups sold for 42 429 us dollars it is the only honda nsx that's sold month of october the only one usually i'll see about seven to ten this is the only one it's fully automatic which sucks a lot of them are it's really hard to come by a manual at the auctions these days i haven't seen one in months but it is what it is it got a high rating it got a four five being a brand new car so four is damn good you should look past the order just look past the leather interior as most are it looks clean bit away on that dude's been sitting there idling relaxing while he's driving his little auto nsx greasing up that gear stick lever whatever you want to call it regardless

(Start: 00:04:11)
cool caster fifteen thousand four hundred us dollars for a str version five 1999 model 250 000 kilometers high myla e degrading rebuilt something's been rebuilt it looks like the bonnet's been rebuilt or re-sprayed it's a two-door which i mean people are snapping these up because they're the cooler two doors and the gc8 is the only variant that we we had in subaru's that were in princes there were two door and this is a stock example it's got the stock wheel it's got stock fogs in the front it's got a modified exhaust and not that stock i probably should have looked at the pick in the rear before i said anything but this is mostly stock with a momo wheel with a bunch of cages and uh probably a turbo time this is like an apexi turbo timer so it's not that stuck it's got the

(Start: 00:05:13)
water intercooler spray it's got dccd oh man i want one [Music] yeah that is an apexi turbo timer and then tuned by sti sticker on the coin holder ashtray thing defi gauges d5 gauges whatever you want to call it i don't know for 15 grand they're all going for close to this price this is like medium of the range it was a one that was a lot more expensive but 15 000 us dollars 250 000 around i mean kilometers a lot of money here this is the b spec too there's only two picks it's been repaired somewhere through the rear of the car the boot trunk and the spoiler repaired or replaced cc so it's just average average good looking car v-spec 2 it's got 140

(Start: 00:06:13)
000 kilometers it's got an exhaust on it and it sold for almost a hundred thousand us dollars that is 1.6 million round plus minus and that is before 25 duties that is before 15 vote that is before shipping export charges shaken fee on their side the radiation check when it gets your weight bridge see blah blah blah yes i'm gonna make a video on this because i've been getting bombarded by all the new people joining the channel please make a video on how to import a car i'm working on it i will get out something soon um these are a lot easier for me to make uh just sit down and talk the other ones are mostly scripted and they have to be 100 on point so i am working on something give me some time busy life at the moment with the kids and whatnot try my best 34 beautiful

(Start: 00:07:13)
mr2 gts this is the turbocharged variant i just wanted to show you guys this how cheap they are and the the price for an average one goes for about four and a half thousand us dollars for a turbocharged model one like mine which is a gt limited or just a g sad they go for like 500 us dollars for a really bust one to about a thousand five hundred us dollars yeah but you don't say africa because we can't get them they are they're not collectors items they're not on the collect designs at least you have to bring one in as a returning resident so go work overseas for 12 months bring whatever car back because on this right-hand drive there's that and that's what makes the car so much more expensive here so if i sell mine i'll probably get like 75 maybe up to 85k max

(Start: 00:08:13)
but you buy them they're 500 us dollars anyway 3 000 us dollars this is the turbocharged variant this is the one with the 3s gte engine and an exterior you can see why it's a three grading so it's average d interior the exterior there's a lot of paint fade on the bonnet clear coat rather it's got the mr2 stickers on the side tane sticker i don't know why it doesn't look like there's any drop whatsoever these are the stock wheels i don't think he's got any coilovers or springs whatnot he's got stock exhaust system and that's the bonner that comes with the turbocharged variant so you know that is the real deal that is server charge variant there's a few small issues small dents and things and paint defects and whatnot but for the price i mean yeah you're winning you're winning mitsubishi evo five

(Start: 00:09:15)
sold for nine and a half thousand us dollars the 1998 model 200 000 kilometers on it it's a three so again average dc let's take a look at the exterior here i mean just look at the pictures it doesn't look all that bad you can see some clear coat damage on the roof exhaust has got one of those funny little silencer things really silly momo wheel probably a boost controller i think that that is the best control i think that's a pivot or an ultra boost controller and then that is a turbo timer i think mobile wheel and then it's got a screen there i don't know what the screen's for what's that now maybe oh average 10k it gets you a decent amount of castle

(Start: 00:10:19)
this is a stock specs this isn't a v-spec this is just an r34 gtr it's all for 86 000 us dollars again a lot of money like 1.35 1.4 million round my math serves me right the grading is better than the other one however there's a 4cb so the interior is spotless almost being a b a is brand new so b is damn good i mean you can see straight away off that picture very very very nice that's a lot of money you know back in the day when i bought my my 32 which was 2013 i was hunting i had the option to get one of these for like 350 for not a bust one but like one that's a little bit worse than us 350 000 round 47 that's like probably 20 000 less listener

(Start: 00:11:21)
yeah yeah and then i decided on a 32 because i thought i would be able to get everything i didn't have kids at the time and you know life is expensive now i'm feeding for two oh yes this thing is so sick eighteen thousand u.s dollars 972 so early early on uh it's got a thousand kilometers apparently or allegedly a thousand kilometers into manual and it's got a zero grading don't know why and it's bc so the exterior is just like mint and then interior the interior is greater than c but it's not always graded on if it's bad it's also great on the mods and and that sort of stuff so it's this does not look like a c this is like borderline a diffie gauges defi controller guessing

(Start: 00:12:22)
that's a boost controller i don't recognize the four buttons another deffi gauge i wonder what gauge that is that's probably boost and then it's all the usuals water temp and all that oil temp nice seats this thing is so sick i don't know i think that's a master speed bumper someone correct me it's got skirts it's got was that a rocket bunny not comfy someone told me someone someone all know 18k this is bad mileage okay so it's not a thousand i don't know what the mileage is they probably change the cluster nope i don't know moving on ah sexy v-spec 2 r32 gtr this is the last of the last gtrs it sold for 48 000 us dollars that's hot exactly half the price of

(Start: 00:13:24)
that expensive 34. it's a full grading cd so interior is not great but we don't have interior pictures it's likely stock okay it's got t-37s on it okay that's see i should just look at pictures before i talk it's definitely got a drop this is definitely sitting on coilovers i don't know what coilovers and it's going to the no you kill you absolutely kill the look on a v-spec 2 bra anyway the starting price was 30 000 us dollars and it shot up to 48 and it sold for 48 and i wonder where this car is going probably the states it's got hks goodies on our t37s so hot 74 000 so it's low milo what is mine mine's got 87 87 000

(Start: 00:14:24)
kilometers of marco this one sold for 8400 i just wanted to show you this because the prices have gone up decently especially that this one is potentially non-running so this means that there's no inspection done to the car and it doesn't tell you anything else you buy it basically start unseen unknown rather unknown history tells you the mileage and that's it it doesn't tell you so you take a real gamble it's sitting in a lot outside the auction house so it doesn't go into the auction house and you don't know you could be buying something with no engine scary anyway i want to show you how bad it is with the pricing on how the pricing went up for a car that you don't know anything about so mine is a 1997 type rs exactly like this exactly

(Start: 00:15:26)
the same spec have the same wheels okay i move these wheels across the black car i'll never have that wing though and i've got everything identical mine was even stock same as this i had stock exhausts in the works looks like there's an issue at the door and that's uh and um eight thousand four hundred us dollars for something you don't even know if it works or not and you already know that there's something wrong one the door's not closing that's the same wheel i had my car pulled it out someone's put an led here for what reason who knows i'm gonna give it a solid guess and i'm gonna say this led this long cable running to the ecu and it's got the diagnostic mode thing maybe uh there's that and then it's missing the radio and then there's some smelly stuff there and then that i don't know what it is but that's a lot of money for something

(Start: 00:16:28)
that you don't know if it works or even as an engine pulsar gtir that's the four wheel drive version it is a 93 it's all for nine and a half thousand us dollars three and a half grading just above average d for both interior and exterior and you can see why mean looking little bugger i mean i'm okay it's a baby gtr i'd be hellevin flippin what is the word for this i mean i'd be a hell of a nervous to like have this thing pop up in my rear view mirror my race wheel gauge stripped out carpets roll cage missing event crappy carpet

(Start: 00:17:28)
don't know what seats in the front they're the red one but it's pretty much wrecked in terms of like it's race car this is a race car strut brace in the back completely stripped out at least the roll cage is not welded in they've made it with yeah i mean they're probably drilled and did all that anyway moving on from the pulsar to a very rare at least for me i've never seen one in real life mazda81 12 000 us dollars for this little thing that's such a cool little card 660 cc is turbocharged and uh this one's been repaired or rebuilt somewhere bonnet front-end fenders bonnet other fender bd so b exterior really good exterior so that means it's been re-sprayed repaired etc d interior so it's probably neat ish but it's got

(Start: 00:18:29)
all this crap in it i mean that's a disgusting momo feel that looks like a tachometer and then those are gritty white face ah gritty white face have a look at this this is you know usually you have over here you've got sliders for air conditioning and all that it's over here cool here's the engine bay so it's got some silicon pop work and i don't know if the intercooler's been modified i'm not too familiar with the engine bay it does have a blitz blower valve in it then we've got this chaser what chaser adam c would go bonkers for this thing it's a tour of trd sports it's got the trd bumpers and all that sort of stuff 20 000 us dollars a lot of money for this especially that it's got 2200 000 kilometers on it 1998 model above average everything's just average above average

(Start: 00:19:32)
good looking car i mean it's kind of like giving me skyline vibes i just block off the rear door skyline vibe come on especially those side side mirrors there um so it's it's on coilovers the doors don't look like they're closing properly the rear bumper is off color and it's got a modified exhaust it is sick i love this thing i would totally get this if i fix it up and probably daily this thing jzx100 so cool and the last of the last this was the cheapest r32 gtr that sold in october 2020. the there was one that went under negotiation but it didn't sell and it stopped at 17 000 u.s dollars didn't sell it didn't hit the reserve so we don't know this one did sell confirmed sell 19.5 000 us dollars gets you a 1989 model with 170 000

(Start: 00:20:32)
kilometers it's a rebuild repaired it's a fender yeah probably re-spread and then rdc [Music] yeah it's it's a locker it's got stock wheels it's got the v-spec bumpers and their bumper same as mine whatever you want to call it and then that is not the stock exhaust and it's sitting on stock suspension tell you that much stock seats does look like it has a modified wheel uh but yeah you can just see how much the processors have gone up by it's unbelievable i should actually probably do a compress comparison i've got processing of of archive stuff from like 2015 2016 maybe up until now and of all kind of things and maybe i should just do a video one day where i compare process of jdm cars then now but yeah for the most part this is the cheapest r32 gtr that sold

(Start: 00:21:34)
at the auctions in october 2020. add all your fees and you get the the landed price in south africa and it's it's pretty expensive for what it is that being said that is the final call for the night thank you so much for watching really appreciate it i will see you in the next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it all these opinions and all these positions they come in in millions they're blocking your vision but no you can't listen that is all fiction cause you hold the power as long as you're dreaming

Title: RX7 FD3S Get's some new parts!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGnlYIwA2Kc

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] what's up guys and welcome back to the vlog i'm super excited today because i picked up something awesome for the rx-7 fd 3s i've decided that it's now hard time that i'll spend some time on it's been sitting in that corner for probably about two months now i'm not gonna lie i have flooded it again i need to put it back on stands and that was my own fault before the comment critics come on and tell me that there's something wrong it was my own fault i started the car up for like i don't know 45 seconds and then i had my wife screaming at the window there was an emergency with the baby inside switch the coal the car flooded so i need to take out the plugs replace the plugs again clean them do whatever and then get the car running um but we need to get the gtr first out of the garage because i need a little bit of a cleanup and show you guys the new toy

(Start: 00:01:20)
but i need to fix a couple things first before we do so that's what i'm going to do quickly today is i want to close up all this crap and i want to sort out this blue scale this blue sketch popped like a couple weeks ago it's completely dead i can't get any power to it at all so i'll put up on my tik tok what i should do as two gauges and here's the response that i did yet i've got this grady boost gauge here and i've got blitz cruise gauge so what i was thinking was either i put the the grady like up here or over there and then put a wide band in here because i do need to get the white balance or i put this blood smooth sketch over here and i put the y band at the top i'm thinking i'm going to go for the wire bail up top it's probably more important for me to see how far is i'll feel it if the boost is is higher or lower and then i can obviously look down plus that also shows me boost so i think having wideband up top where

(Start: 00:02:21)
it's more visible but somewhere over there this is my life that'll probably be beneficial so we're going to quickly swap this out clean up this mess tied everything up pack it back under and then here's my switch for the fan you can have that and i've got something new now all you purists don't hate me because it is a wrap but it's a cool rift there it is picked up a bumper for the fd so this is like a knuckle feed bumper like a version two it's very similar or maybe somebody that comments actually knows what this is let me know i think it's a version too similar to that uh and some pretty blessed decent like it's had a little bit of filler done and whatnot but other than that it looks good inside looks like canada's father does

(Start: 00:03:22)
i'm pretty happy that i picked it up for a good deal you're probably wondering what i'm going to be doing about the lights because the headlights on sorry the indicator lights are different on this bumper to my original one um i've actually ordered a bunch from japan and when i say bunches i got one complete set and um so that one's cool that one's gonna be coming soon then i picked up a bunch of cheapies one of the crack which was right inside small crack one with some scratches also right inside and it was a a what was it it was a stock one so it was like a silver top creamy look and then picked up a left hand side hyper sport which was full clear i'll probably never find the right hand side one but it was so cheap i figured let me just pick up those and uh they'll be a pretty soon and then i'm gonna crack it with the bumper i'm gonna obviously have to do a little bit of work with regards to sanding and fitment and all that but i'm prepared for that i want to get this gtr out of the garage now and i want to start working on the rx-7 now

(Start: 00:04:24)
[Music] this bad boy needs to go i've also decided that the boost control that's in the afd at the moment is the older spec hk cec and since i've got so many of these lying around with displays i'm going to standardize and do what i've got in that car and keep everything the same but obviously for our hospital here and then one of these days get cracking on that for now i'm going to turn up the garage it's in a state and tighten up the wiring gear out of this car for the fbi inside the euro so here we got the old gauge out kinda maybe you had to bash it a little bit just to get out of there and then here's the boost sensor this is the digital one obviously i'm running it on analog now mechanical so i have to feed this guy through here so if you want to know how to do this the easiest way lock your wheel undo one screw over here right there and then

(Start: 00:05:27)
feed the pump through the top or any wires feed it through the top make sure you get it dangling over here then all you're going to do there's a grommet which i'm going to show you it's a little bit too damn dark in there there's a grommet down there with some electrical stuff that goes in what i did is i took metal coating which is hard to come by these days i found a pack of thirty i just i quickly bought them tie the other end to the coat hanger push it through make sure you get on that end then just start feeding it that's it i mean that took me like 10 minutes [Music] alrighty i am done all my wiring is tidied up and i got my beautiful blitz boost gauge in here mechanicals are nice and fast [Music] right that was a fail uh this piece of red flippin thing i actually haven't used it on any of the cars before um it collapsed in the pressure so it was like sitting like this every time i wanted to um

(Start: 00:06:30)
every time i switched on the car it was just collapsing so i redid the whole  again i thought that red hose that was in there was actually crimping because it was slightly thinner but it turns out it wasn't the mechanical boost gauge this blitz one went for a ball of it's completely dead i guess that's uh what you get with all japanese mechanical parts that one came out of the black rx-7fd it was working in the car i don't know it's probably just been sitting for too long out in the open and it's completely screwed i'm still going to stick to my original plan i'm going to put a boost gauge at the bottom and the wide band at the top i've already done all the ground work and i've run the boost hose into the cabin so i'm going to throw in a mechanical gauge again i've got a couple coming from japan that should be here in about a month or so what i'm going to do is i'm going to wait for those to arrive

(Start: 00:07:31)
and i'll just throw this thing in as a placeholder but i don't want to bore you guys with this video i'm going to stop working on the fd now it's flooded you guys have seen a million flood d flood videos i'm going gonna put it up on stands and um change the plugs get into the garage and then we'll start a new vlog from there a little bit bleak about this whole thing but what can you do i was hoping the video could go in a different direction anyway uh thank you for all the new subscribers we've got close to 300 new subscribers in the last 28 days which is fantastic there is quite a bit of content coming up very soon so stay tuned make sure you hit that bell notification just to keep up to date with everything thank you so much for watching i'll see you on the next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be a pro don't waste your time no more who the are you to tell me what to do i don't give a

(Start: 00:08:32)
damn if you say you disapprove i'm gonna make my move i'm gonna make it soon and i'll do it cause it's what i wanna  do cause all these opinions and all these positions they come in in millions they blocking your vision but no you can't listen that is all fiction cause you hold the power as long as you're dreaming

Title: JDM Cars For Sale in South Africa - 300zx Project Car | Import WRX | Celica's and more!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9PUXeIG_PQ

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to jdm cars for sale this is season two episode five and welcome to the 167 brand new subscribers that have joined me over the last few days now for all of you that are new here i'm going to be taking a look at cars for sale on gumtree olex junk mail et cetera et cetera wherever i can find the costs for sell and i'm gonna give them a quick review read about them and then kind of tell you what what i think about them out of like a rating of 10 or so that's what we generally do here and this is what we're about to jump right into right now so starting off with this first one it's um actually stripping for sprayers but i was hoping it'd still be complete and someone could maybe buy it resurrected i don't know i don't know if it doesn't if it's not licensed whatnot but it's a 300zx it's a 1995 model so it's a later model i mean it looks like everything's still there it's probably not so rich there's no licenses on here there's no plates who knows it's got wheels and stuff i mean this dude looks like some sort of a salvage yard

(Start: 00:01:00)
breaker i don't know what that thing is i think it could be a chev i don't know maybe someone told me in the comment section but um i thought i thought i'd bring this up it's got a some interesting pieces on it that's the one i'm not going to rate this i just thought i'd get this out of the way quickly and we're going to move on to one of the real cars so this 200 esx looks like it had quite a bit done too this is the engine was completely overhauled it's still got stock internals and there's quite a few random things like bigger fuel pump it's got a new turbo on it it's got a front mount intercooler dude's got six by nines um it looks decent i don't know the price for one of these is a little bit high especially [Music] i don't know i was gonna say especially since there's so many around and you'll generally find these cars they go for about i mean i was finding a couple on friends were saying to me from facebook marketplace now coming in at like 35 for

(Start: 00:02:02)
a railing chassis or actually like 30k for royal chassis about 50k for something running but like full of problems negotiable even there was a baby blue on it went for 36k i showed you guys in the last video the baby blue one that one's gone sold for 36. that's cheap 100k i understand there's a lot done to the car and i like that you've put a lot of effort into the post selling because i'm relocating overseas very reluctant sale unfortunately he's gonna have to do it i mean it looks good um i'm not so sure about the wheels and the wing but again it's personal preference it matches the so it matches the cr18 det that's in the car it looks like there's quite a bit of stuff done to it so i mean i've got to give you that out of 10 i would rate this car a 7 because the ad is good the car is good there's a lot of stuff done to it i don't know i'll change a couple of things the wheels come off and moving right on away from the trinity sx's let's look at the subaru svx

(Start: 00:03:03)
i i'm getting a little bit confused here i'm not sure if this was in the previous video i forgot to actually just fact check but uh this is an svx it is a 3.3 liter [Music] h6 so it's got a beast of an engine a lot of people take these engines out and they they fit them into gc8 models and and other subaru's where they can fit or throw them into um what is that big one it is a legacy it's a legacy b4 it's cool but i mean i wouldn't bastardize this one because it's got stock wheels and all sorts of stuff and you'll generally find this car to be left hand drive this however is the japanese variant very very neat interior i have pinged this guy before he didn't respond to me i'm waiting for feedback and it's an automatic but so be it this would be a collector's item in my eyes very cool i wonder how much you want to sell this car for if you're watching this or know him i'd love to know

(Start: 00:04:04)
i need to be honest with you dudes this car i withheld from the previous video so the previous one of season 2 episode 4 couple weeks ago i would tell because i thought i was going to buy this car so i filmed it on the day this car came out and well i honestly thought i was going to give the guy a call and and take it he wants 47 000 round which is next to nothing there there's an issue with it one it's an n a two there's a lot of rust damage it's surface rust so this stuff will just come off quickly with an angle grinder and i don't think there's anything that you need to cut and weld from what i see it's got a few issues so there's a lot of detailing work that you need to do and spraying and whatnot bumper's broken in the front it gets a little bit worse and i think it's too much of a project call for me it does have the big three liter v6 however it is normally aspirated not twin turbo and that is really unfortunate [Music] it is missing a window passenger window

(Start: 00:05:06)
is missing the engine's still okay starting go minimal sun damage to leather interior never mind the sun damage your seats are completely ruined let's drop by the picture of the seats here look at that okay there's the water box did i mention i had an order it's an order it's also swayed me away uh door cards broken door cars are completely screwed like somebody ripped it or what dog got in here i don't know seat stuffed like i said who cares about the flippin sun damage uh carpet's gone or at least the removable carpet's gone steering wheel is this car is bad and i'll see it still for sale i mean if you want a 300 zx and you just want to guts it and do like something like calvin marley one of the big youtubers and he's had the maroon one with the 2j and now it's white this would be the car to start with not for me i'm going to give this because of the conditioning because it's an order and missing a window and seats and then and and

(Start: 00:06:08)
[Music] i'm going to give it a 4 out of 10. i'll buy if it was like 30k but it's not so 4 out of 10. this fd3s came up for sale two nights ago i'll save the post in case someone snapped it up but uh it's for sale there's no engine inside it is a 95 92 it's a 92 and it looks like a monster truck look at that that's classic so there's uh there's likely no gearbox in here either there's no exhaust obviously that's a different shade of red unless my eyes are playing me a weird carbon skin type thing yeah there's no gearbox look there anyway man's got stock seats missing the carpets again that weird i don't know what it is [Music] it could be like a wrap or something

(Start: 00:07:08)
hopefully it's a wrap battery is relocated to the boot the carpet like lifts over here so i've done exactly the same relocation my battery box sits in exactly the same spot [Music] except my ground is the other way around so my power runs through here and it comes out the back and it pops out through this little this little hole between the back seat and the carpet and it comes over the carpet and then i made a hole in the side of the box and comes through into the box and then my ground comes on this way and i'm grounding up here and i'm grounding down there and i'm grounding someone else and grinding back to the front a lot neater than just cutting up your damn carpet but 125k is quite a bit of change for a car that doesn't have an engine or a gearbox it is sa rage he wasn't a software 2j if you look at his post he actually has a 2j for sale for 30k

(Start: 00:08:10)
go hit him up but i mean for me i paid a lot less than this for my running black fd but that was imported from japan and it is automatic my black fd is automatic but it has a rotary engine twin turbo stock and it runs and also quite a bit cheaper than not anymore though prices have gone up so i gotta give it a five and a half out of ten if you want to build an fd and you don't want to pay the 250k that they're all selling for right now um get this car throw your own engine in now you've got a if fd for like a reasonable amount then we've got another rx-7 this one is an fb pictures the sideways unfortunately uh actually there we go now this car looks like it's missing a few things there's door handles that are missing

(Start: 00:09:12)
i'm not sure if the trim is missing here if the windscreen is missing uh let's see incomplete needs a front windscreen and other small bits it was 45k negotiable which is pretty damn cheap and it's got bbs wheels on i don't know if they're real fake but i don't know man it's i wouldn't mind this car i just i wonder if we could put an rb20 [Music] i was i was contemplating not putting this car on the video because i thought maybe you know just maybe but no um so if you do to now pick up a cheap rx-7 this is the one he'll probably take 40k i don't know it says negotiable i'll probably label a little bit more but that's me um i mean it looks good it looks good so i gotta give this let's call it a six out of ten my rating [Music] another rx-7 this one in cape town

(Start: 00:10:13)
for a lot of money 135 000 and 1983 and the ad is in afrikaans for 66 mil turbo it makes 280 kilowatts uh on 0.5 bar and it is bridgeport it's a british ported engine 19 18 years ago i was in school and that was the last time i died for cons everything is up to date papers and license and it's got an electronic [Music] i don't know what that is it's got an electronic something and all the work is in the car contact him on something something a lot of money but it looks like a lot of car and there's something in the background there ah there's another rx-7 [Music] i don't know i don't know what that is

(Start: 00:11:14)
some random car what if this is a workshop probably a workshop yep anyway it looks nice was it an engine bay picture there is an engine bay picture okay so it's a 13b two router big ass turbo no filter [Music] i was in a sense of v-mount intercutor but it's like more like a front setup and i wonder what the turbo's sucking in just hot air [Music] making good power though 280 kilowatts at 0.5 bar that's that's pretty damn decent so i got to give you [Music] a solid six and a half out of 10. i was gonna say seven six and a half because i don't like the price that's me [Music] boom 2jz supra this dude

(Start: 00:12:16)
i've wore he's been selling cars left right in the center this is not the first car that i featured on channel that he's sold he wants a 100k this is an old zubra and it's got a 2j in it and it's got a gte non-vvti which is impressive the mark ii super silica he's got busy coilovers on the car he's got bucket seats got a ecu start and go no issues perfect drifter race car for japanese enthusiasts damn straight cool car i like it it's even got a little takata toe strap thing [Music] there's the beast 2j big single taper nice blanket fpr in the back uh i mean i don't know much about this car technically it's got a box a ball ball and a turbo that's all i know yeah adjustable shoe pressure regulator

(Start: 00:13:18)
i don't know what injectors i don't know anything else but it looks like a beast and it's got coilovers it's got bucket seats and a hell of a fuel setup this is a really decent fuel setup swell pot pumps nice nice kit very very nice kit two pumps filters probably worth the money i've got to give this this is probably the most unique car on for possibly tonight i just gotta check out the rest i actually forgot now but i gotta give this one an eight out of ten good price as well this one is nearby this is 30 kilometers away from me in queensborough i think greens are 30 kilometers 40 000 round 92 it is so this would be an st 182 i had the st 185 collis saints limited edition the only one in africa which i sold for i don't even remember thirty something thousand round almost forty thousand

(Start: 00:14:19)
round accommodated a solid one of five thousand [Music] kicked myself every day it was also red in color like this and uh this will be an n a it will have either a 3s ge or 3 s fe or a 5 sfp [Music] i don't know much about the n a ones i just thought i'd throw it up and i actually didn't even bother reading it's only because i have do you know the fun skill or time to give it the attention [Music] okay so is it negotiable [Music] ah 3sfe which is a camry engine okay so this is actually because with 80 if it is in good condition not really if it was in japan it would be worth like 500 but yeah i think what you're asking is okay like just okay um 80 grand you

(Start: 00:15:21)
yeah you should get a you get one with a 3s gte in it not this thing this is this is front wheel drive if i remember correctly i got a fact check fd182 silica ah see same color red and even top and red uh rear wheel drive pretty short front wheel drive hi in august 1985 the cause layout was changed from front wheel drive to from rear wheel drive to front wheel drive and all-wheel drive for turbocharged models okay that's right so your front wheel drive who wants a front wheel drive non-turbo japanese car not me don't get me wrong it does remind me of my red one and i miss it every day

(Start: 00:16:21)
that being said i've got to give you i just was let's say 4 but it reminds me of my old one so i'll give you a 5 out of 10. another silica really poor small pictures looks like it's been screenshotted but also okay that was non-jdm my skin's burning [Music] okay back to the jdm um also an st182 and this is she wants 40 what a mess she wants 80 000 rand for the silica and there's no specs he's selling half of his collection because he has too many vehicles [Music]

(Start: 00:17:21)
um okay i had water engines in here like why are you asking for 80 000 and the other dudes probably based his price on this guy's price i understand that you have a crazy splitter in the front so when you like go over 180k the car kind of like does this and flips over and runs on this roof um yeah poor pictures i don't know what it what's in the car it's you're asking a lot of money for something that i don't know and uh you can have a three out of ten [Music] goodbye this i brought this up in the last video uh he's put in new pictures so occasionally i will bring cars in that we've already had on the channel and this is one of those cars however man says urgent sale in capitals and he changed some of the pictures so this car is

(Start: 00:18:22)
called seven kilometers away from me maybe less [Music] and we spoke about this horrific steering wheel uh we spoke that it was an import and not a local one and he's pretty important the title so i'm wondering if he's watching i'd love to buy this car from you however i'm not prepared to pay 65k free for your car um but if you're watching hit me up on instagram we'll tick tock at one tick knock now um yeah it's a reg soft spot for these again i had so many just thought i'd bring it up maybe someone else wants to give it a good loving home maybe offer him a little bit less [Music]

(Start: 00:20:04)
[Music] moving on to our final three cars now these are from a website that i don't use very often don't take my word for it actually any of these cars that you see on here please don't take my word for them um i don't know if they're scams or whatnot so anyway this website is called travert cars and i have seen quite a few scams on here before um i don't know if these are legit but anyway there's a turning sx selling for 62 000 rounds got a really crappy picture on it and um i just thought i'd bring that up i'm not even going to get it racing because of the picture then particularly what i wanted to talk

(Start: 00:21:06)
about was this mr2 this is super interesting low quality picture kind of it is a soft top so this is i don't i don't know if they're actually sw20s but it's got this cool thing at the back that some of the turbo models had and it's got the new age mr2 wheels in it um guy wants a lot of money for it he wants 160 000 rand for it and it looks like it might be at a dealer surf for cars i don't know it's a lot of money but it really is unique um assuming that in the back is a 3s ge just like mine um but i might may may not be wrong i don't know i thought i'd bring this up uh because it's unique i would have to give it a 6 out of ten [Music] and then the last one i don't know if this is a scam or not again um low quality pictures they've taken

(Start: 00:22:07)
out the number plate they want eighteen thousand we never got these cars in south africa um got what's 18 000 for this thing if it is legit maybe it's worth a buy and then it's front wheel drive so i don't know i don't know i just thought i'd bring this up not a lot of stuff on this website but occasionally some things do come up and this is one of them this is lucky a scam guys those were all the cars that i could find recently and i will be seeing you all in roughly a month's time with another video just like this but stay tuned and subscribe and like the video it helps me out and there will be some content i am working on the rx7x i'm finished with the gtr and i'm going to take it out the garage and bring the rx-7 in and i'm going to start that big turbo swap once that's done i'm going to take the rb 20 out of the garage and clean it down hose it and then start working on that damn thing so lots of content coming up like i said make sure you're subscribed and i'll see you all next video peace

Title: Is buying an AUTOMATIC RX7 FD3S worth it? POV Drive
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atCvrDYDOUM

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to a brand new video today we're going to be taking the rx-7 ft3s for a quick rip and i'm going to tell you guys exactly what i think about the automatic fd and if you should buy it or not all right guys we've got a point of view inside the automatic 1997 touring x rx-753s what a mouthful i figured i'll show you this car because i bought it in 2016. it was kind of a mistake all know the story if you og's on this channel you'd have noticed that uh well you would have known that i picked up this car when my daughter was born and i had a couple of sleepless nights and i was a little bit despondent about buying rx-7 online or at least in the auction houses because i wasn't winning and i was i was just purely trying my luck with low low balls and whatnot so i bid it on every single fd3s that there was and i got a phone call the following day and uh the guys in japan called me and i said hey you want an fd i was so excited

(Start: 00:01:01)
i then saw the pictures and then saw the grading sheet and it was this car the automatic fortunately for me a couple months later i ended up picking up the silver type rs mp3s which i have at home um that came in completely stock form nothing done to it it had uh 100 and 1000 k's this car has got 140 thousand casts a little bit like anyway one we wanna talk about is is it worthwhile buying an rx seven fd with an automatic gearbox well there's a couple things to it i'm just waiting for the car to warm up before i actually give a little bit but one of the most important things is the price the autos are a lot cheaper and we might say about a lot cheaper if you're gonna take one with the same mileage the same grading the same or similar faults dings and dents and whatnot on the door you're gonna find that these are roughly 40 cheaper than a manual

(Start: 00:02:02)
alternative and that is on its own a game changer i'll tell you something it doesn't rev as high it caps off at six and a half thousand which means you'll generally find these to be a little bit more or rather shall i say a little bit less abused at least that's what i've found the ones that i've i've actually or at least this one and the ones that i've seen they are ha milos but they're running and in the notes on the auction house notes and all that they actually show that the um sorry this person was asleep um they actually show that it's original engine and like for example this one's got 140 000 kilometers in it is original it has not been touched which is bloody ridiculous anyway we're sitting at about 60 k's an hour let's plant it foot down i mean it's not bad

(Start: 00:03:04)
it's not great either there are a lot of cars that are quicker than this it's 188 kilowatts in stock form as an automatic i mean what more could you ask for paying 40 less in getting an fd because then you could chuck this whole box out perhaps get a new uh ec and to be honest you're going to have to get an easier the dash is exactly the same it's just got at the bottom here it shows you what gear you're it's not going to make a difference there's also a little hold button on there or it'll hold led you could probably just take out the little led that controls that and then you shouldn't have any issues but from what i've read on the forums to get one of these converted to a manual you're for sure gonna have to get a new ecu there's some trickery that you've got to do on the wiring and uh obviously a gearbox stuff that makes all of that goodness now the order itself has got a couple i don't know if you want to call them features but it's got

(Start: 00:04:05)
sport low and drive i'm currently sitting in drive sport i'll be honest makes not much difference at all you can feel the ribs climbing up slightly i've got that notorious rev counter issue at the moment but you can you can feel the ribs obviously while you're driving the car with regards to performance when you put it into sport mode you don't see much you'll find that the revs go up slightly higher they go up to about six and a half maybe seven thousand maybe if i pay a little bit attention this time i'll be able to figure out let's try it out i think it's six and a half thousand uh lots are gonna go green in a sec three two one photos planted here we go my roof council doesn't work for what it is

(Start: 00:05:11)
so look a lot of people ask me how much i paid for these cars it was a video that i explained exactly how much i paid for this car bear in mind i bought this in 2016 this is before the hub this is before usa could grab all these cars at a really good price so i'll pick this one up at just under 2 000 us dollars but then again don't don't forget you still gotta pay a thousand plus shipping it's about a thousand four hundred dollar shipping now to south africa you gotta pay duties twenty five percent you gotta pay that fifteen percent then there's a whole lot of other fees that you gotta throw on top of that don't just think because you pick up a car they're cheap that that is how much you're gonna be paying for it at the end because that is not anyway i'm stoked i got it this one's untouched it is completely stock standard i'm going to leave it that way it's even got the phony wheels on it i'm gonna leave it stock and it's gonna forever be that way i don't think

(Start: 00:06:11)
i'll ever sell this car and i don't think i'll even throw an automatic anyway it's still got the torque it's still got the power it's really not bad currently it's running on pump 95 it's still pulling like a freight train 188 kilowatts like i said i think i haven't actually looked at the car figures in quite a while talk 250 but i'll have them flashing on the screen anyway so guys the price of a box and a diff it varies i've found boxes i mean it's in a very country country to be honest i've found boxes here for about seven to eight thousand round um i haven't seen the price on the diff but anyway seven to eight grand plus an ecu you're more than likely going to be throwing something else inside like a microtech

(Start: 00:07:11)
or an apexi powerfc like i have in my other car or anything else that these rotaries seem to like but let's factor the ecu price out because you're more than likely going to get another ec anyway you're just going to be paying for the box you're going to rip all this stuff out and maybe change the dash i don't know and then you've got yourself a manual fd at well let's call it like 35 percent cheaper now that is unbelievable so my answer to the title of this video is it worth owning i don't know titles of you is it worth owning an fd that's automatic something like that um i think so if you're planning on modifying it picking it up cheap it still sounds great you guys can hear that hopefully oh that was a nice little pothole there i've got a cheeky little porsche up in front of me this car will undoubtedly get murdered

(Start: 00:08:11)
by the porsche [Music] so i'm not even a bother but yeah i'll let him think that he has a fighting chance against me let's be honest you see an rx-7 you're gonna think that there's a big big ass turbo behind it you're gonna think that the rotary's been reported although this one you can't hear a thick silent silence on a stock exhaust let's try and get a tad close it looks like a new age porsche i know nothing about them snapping the brakes so this is the perfect one not too obvious [Music] it's a 911 carrera s i bet that porsche is more expensive than every single car and that is a fact

(Start: 00:09:13)
dude looks like he's about 90 years old let's backtrack here we've just arrived at the fd's natural habitat [Music] it's natural feeding ground [Music] i mean this caused light but it's still manageable i just i managed to get through there not a little scraper oh it's such a fun little car i really really really really need to fix myself one and as soon as i fix the silver that's a game changer i hope you guys can hear that little whistle there cheeky little turbo noises [Music] i mean if you dudes watched my stripping

(Start: 00:10:13)
video the the one that i was ripping the turbos out of the my other rx7 you also are smaller they're like keychains if you've ever seen an rb25 turbo that makes the fds turbos look like they don't even exist and the rp35 term is tiny oh this box it's laggy it's not nasty glove i'll be honest i daily drove this for a little bit i was interchanging the let's put it back into driving right now i was daily driving this and the mr2 for a little while for two or three weeks and uh i mean the box is laggy so if i want to plant i'm just okay let's give it a countdown

(Start: 00:11:15)
so i'm busy cruising now one two three now it takes forever to actually mention something but that's your typical auntie's gearbox i mean that was about a second delay before i actually decided to do something my oil pressure is a tad low i have been checking oil [Music] we had this issue with this vehicle i don't know a couple of months ago and i did sort it out by pushing up the idle rpm it was very very low and uh it seems to be a lot better now i'm going to take it on a little uphill see what it can do [Music] mr rd it'll be nice if you stopped let's go the oil pressure's okay what are you planting when you come back down drops anyway my

(Start: 00:12:16)
idol rpm was way off so i adjusted that the car was stalling at every every street rod every every intersection [Music] a lot better anyway i must say sport is a tad better l is crap it's low range it's talking it gives you a lot of grunt off the get guys so if you just want to like pull up a hill or something it gives you a bit of a grunt okay so we got a decently steep hill i'm saying about 50 kills an hour now okay speeding up let's go let's go 40 cars let's go of course we got another porsche in our slope wash dude cayenne turbo you would have killed me too

(Start: 00:13:18)
but no you decide to drive slow on the hill that i'm trying to film okay that was that was fantastic decision waiting for dude but so now he floors it stop [Music] now this being the uh automatic touring x it doesn't have the big brakes like um my type rs model i've got the like almost brembo style brembo size brakes on on that car um this this one's brakes are small but they they're doing the job i mean they honestly work [Music] i've probably got similar brake sizes on my on my skyline i've got evc

(Start: 00:14:20)
yellow i think they're yellow or red or green and when ubc is and the ebc's makes the world a difference now as i was getting it so you could throw ubc's on here there's a lot of raffles and [ __ ] going on in this car hey monkeys monkey monkey monkey um i'm sure you guys can hear i've tried to direct and then it wasn't directing i tried to direct my microphone which is on my big camera over there i was too lazy to set up my lapel and all that i'm not lazy just strapped for time i had the opportunity to jump in the car the reason why the honest truth the reason why i'm filming this video is i'm actually testing out my head mount and my my gear because i promised you dudes in the previous video i said i will take out the r32 gtr for her now i want to make that a banger and i want to set up i've got like two or three of these cameras and i want to set pov and i want to set up one up behind

(Start: 00:15:21)
me and maybe an exhaust camera we're just going for a rip and we're just going to talk a lot of [ __ ] and uh go from there anyway i'm just aimlessly driving around and i'm getting further further away from home oh it was fun a little bit warm over here i'm back at home um i thought i'd show you guys what the engine bay looks like and a new habit that i've started doing because this is a new battery and i just had to buy a battery for the r32 gtr a couple days ago um but anyway this is the engine bay it is completely stock nothing done to it well i don't know if you want to call this a mod but the ast burst and i wanted the stock one couldn't find them at the time so my old man made this thing to hold the stock one back together because the glue breaks and gets brittle and whatnot anyway all good now so closing thoughts on the black rx7 muscle one's right next to it i think if you strap cache and you want to do something later and you don't want to take the chance and perhaps wait until you have the money because

(Start: 00:16:22)
the prices let's be honest the prices are climbing every single day and if that's that's exactly what i did and i bought early i jeopardized everything else i could have thrown the money at the house i could have made the house looking a little bit better but i decided i'm going to think smart and i'm going to buy these cars while i can because the prices have doubled on both cars just over doubled so if that's what you're thinking and you have the money to buy on auto maybe buy it now do your mods later when you can when you can't afford it and you'll be pretty happy like i said in the video i'm not going to be modifying this one because i've already got a modded o3 not off youtube i've already modded rx7 next to it that i still need to finish and throw on the huge whole set server that i've got but closing thoughts strap for cash want an fd badly buy an order go for it it's still a fun car to drive if you want to race it around maybe the auto box isn't so great but for daily commute it's average it's nothing like a lexus but it'll get you by and you'll probably

(Start: 00:17:23)
forget it i mean i complained about the lag and and being a 90s auto because i'm coming out of a lexus is model that's a lot new and the i mean you don't even feel the gear changes it's smooth is better but you do on this thing so you'll feel like oh coming in second and third and fourth and i think that's just four gears but anyway that is the video guys thank you so much for watching i will see how the footage looks and uh i will jump into the r32 gtr as soon as i can rip it around pov and some other cameras thank you so much for watching if you're new to the channel please hit that sub button and uh like the video it helps a lot and guys uh please comment i love chatting to you dudes if you're on a chat on instagram or anywhere else just hit me up thank you so much we'll see you in the next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too

(Start: 00:18:25)
many obstacles you gotta stop it yo all these opinions and all these positions they come in in millions they blocking your vision but no you can't listen that [ __ ] is all fiction cause you hold the power as long as you're dreaming

(Start: 00:04:06)
harnesses are on this is loose ignitors on it's grounded and i've kind of just left tools and whatnot pistols all right let's start this thing up someone asked me the other day why i have these straps here these cable ties in the back because when i put my gopro on the back light i put the straps on and close the boot just to give me a little bit of confidence that it's not going to fall off [Music] okay i did start this car up yesterday it was a little bit lumpy and idle i'm hoping it's gonna be a lot better now the plugs have got stock gap it's 1.1 on the coppers previously i had 0.8 let's see what it does immediately

(Start: 00:05:09)
that is a world of a difference my idol was incredibly lumpy before crazy what plugs can do [Music] really digging this during the day this looks so cool so what i'll do in the next video i'm going to take it for a rip i've actually just charged up my gopro i've charged up my other camera and i've got my it was out in front of me i probably took it inside my head melt so i'm going to look like an idiot and i'm going to drive around with that head mount gopro mounts on my head so you guys can

(Start: 00:06:10)

what's up guys and welcome to a brand new game show named so you think you're jdm tonight i have a contestant all the way from the uk namely super coop or craig welcome thank you very much nelson for having me on on your channel yeah we haven't uh we haven't actually had a chat before we've always spoken in the comments section or a little bit on discord but it's actually nice to be face to face for a change awesome yeah no definitely and it's nice to see you in your garage because that's obviously where i started following you was with with you and your garage you know and this uh blue bad boy behind me well that's what drew me in dude of course i mean you got the blue one as well and uh but we'll get into that in a minute so um super coop has been in the jdm scene for quite a while he's uh has two blue r33s i'll let him get into it in a minute and uh his girlfriend has a mitsubishi gto and you have a donor gto as well which is somewhere

(Start: 00:01:02)
else yeah so i mean yeah tell us tell us a little bit yeah yeah i've got the two there's two skylines um i've had i call them different names because they're both blue as you've mentioned there it gets a bit confusing when i try and explain about the blue skyline yeah so the one that's working at the moment is what we call troublemaker right it's running about 500 horsepower uh the other one that's my older one i bought that in 2014 right that's currently at the end of a rebuild um i haven't gone anything crazy with it it's got just a few bolt ons um i have had the engine started well i haven't the mechanic that's doing the job for me has had the engine started rb 25 still yeah rb25 still the garage turbo the the mods between the two cars are very very similar same turbos just about just a model difference um same exhaust manifolds so they're going to be around about the same so it's going to sound pretty pretty similar as well yes definitely um

(Start: 00:02:04)
obviously one is a little bit more flashy than the other one i'm not sure i think i've gone a little bit overboard with the blinginess because um the rb i've put rb26 rocker covers on the other one as well and they're all polished everything i've gone for in the engine bay is polished so i've probably gone a little bit overboard with it um you know it's apart from cam's exhaust pretty much they're going to be identical cars and what you can see at the base of my picture that's in is the spoiler of my girlfriend's gto mitsubishi gta twin turbo um and it's currently in prep for a show that's coming up this weekend although that car has given you quite a bit of headaches isn't it it definitely has um and it's giving me a headache i'm trying at the the current stage of trying to repair a damage that i made um when i crushed it into the garage door um yes so i'm in the midst of rubbing the bumper down and it's the first time i've done any bodywork so yeah it's i don't know if this is gonna turn out

(Start: 00:03:05)
worse or there's only one only better yeah definitely um and as you mentioned i've got the donor gto which was bought obviously in the hope that we were going to fix the red the the sorry red judeo white junior this white gto because obviously as you mentioned it's it's caused quite a bit of bother for us um so that was used as a parts cog but my my heart's changing and i don't really want to part it out um because they're all becoming quite rare i was just about to say that they are becoming quite expensive and and hard to obtain i mean especially here in south africa i mean if you don't know import laws we we've got horrific laws where we have a governing body that only allows us to bring certain vehicles and those vehicles are deemed as collectors and for example we we cannot get any gtst's no gts no gts model skylines only gtr 32334 uh we can't even import 35's because i don't know how to use that already no it's reduced i don't know how you survive

(Start: 00:04:07)
so for example i mean some of the guys probably don't know whoever's going to subscribe to you guys go and subscribe to supergroup um whoever's going to subscribe to you will uh maybe pick up that your accent isn't quite uk i know i know i get this all the time okay so i grew up in south africa your neck of the woods um well i grew up in zimbabwe technically speaking right but you were born i said yes i was born in johannesburg foxborg boxburg bernoni um you know coming to the uk i've been here 16 years 2004 i came over um you know came over to meet family uh so i'm at that place where i'm i'm foreign both ends so i've got an accent here and if i come back to africa i've got an accident i'm from uk so it's it's it's a tough one i mean i can tell already like when we talking your accent has changed from what it is in the vlogs i can tell you definitely definitely

(Start: 00:05:07)
definitely and i'll do the same i mean so i'm portuguese african if i go and speak to portuguese people my my the way i speak my accent all that will change because you kind of have to fit in yeah but no and i do it like if i if i speak to somebody here that's from here my accent will change to to the way that they speak as well yeah of course you know it's strange how that happens i know that it's yeah human nature i guess but what i was getting at is if you ever had to come back to south africa you could bring your cars and you could bring them back as returning residents yes i wouldn't i would honestly i wouldn't be able to choose i wouldn't be able to choose which ones are brilliant you could bring all of them um and and that's the thing and that's how for example my mr2 is not deemed a collector's item i if i wanted to buy the car in japan i wouldn't be able to i would i would get if i had to import it it would stay at the port and i'd either have to send it back to japan or they would crush it there is nothing i can do with it um the way it came in here was a returning residence someone

(Start: 00:06:09)
went to the uk or whoever and they brought the car back because they liked and they enjoyed it and that is one of the things that i feel that i'm unfortunate being in in south africa because i don't see the cool stuff i don't see the cool cars like you guys have and you are incredibly fortunate being that side of the world where it's probably the third largest jdm community yeah maybe four we do have quite a big community but the question i've got for you is the question i've got for you is how what redeems it a classic or collector's item for you to be able to bring it into oh well see now that that is the the the issue that we have here with this governing body named itec and uh it's basically an import control um i forgot it stands for exactly but import trade association commission of south africa that's itec now these guys there's a a team within them that look at values of vehicles and they see the trends etc and then

(Start: 00:07:10)
they deem the car as a collector's item and they call them internationally collectible cars so it doesn't go on the age of the car or anything like that no no no we do have the age of a car but our age is not 25 like america ours is 40 which sucks which means i'm 19 i was 1994 i would uh be able to get an 84 no hang on my mouse is terrible i would have to get a really old car and it's not something that i won because i only like 90s jane here how do you know where i'm going with this yeah definitely so we have the 40 year rule which doesn't work but the the other one where they deem collectible cards they just don't listen but the crowd that that runs it is a crowd called sava which is african vintage and veteran association now these guys are probably gonna come after me and sue me once they hear this video but they are not interested in anything that is not a model a ford a mgb gt you know

(Start: 00:08:13)
that's you know the mainstream classics yeah they don't care about these things they someone went and told them back then that gtr is cool and rx7 is cool a honda nsx is cool and uh a supra was cool don't even get me started on the supra it's it's a whole candle of fish that it will open up here but we cannot legally import this toyota super anymore and that was pulled away so to answer your question we have a bunch of beep people that are not allowing us to bring in cars that are now treated as collectibles and and i've fought this i've tried i've i've had other people i actually got a group of people to start spamming them um in a nice way just asking them for particular vehicles like yeah the evo 4 the evo 5 the tommy mackinnon edition gtst-4 that sort of stuff and just trying to get the guys to load it onto the system and it's just it's a no-go so for you to be in the uk i think

(Start: 00:09:14)
you're incredibly lucky with regards to the cars you're not lucky with the salted roads and the condition of some of the cars but you are lucky to see cars that i will probably never see in real life and this is why we need to get you eventually here the uk to come to a junk fest with me no because i think you're gonna be blown away you guys heard it from craig on instagram he told me this three days ago plus manas and uh i said i will only go there if i get 100 000 subscribers on youtube i see myself on social blade getting to a hundred thousand when i am close to 65 years old let's make this happen earlier the cars will be right on classic snake classic yeah i know by then i can import them because they'll be definitely 40-plus and there will be nothing left i'll be i'll have to import them from japan from the uk mine will just be a pile of rust

(Start: 00:10:14)
bucket to rust the only one that'll be good is the donor car because i don't have the garage you're right you never know i might actually learn any some skills and i might be able to get it back on the road by then maybe oh i wish you all the best but um craig are you i mean since you're in the garage don't don't you just want to show you the guys your toys whatever you got what's cool what's in the garage okay cool right so i've actually got you currently sat so forgive the state of the place because i'm in mid mid process i'm pretty sure but i'm not using the most conventional spreader uh it's an old bank card so don't don't think about trying to get anything just gonna pause and edit yeah um car is covered in plastic because we're going to try and do some paint skyline i shall do a little bit of a tour guide at the front to give the uh skyline number one oh man i don't have skyline number two um because that's at a garage but uh

(Start: 00:11:17)
this door should be open give me more room give me more room for you to look at the gto sitting everywhere i've got calm covers struck braces hang on i saw something interesting i've got to interject that directly below you there's a bunch of planks of wood what's the story of this okay well the problem that i've got when i moved into this house because it is a rented property is you know you come and look at a house and you don't really want to um be that guy that says can i have a look at the garage you know because it's more important than what the house is yeah so i just left it but we got the keys and i opened the garage for the first time i realized that there was a problem modified car big body kit and uh i have i don't know if you can see that lip there's about an inch lip there yeah the rest of the driveway goes down that way so i decided to make my own ramps because i was tired of using all my bricks um if you

(Start: 00:12:18)
obviously looked at any of my videos you'll notice that i had a brick lay the iconic bricks yeah yeah to get the car out so my neighbor currently kindly donated a couple of flanks of wood and i made my own ramps so those are the ramps that i need to get the cars in and out of the garage so much time saved by doing that you know i was just about to say that was a good 10 10 15 minutes with the bricklayer definitely but i had it down to a t i honestly had it down to a t and i actually got some subscribers just for the bricks because they're just laughing at me i haven't thrown the bricks away and they will be coming back maybe a support for vehicles when i've got this up in the air you know because um probably some big things coming with the geo um potentially your width ways in the car so on trolley dolly's widthways upper height and we're gonna spend some time on it but that's the garage it's a mess but uh yeah it's actually surprising to see i mean i've been to

(Start: 00:13:19)
the uk a few times and not in the recent years but uh you generally see single garages and or no garage and everybody's road parking or at least yeah i went um so i went to the heart of london the usual piccadilly or all of that but it's unusual to see a double garage and we've been very lucky with this honestly very lucky with it i actually lived literally 20 houses down the road um when this came up for rent you know it's um it ticked all the boxes so we've been pretty lucky we weren't the only few in this estate that have got a double garage my neighbor across the road just got a single this one here has got a single so we've been pretty pretty damn lucky it was cool i got to ask you since it's directly behind you kuruma uk you got to tell me a little bit about that okay kuruma uk i'm actually wearing the hoodie it's a bit loud in your face yes it's um it's my japanese car club and we started in 2015.

(Start: 00:14:20)
um kuruma is the japanese word for car so basically a [ __ ] club and uh yeah so we're on instagram and it's on facebook you know there's there's two different pages for facebook there's the actual club um we obviously can participate comments and stuff like that and then we've got a normal generic page for kuruma but i mean the main thing for us on kuruma at the moment is instagram got you okay cool and um yeah that's it's you know we try and house unfortunate thing with with car clubs these nowadays is and covert 19 going on it's very difficult to do anything as a club as a unit you know so it's unfortunately swaying everything towards being online just constantly is the club specific to your area or can anybody join anybody can join i've got um in fact i have a member that's in america he was the very first member that i got from abroad and renee shout out to rena if he ever watches this you know um he i send him out some some stickers for his cars um big ones because i used to my older

(Start: 00:15:22)
other skyline has kuruma down the doors and stuff um i shall send you a picture if you want um so you can get an idea of it and he wanted the same thing and i sent him all the pictures all the stickers and he was he liked the club that much just being active and part of it on facebook but he actually wanted to make a kuruma u.s so we might look at it you know number nine kuruma sa kurumi uk here we can talk i am putting stickers down the side of my cars though nice and anybody can join anybody who's more than welcome to come and participate you know because it's after like i say with this whole cove at 19 you know it's uh it's very difficult to do with things of course of course before we dive into the questions um i got to ask you why should people subscribe to your youtube channel super coop well i'd like people to subscribe english and mainly obviously if you like to follow

(Start: 00:16:24)
the the story behind the cars the gdo i mean there's not many of them around uh the story of skylines what it's like to own two skylines and how broke i am financially um but also that i'd like to think that i'm a down-to-earth person i keep it real so what you'll see on my camera is what you'll see if you came and met me um and that's one of the the most positive feedbacks that i've had from people that are watching my videos is that i keep it real i'll embrace the mistakes so if i if i'm tongue-tied i won't edit it out and be polished i'll i'll laugh at it um my latest vlog was a bit quite an embarrassing vlog for me to make because i did the full video and i realized that i looked completely dreadful because my hair was all over the place i haven't ignored the fact that it's life we're natural i'm just an average joe um and you know that's that's one of those things the other thing i'm trying to start now with with super coop is cinematics i've invested quite a lot in time effort and not only gear but trying to learn that

(Start: 00:17:25)
skill of trying to become a movie maker and true and i'm trying to do and invite people to my channel so not only are you seeing my life with my cars um you're also getting to see other people in their builds and that kind of stuff and every video should be different that with that is also the features as well i've done a few features and the features every feature differs one way shape or form you know and that's that's true i mean i've seen all of your features and it's you do a hell of a good job storytelling so whether it's the interviews with the uh with the of people and their cars uh the storytelling side of things it's it's impressive um seeming as that you're quite new to the scene thank you so i've got to say something and that's uh monkey london you gotta watch out buddy thank you nelson that obviously means a hell of a lot genuinely it doesn't mean i have a long because you know is is many times that i've i've edited a video in the first person that's going to see my videos my girlfriend um and she's my biggest critic and yeah don't get me wrong she's never

(Start: 00:18:25)
always agreed but she's the one that i need to listen to and there's been times i've said look i'm not happy with the video and she's like no that's great and i've had nothing but positive feedback from it it's a learning curve i'm not perfect um but i'm having fun doing the features i did a few did a feature yesterday of an evo four um the owner of that car what a funny guy absolutely had me in stitches um you know and another thing about that evo if you'd like to to watch because that should be going live quite soon is it's completely stock with very little miles on it it's quite a special car um so yeah it's it's just i try and keep it real you know if i'm gonna make a mistake you're gonna see it with me you know sometimes it's a bit embarrassing trying to keep those mistakes going when it comes to cars you know um because i think that i should know more being a jdm lover a car lover yeah um but we all learn we all got to start somewhere for sure for sure so guys uh go jump on link in the description

(Start: 00:24:34)
it is a shitty low res picture of this on purpose okay so was it just the one picture or just two no no i'm just letting you have a good look at that one well and rust bucket number oh what's your thoughts without sending another picture i'm trying to look at the wheels the wheels look quite beefy but there's nothing nothing much that i can see from that just a bunch of scrap metal um all right incoming this one's hard this one's gonna get me fox nelson okay there's no way as i can tell what car this is i think that's an indicator on the rear club take a guess you've got 10 seconds i'm gonna go toyota cressida final answer the crusader incoming large picture okay that's the skyline r32 not just any r32 it's uh gtr is it a gto

(Start: 00:25:35)
as well jeez i'm just going back through the pictures to see if i could could have made that i couldn't have made that i cropped it i cropped it on the boot so you didn't see the little um not the emblem the keyhole because the keyhole would have just given it away yeah and i think i've seen that badge i would have had of course of course i couldn't let you win this oh no well so that's five out of 12 so far we've got 12 questions but before we get into the rest okay i want to ask you your opinion on a few vehicles okay and the first one being this beautiful toyota mr2 i'm being facetious when i say beautiful but i mean you can decide is it hot or not that's all i want to know so i've obviously got to give you an opinion as is i can't guess not not in the car itself i know you like mr2s or whatever but

(Start: 00:26:37)
i want to know this particular mr2 what do you think about it i'm gonna say it's hot i'm gonna say it's good okay yeah there's no right or wrong answer it's just for us to figure out what you cut it into and and for me really yeah that ticks all the boxes it's a loud color it's not your standard color it's clearly being modified you've got a nice front aftermarket bumper um yeah so i'm gonna say yeah do it it's hot i thought you'd like it obviously if it was blue it would be a bit better i think it looked quite good next in the orange i think it'll look quite good next to the blue so i'd probably keep it that color true story yeah next one hot or not this is uh well let's see actually um no points in this do you know what car this is that looks like a morgan it's very [ __ ] jdm you're not going to get more jdm than this

(Start: 00:27:39)
now this is the annoying thing nursing because i've seen a picture of this car before and i couldn't believe what car it was and i can't remember what car it is now i'd love to have one of these uh so this is a mitsuka yet so that's the name of what that is now but there is no what it does now what it used to be i'll send you the interior okay oh you can just guess for the for the [ __ ] of guessing no points and by the way guys whoever's watching there is gonna be a leaderboard craig is not the only contestant that's gonna be coming on the show whoever gets the top by the end of the season i'm planning to have about eight to ten um some guys with large amount of subscribers 50k subs etc are gonna be joining and uh we're gonna have some fun we're gonna do similar things i'll probably try make a little bit harder for them and hopefully one day we can get likes of tommy effia maybe adam lz i'm wishful thinking but yeah we'll see and uh we're going to have a leaderboard running at the end of the season there will be a prize

(Start: 00:28:39)
and it will go out to whoever has the highest number four points so craig uh looking at that interior uh do you know what car that is what's the skyline see about the seat is that a scarlet no that's an s3 no no it's an s13 that's an s30 in my country will be a 200 sx uh but it's a 180 that side of the world so these cars um there were a bunch that were taken into the matsuoka factory and they were all the rps 13s all of them auto [ __ ] boxes and they were all taken on like all every single one ni they were left automatic they were left in a and they were all converted obviously cut chassis they're extended and they're fully rode legal cards and they are branded mitsuhuka lesser yet and it's pretty impressive i would love to get one of these they're super cheap i mean they go from anywhere between three and

(Start: 00:29:40)
four thousand us dollars uh actually some are a bit higher depending on on model and cleanliness and all that but they're quite cheap and i would love to try get this onto the collectors list but i live in south africa but hot or not what do you think honest opinion it's not something i would add to my own collection so i'm going to give it a knot all right so i'm going to send you something and and this is a kind of like a cult car here in south africa tell me what you think about it yes i'll give that a big big heart um well nissan champers i remember them and yeah they you know that i think i've probably only seen one in the uk and um yeah so and it's their rear wheel drive nippy little things if you put the right engine like an sr20 it's quite a common thing to do yeah it's called throwing a rotary yeah definitely definitely a big big big yes i would love to have one okay just

(Start: 00:30:40)
money doesn't allow they all over the place here i mean i could probably send you up one fourth next to nothing but then obviously import duties and all that [ __ ] but these these things are everywhere and like i said it's a cult car here in south africa and there's so many cars here in south africa that a lot of people in the world just kind of adore like we've got the mazda capilla which i believe was an essay only car we've got that uh datsun uh it's a 160 zed or something my favorite car do you know which ones yes it was they had the round lights yeah yeah multiple like six red lights yeah that's it that car only yeah there was only over 200 made or something something like that all came to south africa every single one yeah i'll tell you a story about that the 160z um when i was 18 many moons ago i had my first car that my mom gave me and my cousin was absolutely jealous that i got a car

(Start: 00:31:42)
for my 18th and he went to his dad and said look you know i want to call for my 18. yeah so he came home from school one day and there was this blooming car on the driveway and it was a 160z just a shell and he was absolutely devastated he says no i want a working car and he said no and he started was a fully qualified mechanic and said no you fix the car up and you can have the car and it was full body kit wide-arched it had banded steelies on and i was so jealous of that car i wanted that car that would be two but yeah 160z if i if i could get one of them i'd be i'd be made oh yeah no they're crazy i don't know if you know about this guy here i mean we digressing quite a bit uh but that's what it's all about on this new game show it's it's to get to know the creator to get to know myself a bit more um i don't know if you've heard of this guy he's in south africa and his name is he actually got quite a funny name is freak the [ __ ] have you heard about it is legit his name now this dude i might get the number slightly off but he has between a hundred and twenty and a

(Start: 00:32:43)
hundred and eighty nissans and datsuns i [ __ ] you not we'll chat about it offline i'll show you i'll link you some of the stuff so he's now turned his little farm into a uh museum a datsun listen museum he owns 34 32 33 he's got different variants of them a lot of them are brought in as returning residents that he's bought off people 300 zx like all of them 280zx he's got that 160. uh he collects really old ones like the 120 wires that sort of stuff 140s so i've got pictures probably flashing on the screen right now while i'm talking so go back onto this video and check it out listen champs uh you name it he's also got i'm gonna say this wrong hakosuka gtr wow yes like the original skyline like it came a month after this car it was supposed to be on the same ship as my car we bought them at the same time we bought them a few days apart it's 69 as far as i know and it is

(Start: 00:33:43)
original there's a full feature film it was actually owned by someone in yakuza and it was signed i'll show you this feature film offline uh because i've seen it today the future 200 plus 250 000 plus subscribers uh they've made an insane feature film that show off his car and he talks freak talks about his car and his collection and he states in there that he's bought all these cars for his children's children he'll never sell any of them and it is absolutely insane and uh that's definitely something i'd like to to watch and start following all right so let's jump right into it i'm going to give you six different vehicles a few pictures i'm going to tell you the auction grading i'm going to tell you the amount of kilometers the car had when it went for sale and what year model it was from there you need to figure out how much this car sold for unfortunately i've got to work on a standard here and it's not going to be in pounds it's going to be in us dollars but it's close enough call it 20 percent

(Start: 00:34:44)
less than what pound is okay and the first one coming your way honda nsx wow these are starting to fetch big money they are uh they're obviously deemed across the world as collectors items i am sending you a front rear and interior picture and i'll do this for every single vehicle if you can tell me how much you think it is this car is a 1991 so it's one of the first ones it has quite a low amount of kilometers or medium it's 94 000 kilometers and it is unfortunately an automatic it's in a yeah they're all in a yeah yeah what am i thinking of yeah i was going to say automatic yeah automatically because i noticed the gear stick that's the first thing i look for is the what gearbox is in it um you see this is it this is where it throws me because of the the automatic gearbox i'm gonna give you

(Start: 00:35:44)
to the closest two thousand dollars either way you've got ten seconds to give me a price i'm gonna say thirty thousand final answer final answer 39 000 us dollars hey i'm way off my first in my mind it was 35 i was going to say 35. you would have been close but you still wouldn't have taken the cake but i'm a nice guy i probably would have given it to you [Laughter] all right now this one you cannot get wrong oh no pressure gto okay now to be honest this is a difficult one this is a difficult one because gto's fluctuate in price you can pick gto's up for as little as 1500 pounds all the way up to 12 000 pounds well let me give you the specs and then you can make your an idea of what it is it is a twin turbo variant it's a 91 so it's early model okay the

(Start: 00:36:47)
same as this one okay it has 229 000 kilometers on it and it is a manual i'm gonna say three and a half thousand euros dollars okay that kind of mileage honestly i forgot to mention i was going to give you 500 either way okay the price is thousand seven hundred and seventy one us dollars jeez so that was a hell of a good guess i personally would have said who would have gone for more yeah now that these fluctuate in i mean we obviously before we bought uh gto um we went to go and look at one and it was as little as it was 1500 quid but it was an absolute and it was a twin turbo as well full driving full mot everything um you know so they do fluctuate and then the guy that swayed it to buy one his he was 11 and a half that's what he paid for his and you know they they fetch such a high amount of money here and i'm gonna speak in iran's because you are familiar with that but they all go for over and 130

(Start: 00:37:49)
thousand around here in south africa because we can't import them they were brought in as as returning residents and there's not many around for sure the next one i'm gonna send you is an mr2 okay this is an sw20 i will give you the specs as soon as i finish sending so this is a 1996 it is a gts so it is a turbo variant 3s gte has 158 000 kilometers and it is a manual oh this is a tough one because i'm not really clued up on my mr2s even though i used to own one um i'm gonna give it four and a half thousand us dollars okay final answer final answer this car sold for seven thousand seven hundred and fourteen ah you still do you're still doing well

(Start: 00:38:50)
i mean we on what number eight number nine yeah all the questions and you've got six six out of nine so far that's terrible it's terrible well that's the whole thing so you think you're jdm i know i know let myself down yeah i used to have one of them years ago 2010. that's the problem it was years ago the price has changed it was probably 400 back then my mine lasted a full month and 17 days of my ownership did you record i did i wrote it off sorry man at least you're okay the uh sugary okay turbo non turbo it looks like a non no no no the this is the turbo model this is a w it's a it's a legit wrx okay so yeah obviously the sti had a bigger wing yeah this is a wrx so they were slower they had a smaller turbo

(Start: 00:39:51)
uh brakes weren't as big they're quite a few things smaller intercooler but the chassis is the same the ej20 is the same uh very similar this one would have a semi-closed deck block and a bunch of other goodies i'm not gonna go into it i used to love zebras i still do but i need these and yeah this is the thing this is out of my comfort zone so that i'm gonna go with i'll go i'll give you i'll give you before you give me an answer uh a thousand dollars either way oh sorry this is a two 2000 model 142 000 kilometers it is a manual and it is the turbocharged variant ej2022 i'm going to say four thousand dollars are you watching my [ __ ] screen here this car sold for four thousand four hundred us dollars really oh i figured let me go for wrx because it would be cheaper yeah instead of me showing you an sti

(Start: 00:40:52)
because they're all generally more expensive honestly i don't know much about these cars at all that was just a wild guess you know you get jdm but you get different types of lovers jdm car lovers you get the mitsubishi out the honda girls i mean i i'm like more mainstream and i believe you are too and this wouldn't really fall into mainstream uh you've got two more to answer okay this one i believe you would absolutely adore and love to earn certainly gtr baseline blue not not a gtr it's not a geo no no no you can see the spoiler is different the rear quarters are different the gtt now you see the interior it is a they call it a 25 gt but it is a gtt okay so this is a turbo it's a turbo uh rb25 turbo uh 1988 model yeah it is in here

(Start: 00:41:54)
1998 model 153 000 kilometers it is a manual and i forgot to give you gratings on the other ones but this is a three and a half uh grating with a c interior and a c exterior meaning it's just average okay i'm gonna give it eight and a half i will give you a thousand dollars either way final answer eight and a half final answer you realize america has pushed up the price like crazy i know but the thing is i'm looking at prices from what we've seen them go here um you know and considering that it's not that neat the u.s is not importing from there are they yeah that's it you know um and and from what i know that people have tried to ask for their cards and it's just never happened and it probably was a very low ball answer that to be honest because

(Start: 00:42:54)
very much very much so because the 33 is some of the people that have bought 33s i can't believe what they've paid you know because i didn't pay that yeah um so i've probably sh yeah i've shot that down haven't i you have and you screwed it it sold for 14 210 us dollars yes big chunk of money that is uh oh yeah definitely you wouldn't believe when i told you i paid way less than that i'm not going to tell you the full price on camera but i paid way less for my r32 gtr like way way less i can imagine you know it's astonishing and how much the prices have skyrocketed in the last six seven years because i nearly had the chance at um buying an r33 gtr v spec for seven and a half thousand pounds 2012. that was that was the asking price i don't know i paid more than that for gdst and i see

(Start: 00:43:55)
that i do a lot of uh toilet reading with uh your magazines i'm pretty sure you buy them too uh japanese performance and banzai yeah okay so i've got a whole stack full yeah me too i i have to import them from the uk you're not expensive to import them because they're heavy yeah that's i might send you some pictures so i might send you some magazines no no pressure but make sure you haven't got them first you know what i mean i think the last one i have is from like 2014 i stopped buying them when we've also got up now i've got really old ones as well like collecting from 2006 yeah yeah they could go through because i've got a massive pile yeah and you know i think it's like midway to the end you've got that new era dealership and in those magazines they show uh pricing of like a pretty cool jdm cars and and an r32 for like six and a half with full

(Start: 00:44:56)
veil side kit and and and and madness anyway back to the questions talking about gtrs this is a legitimate gtr it is an r32 i will give you the full specs as soon as it's up um that is not accident damage the bonnet is open i'm assuming the battery is flat or something they forgot to close it so don't worry about the open bonnet and there is your interior picture you make the decision uh from i'll i'll try to help you out here but from the picture it looks like it's got an electronic boost controller in it uh and that's pretty much that stock steering wheel stock gear knob it's got some sort of sat nav which was worthless completely worthless and it's very electronic toll collection system on it which is worthless um it's stock body completely stock body except for the wheels

(Start: 00:45:56)
and it is a 1990 with 280 sorry 218 000 kilometers and obviously it's a manual because it's a 32 gtr it is a 3.5 grading so it's just above average with a c exterior very average and a d interior slightly worn but still okay how much just the closest two thousand dollars would you say this car is where i'm probably gonna kick myself for this but i'm gonna say 28 thousand dollars final answer final answer all right bear in mind if my math is actually working probably not you're currently sitting on seven out of 12 questions oh 28 000 is incorrect this car sold for two thousand twenty two thousand six hundred and

(Start: 00:46:58)
nineteen dollars geez so it's a lot less than i was expecting virginia's go off than that i found one uh do you know that one red color yeah it was at the auction's high mileage 360 000 kilometers stock body it sold for 15 000 us dollars it's more than likely going to the us and everything else this was the next cheapest car that sold in the auctions in the last plus minus a month and everything else was 27 28 there was one for 39 ridiculous but that's the thing you know because you're thinking all the other skylines are going up in price because the 34s are just they're going stupid now i don't know um you know but um so i kind of thought that they would be the same being as not as many of them although um yeah clearly proved wrong there you're 60 percent jdm yeah

(Start: 00:48:01)
and we need to be better well yeah technically so am i but i would probably fail a lot of these if you had to ask me guys this is it for the video i hope you enjoyed this series this is so you think you're jdm super coop craig go give him a follow uh on instagram uh what is instagram uh supercoop underscore r33 go hit him up on instagram and on youtube supercreep links will be in the description give him some love not just because he's a fellow african but because he has a super cool car collection and runs an awesome channel guys thank you so much for watching we'll see you all in the next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be a pro

Title: I Bought So Many Parts From Japan!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2xOSVvGrVc

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome back to the channel i am back in my garage it's been a little while i've been doing a lot of sit down videos talking about japanese car auctions castle south africa all sorts of junk anyway you guys have been giving me some support either way and uh i appreciate it anyway i want to show you guys what i've been doing and uh one of the things is not exactly i32 related i need to change the plugs in this car i'm going to make a point to do it in the next few days and then i want to take it out on the road i'm not going to go anywhere in particular i just want to take it for a nice rip around and i'm going to set up the gopro and get some footage um rx7 chilly that's the silver fd we'll get we'll get to that in a sec so the the silver fd i still need to put on this big-ass turbo thanks to jacques for sending that through and this time time time is running away from me i'll put out a posts on instagram asking if anybody is interested in editing my vlogs and uh

(Start: 00:01:00)
sending me the final edits and a couple of people came through uh it's just not working out so far logistical issues and whatnot um but yeah i mean i can do the content it's just time afterwards anyway what i've been working on uh let's talk about let's talk about what i've been buying first so i've i picked up a whole bunch of pots right these last few weeks i've been smashing the yoho auctions and i'm just going to tell you a little bit i've got a reference on my phone yeah let's sort of some of the junk that i've been picking up i picked up four four tech wheel caps i don't know which if it came off a silvia or tech or what not but they all take wheel caps i picked up some rally sparkler wheel caps too then i picked up an r34 gtr side mirror yes a side mirror from r34 gtr it looks like it's in good condition uh i figured you know what maybe build a car out of a whole bunch of pots no i'll just forget about the damn thing because it was cheap then i bought

(Start: 00:02:03)
an hks turbo tama it's one of the first ever turbo timers that were made and apparently still works with vintage turbo timer and i'm pretty keen on getting it and i'll explain why i'm keen on getting it then i bought an fet turbo timer also super cheap then i bought an electronic toll collection system a talking one the exact same one that is in my silver rx-7 then i picked up this is pretty cool i picked up an hks sbc um this is a boost controller and it's missing the solenoid i picked it up for one japanese yen you heard me right one japanese yen so that's 16 cents south african obviously they're shipping and all that sort of stuff that goes into it but one japanese yet dude spelt it wrong on the few auctions and i'll kind of just sit on this thing all day most of the nights and i pick up good deals like this so all i need this thing apparently still worked all i need is a solenoid i'll find the solder i'd put the two together and i've got a cheap boost controller

(Start: 00:03:04)
right and then a lot of you guys have been complaining about my dildo for a gear knob in the r32 gtr and that is finally coming out and i bought this i think you call it neochrome uh razzo gearstick it's it's cool it's gonna go in 32 gtr maybe i'll do a giveaway and get rid of this blue one and uh there'll be some sentimental value because i've been sitting on the car since the inception of this channel then i picked up a gritty trust exhaust temperature gauge it's a 60 mil gauge it's got the probe it's got everything the wiring so that's cool then i picked up a twin turbo pipe much like the one that's on my rb 26 rod now the reason for picking one up is because i want to cut it and i want to do that mod where you uh basically get the airflow from the rear tube and the front turbo to run i'm lost forwards again it provides better airflow roll the clip picture i really don't think this video through

(Start: 00:04:06)
i'm winging this just by the bar then i won an hks turbo timer i had one of these in one of the gc8wrx's and i always wish that i pulled it out because it looked cool it had orange lights in it i got one of those then i won some apexi what do you call these things coil leads gosh the apexi leads from your spark plugs to the coil pack that coil beads whatever for the silver fp then and i'm pretty stoked about this one i picked i up someone just crashed outside my house but anyway um i picked up yes and i have a spare yeah hks evc5 or evc z2 depending on which area so i've got a complete unit here already and i just picked up another one for next to nothing and it comes with

(Start: 00:05:07)
and i've already seen this picture but it'll put some writing on the screen it came with another gauge and i forgot if it's a greedy or blitz the picture's tiny anyway that's what i've won you guys are probably wondering i've been buying a whole lot of crap that i'll never use well you've got that right and i'll tell you why because i've been building myself a jdm box you might have seen this on my instagram as you can see he has a bunch of turbo timers where you cut a hole for one turbo timer and i mean it fits okay it's kind of hard to force with one hand in the air but you get the idea um i'm gonna have this box i've got an ignition switch on here and i've got an on off switch for power constant and basically i'm hoping it's going to be alright but this is 12 volt two and a half amps and it should be about to power everything so what i'm going to do is i'm going to wire these devices to the ignition

(Start: 00:06:09)
switch to the on switch and then what i can do is flip the switch where are my switches such a mess now everything's in such a rush so for example here's my switch and let's say everything's on i'll hit the ignition switch off and all my turbo timers will get beep beep beep and they'll start counting down and all that now the reason i'm doing this is because i've got all these parts i don't want them to just lie around and do nothing i actually want to see them and i figured i'd build this box obviously i'd make it nice and pretty once i'm done trim the edges put some sort of uh i don't know like a vinyl wrap on it maybe or just spray it back i don't know it's masonite on here smooth this model jdm box and since i've been picking up stuff up i mean i figured why the hell not and if you guys are watching and you've got old gauges and old turbo timers old boost controllers and if you have no use for them don't want them swinging them my way let me know maybe we can strike some sort of a deal all

(Start: 00:07:11)
cool little things that i'm just going to throw into this box like i said i'd love to see this up somewhere and i can switch it on and off and just admire because it's always nice to jump into the cockpit of the car even if you're not going to drive it like on a rainy day or something and just look at the cockpit look at the dash look at all that the goodness and then same goes for this maybe this can sit on my desk or something while i'm filming videos then i'm going to take you to the cardboard because i've got some exciting news you guys remember the carport i had the mr2 and the black rx-7 here in the shed right at the end well now it's a big mess first of all no more to no rx-7 and holy crap the shed is gone and this still needs to be sorted out and closed up i'll start closing up some of the panels closing up and filling all these little holes i just need to obviously paint all of this again see i've been filling up everything closing up let me put some boards up i need to close that hole and the shed is gone now at the bottom of my garden behind the

(Start: 00:08:13)
tree i've got a brand new big shed and that goes all the way up to the wall so that's my tool shed for gardening and warm noise and all that sort of stuff so this big ass mess is getting sorted out and excuse the wind noise but basically i'm gonna go out to like somewhere like there and then come all the way across up to this unpainted fence fill this all up and then i'm going to close it up with these boards you can see these are rbr sheeting plastic ibr sheets and there's someone there wagging his tail put some more sheets there's a little door put more of these pillow things up uprights and then more the sheets across close it up more sheets here up to there close it up and obviously i'm going to be closing that little board and eventually this whole area will be nice and closed and that is the plan because i need a little bit more space

(Start: 00:09:14)
and doing something like that it's not going to allow me an entire car i was hoping initially that it would because oh that'll be awesome and you know what that means that means bringing in another vehicle but um i'd have to get plans and all that so that's as far as i can go where i showed you guys but it's more than enough room to actually put a work table workbench and some other cool stuff in there and then obviously do some lighting and and whatnot um anyway that's exciting news it's a little bit a little bit of a waffle in this video so i hope you guys don't mind uh i am going to get two things i'm getting there slowly you know baby life and toddler life and husband laugh and blah blah blah blah this thing still been sitting for a little while i am going to get to knees it needs a hell of a hose down decrease clean and then i'm going to start tearing it down i have filmed a video to get it to this point but i decided not to put it out there um that's pretty much it like i

(Start: 00:10:15)
mentioned here this car needs those plugs and then i'll get this thing out of here and the rx7 must come in and i'll start working on that turbo good to chat to you guys in the comment section keep up the comments i love chatting to you guys if you guys want to chat even further hit me up on instagram go follow me on tick tock i've been hitting the tick tock quite a bit recently and i don't know if i'm gonna say it successful but i've been getting a couple of views and likes which is nice thank you so much for watching really appreciate it i'll see you all next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be a pro don't waste your time no more who the [ __ ] are you to tell me what to do i don't give a damn if you say you disapprove i'm gonna make my move i'm gonna make it soon and i'll do it cause it's what i wanna [ __ ] do

Title: Japanese Car Auctions : Top Picks of September 2020
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHqK7cAABLo

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to a brand new video we're looking at japanese car auctions and these are the best cars that i could find in september of 2020. hope you don't mind the new camera angle i'm just trying something different let's get right into this video the first car that we've got is the nissan skyline r32 gtr it is a 1992 model it's got 166 thousand k's in it but a grading of r c c so c for interior c for exterior which means it's just average r meaning something has been rebuilt something has been done to the car clearly you can see that there's some pretty ugly i'm gonna say ugly reebok guards don't hate on me livery on the car and uh well probably one of the first things that'll come off so just looking at the car let's go back to the first picture there is a lot of road rash on it would more than likely respray i don't know if this is vinyl or it's been painted on i highly doubt it was pretty vital

(Start: 00:01:00)
um not much to say in the front other than the mirrors are changed it's got the in one bumper there are some boot or trunk latches if you want to call in that looks like the car is load probably sitting on coilovers it has aftermarket exhaust interior-wise it's got a massive gauge probably boost aftermarket steering wheel don't ever make there's a loose wiring there [Music] i don't know what the wiring is but i do not know what this is i wonder if there's a cup holder weird see a nismo thing on the surround it looks cheese the reason why i threw it up here is because of the price it came in at a decent twenty two thousand dollars all that stuff that i showed it can be fixed it's not bad i rated this probably the best r32 gtr not anything else at the auctions in september because of the price and because fixing it up

(Start: 00:02:01)
doesn't seem so bad because just aesthetics moving right on we have got ourselves here a mitsubishi evo 4 what a beaut so creating a 3.5 just above average bb means really good interior so a is brand new goes all the way up to e e means that it's screwed cigarette holes torn seats you yeah you get that idea so we've got a car that's sold for 8086. it's all-wheel drive it's got the 4g63 turbo engine 997 model 145 000 kilometers i felt that this one is decent because it is from what i can see in standard form it's got a little bit of stickers and probably some paint issues it is an evo for neat interior stock looking interior there's two gauges up here it looks like they are not drilled onto

(Start: 00:03:01)
the dash which is great this cup holder here some gauges in the didn't slot by the radio i mean other than that it looks pretty damn stock if you look at the issues on the car it's the wheels are really good it's a good grading of four from one to five five being the best um so basically brand new tires uh wheels themselves won't have any scratches or minimal and then you've got a few dents and scratches this car i felt was a really good buy due to its condition and the price right now this one has got nothing to do with the price because this car sells for 55 000 us dollars it is a type rs model just like mine my silver rx-7 is a type rsa but this one's a 2001 minus a 1997. our interiors are almost identical except for the steering wheel obviously this is the latest steering wheel looks a lot better um let's jump straight into the grading

(Start: 00:04:03)
it's got 16 000 kilometers in this 2001 model it's a so that means i said earlier it was brand new a is brand new it can also mean it's really really good if you get a 5 rating 5 means brand new so a really really really good 5 brand new this is a 4.5 it's as close as you can get to brand new xx means that something has been touched up and fixed but it's been done well looking at the pictures of this car is stock it's got stock wheels it's got stock bumpers it's got a stock wing i mean that one did come stock with these cars later gin it's got stock exhaust it's got those twin pops beautiful beautiful looking cot interior like i said looks almost identical to mine obviously i've modified mine it's got white dials one's got black dials so the black dials and the steering wheel is what's on mine it's slightly different and then there's an rd wheel just by the way but it is stock standard i like this cd player tape player

(Start: 00:05:06)
i wish i still had that in my car not that i've got any tapes but oh look at this look how pristine and well kept they've put things on the indicator [Music] i can see why this car sold for 55. i mean i did say price for everyone else but this one it's it's a little bit expensive and it does start at 49 000. so i actually wonder how many bids it took to get 55. we'll never know a nissan skyline this is a r34 it is not a gtr it's a four-door and uh it's got an rb 25 in it from what i can see is that it's likely the det so it's the rb25det the reason why i say that is it's right here in front of me it says rb25de dash rb25 det 80 to empty

(Start: 00:06:09)
so what the guy's done it was initially a 25 de non-turbo they swapped it out for a det turbocharged version and they took the automatic transmission and swapped it out for a manual transmission so this car would have sold for probably 3 000 to 4 000 us dollars around there but it sold for just over 10 000 because obviously these swaps are oh pushing up the value a little bit it's got a blood intercooler which is really cool it's got a gritty something on the car um i'm guessing these are worx wheels and maybe euros wheels i don't know it says worki it's very like electronic toll collection system and it's got an this is apex issue it's apexe power fc more than likely let's take a look at the pictures off the market bumper there's a big blitz interpreter it's definitely been dropped definitely on some coilovers i just i don't know

(Start: 00:07:10)
which ones uh nice little wing nice big side skirts big rear bumper i don't know what this hold is about maybe the apexi sits there who knows um that is a ber power builder it's a rev builder so that that thing cuts fuel or spark i forgot which one and it it's a cheap way to get anti-lag it's not a great way but it is a cheap way to get anti-like he's got on the car what else do you have my friend off the market steering wheel don't have to make aftermarket gear knob missing the cover on the handbrake thingy don't know what that is those look like what do you call them refreshers lost words there um decent overall decent con see the apexy powerfc hand

(Start: 00:08:12)
controller he's likely just got the ecu anyway great buy if you're into getting modified cars and it's an unusual one because of the four-door i like it we've got another skyline again not a gtr this is a gtst type m which means it is all-wheel drive it has an rb20dt and it is in this gorgeous wine color it's this red wine color they refer to now a couple telltale signs there's a lot of people just looking and skyline it's a gtr obviously the front bumper goes down whereas the gtr ends over there and it's also got some pretty girls sorry i'm in bonnet the bumper itself vastly different even if it's the normal spec not the n1 spec vastly vastly different the wing on the back is different the side mirrors are the same on all specs same with the r34 r33 etc etc side skirts missing spats there's quite a few things that you can actually differentiate and see

(Start: 00:09:14)
that well it's not a gtr however the rear taillights and this piece is gtr the entire rear bumper is gtr on all models and the boot gtr obviously the spoiler is not and brake brakes of vastly different wheels very much different and the seats inside are different including the dash i forgot to mention that too so on the r32 gtr dash you will have a turbo thingy this little boost gauge and it shows high cast and it shows a couple of other things so as mentioned on the interior there are a couple things that are different it's also missing the stock little gauges here there are 48 mil gauges and it's voltage it's water temp and i don't remember i haven't driven my gtr in a little while anyway different however this one is stock stock stock and that's what i like about the car and

that's why rates are so high the interior is immaculate and i forgot to talk about the specs it could solve for eight thousand two us dollars nineteen one model rp20 dt 3.5 grade cc really cool car would love to own one can't bring them in unfortunately they're not listed as collectors items moving on to our final one two three four five cars we are halfway there if you've made it halfway well done tiara super rzs meaning rzs means that it is in fact got the 2jz gte the turbocharged variant of the 2jz obviously this one however sold quite cheap a lot of the rs8s models go for i mean good condition ones go for 40k 50k 60k sometimes even touching on 70k i'm talking us dollars here this one

sold for 20 000 and you could probably figure out why when you see the third picture it has got a veil sidekick in the front it's got worki i don't know are these the wheels are they're the wheels i don't know wheels to all i know is what i've got it's got a trd something and um anyway that just looks the business crazy vented bonnet huge bell side wing on the back it's got some sort of drop suspension it's likely coilovers again aftermarket exhaust and i mean other than the front bump and everything else it's relatively stuck on the interior now you see why it's sold for twenty thousand dollars not a bad thing it has more than likely been sold off i would say to the states but it's 1997 so it'd be still quite a bit of a weight two years maybe it's going to storage who knows pull that out throw a manual and you've

got a right hand drive toyota supra with a 2jz native in this car pretty damn amazing to me it looks good it's clean comes a little dude inside too nice car look at that immaculate from what i can see on these really low image quality photos okay goodbye supra happy gc10 i am not gonna pronounce this because last time i got flamed i called it a hakusuka i think you're supposed to say hakuzuka correct me in the comments section uh 1972 model sold 56 000 us dollars five speed manual it's got the sr20 d it was an e i don't remember it's not a d e and it's not a dt but it is an sr20 or s20 it's an s20

(Start: 00:13:18)
that's the one it's an s20 r cc average inside outside this is a very old car um it had some repairs done to the bonnet and the back it's probably had a bit of a respray but it sold for about the same amount of money that you would have paid for that white or x7 that i showed previously this is a gorgeous car and there are as far as i know three in south africa one is owned by mr freak the who has a hundred i'd be lying to you now he's got a hundred plus nissans and destins listen and dances he's a madman obviously i don't know too much about these vehicles um i'm not gonna dive deep into it but you can see a couple of problems a little bit saggy so like the pins probably broken on there um pedals could use a little bit of refresher i don't know if there's supposed to be a panel here to tuck the wiring either way

(Start: 00:14:19)
damn someone was sitting on a gold mine 56 000 us dollars you guys can see the link up at the top if you want to take a closer look just type in that link i might not show you the price if you're not registered but there is the kpgc10 absolutely gorgeous i have a correction i've been saying c10 the entire time it's actually a kg c10 but it is a aku moving on two another fd type r sold 27 000 us dollars 2001 model 66 000 kilometers it's been resprayed repaired it's got an e exterior and a c interior i haven't looked through the pictures thoroughly but i'm assuming it's got a lot of rash oh my goodness all right these panels have

been repaired or replaced repair replacer xx means that and then there is just a ton of dents and scratches and paint blemishes you name it and the severity goes from one to five so they're mostly minor with regards to scratches and and dents and all that but [Music] not great but i mean the car sold for quite a bit of money but it is a later model and it does have low mileage i don't know if these dials have been clocked back or you never know because i mean sixty six thousand kilometers and you're getting a steering wheel that looks like that mine my two have got one has got a hundred and one thousand kilometers another one hundred and forty 1000 black one 141 and my steering wheels do not look like that the steering wheel from my mr2 sw 20 however does look like that but that car's got 210 000 kilometers i don't know

(Start: 00:16:23)
something seems dodgy to me [Music] seat's got a little bit of abuse as well i had that exact kenwood in in my silver one when it arrived or the black one i actually don't remember in one of the cars you've got the notorious saggy bumper in the front um for the price it was decent and i made it to the last because it was one of the better fds and i decided this time not to go and throw in the five thousand us dollars and six thousand because these are the best cars in my opinion of september 2020. something different tier starlet this is a gt variant this has i don't remember the engine code but it has caught its overcharged engine it is a 1300 and it's an r something's been repaired or redone more than likely this bonnet and there's a whole bunch of issues the dd so it's like below average like not so

great borderline not so great it is over manual 2 600 us dollars dirt cheap pocket rocket this one has got a couple mods nice steering wheel i'm going to say that's a momo momo drift could be a fake one it's got a boost gauge that likely a apexi white face gauge i don't know what seats these are from seeing at this angle but it looks it looks the business it's hiding there doesn't want to be in the picture but i mean these these are cool this is the ep 91 there's the seats they they look like cheap cheap seats oh there we go momo drift and i still don't know what goes that looks like an auto gauge or dragon or something cheap that i'm pretty sure is an apx it's got a cup holder because none of these cars came with cup holders uh that looks like a gritty trust probably a fake gritty trust getting up and it's got no radio in the car but it is dirt cheap

jumping into a turbocharged pocket rocket that not many people have at least here in south africa i don't know how many there are less than five i'm sure to the final vehicle that sold for fifteen thousand seven hundred us dollars this is a subaru impreza wrx str version five something that i always wanted i always always wanted a gca you all know that i've had a couple gc8s already i never had a two-door i would have loved the tudor and this one looks the business it looks to be stock that red heart is likely stock i don't think it's sitting on coilovers i think that a stock suspension the str suspension had the red strut and the red springs on it um all stock stock exhaust stock wheels stock i was gonna say bumper spoiler stock lights with the big wrx logo on it really really really cool it's got the dc cd over here it is a 5

speed manual and there's a dc cd switch by my steering wheel and then it's got a little intercooler spray button which is really cool and that is all stock standard features it's got a single turn radio and i'm not sure what that is but that is electronic electronic toll collection system nice and neat example that lot i'm assuming see here i see water spray i'm assuming that lot was it is off the market or set up for the insecure water spray but it's just an assumption on my part this is probably one of the coolest cars that i've shown tonight i'm just having an sti and i'm just having a gc8 especially a gc8 maybe maybe one day i'll find a cheap one because i'm a cheap ass girls and girls thank you so much for watching really appreciate it uh let me know if this camera angle is okay i see that the tower is flickering a little bit but um

we'll see we'll change it up for the next video that was that those were the best cars of september 2020 and i will see you all next month for another one of these videos peace [Music] you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be a pro don't waste your time no more who the are you to tell me what to do i don't give a damn if you say you disapprove i'm gonna make my move i'm gonna make it soon and i'll do it because that's what i wanna do cause all these opinions and all these positions they come in in millions they're blocking your vision but no you can't listen that is all fiction cause you hold the power as long as you're dreaming

Title: JDM Cars For Sale in SA - V12 Twin Turbo Lambo Style Mini Bus!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4uIvcsTp4

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to a brand new episode of cars for sale in south africa today is a very special one because i found something incredibly interesting it has a v12 it has twin turbos no it's not your average sports car that you'd find it is in fact a japanese minibus i found this is what you call a quantum so it's quite a bit bigger than a high ace a lot of people especially in japan know what a high ace is even in the uk and in australia this is a bigger version of that the quantum is what we have here this dude imported some crazy lambo lamborghini style body kit for this car he's got some massive wings we'll go through the spec list in a sec but just taking a look at these pictures by the way this ad has gone viral on gumtree which is ridiculous i was linked this by gareth when it was about 400 views and i've just been so busy having a chance to make this video luckily the advert's still on crazy looking car as you can see

(Start: 00:01:00)
unbelievable the dude once okay a little before i tell you the price here is the engine bay so obviously he's got a lot of room and this is sitting inside so i'm assuming you open the slidey door thing and then in front of you you've got a v12 with some crazy gorgeous custom pop work intake manifold all custom built turbo setup it i don't think it says in the ad what service there are but it's twin tip i mean look this is a work of art look at this thing that is underneath and i'm assuming this is in the front it's just everything is just done to the tee well see now this this is definitely inside this is in the cabin see here's the front wheel the front of the car is underneath yeah there we go i actually i haven't gone through the ad probably so i'm winging this see what the video that cut this open it must be flipping hot inside the cabin

(Start: 00:02:02)
i hope this dude's got air con imagine that heat i mean there's a turbo right there okay that's the hot side but still it's a little blanket i'm pretty sure it gets pretty damn hot anyway um big gearbox nice intake manifold everything in here that's crazy like no expense bed actually let me show you guys quick what um i know he's selling a stock standard quantum now this is what it originally looked like that that's the quantum these are very common here and then it became that that to that madness um price guy wants 1.2 million rand that's

(Start: 00:03:04)
like 90 000 us dollars around there quickly going through this it's got a v12 from a toyota it's a five liter it has two big turbos i don't think he says anywhere in that what turbos there are he's got uh bespoke intake like we mentioned it was very very done well that doesn't make sense it was done very well um he's got porsche 911 gt3 bosch injectors then he's got a tcr street fighter three speed auto box good for 750 horsepower madness anyway i've paused long enough you guys can read through the spec list on the sheet uh contact james if you're interested in this car i know nothing about the owner and whatnot uh here's the standard power figures of what a quantum quantum has this one is pushing way beyond that anyway this is uh not normal for the channel if this is the first time you joined us my name is nelson i do these random videos every now and again i also do diy in the garage with my very own r32 gtr i gotta think about this

(Start: 00:04:06)
two rx7s and an sw20 mr2 hit that subscribe button hit that like button for this video it'll help me out moving on right on away from the quantum on to not that quantum and we forgot something so another thing we do on this channel is we rate the cause of what we found this one because of its uniqueness because the ad is so well written and because there's pricing so i graded on pictures on the vehicle itself is the ad decent so if you just do a one liner and i don't know what the hell is going on in the car then i'll give you a pretty bad rating so i'm gonna bang this with an unusual 9 out of 10 because this ad is damn good right onto this zx i believe this one was imported legally by nissan themselves official nissan import 93 through toys nissan papers and all the letter seeds blah blah blah it is the soft top we often see a lot of

(Start: 00:05:10)
t-tops running around um i'm not sure i didn't read the ad property is it a twin turbo i don't know maybe there's an engine bay pick hey there's an ft in the background i never noticed that that's pretty cool damn okay um tires are running flat i don't know what sound it's it's a 300zx super cool car i don't know about the auto cabriolet is what you call it a cab it is stock standard with the cigarette burn in the seat or someone had a spark in the ass when they sat down 72 000 kilometers that's impressive anyway um i don't know not for me because in order because it is a cab and convertible that's what i was looking for pictures are like

(Start: 00:06:12)
kind of low raised but there is an ft in the background so i'm going to give this ad a 6 out of 10. moving right into the world of all-wheel drive two-liter turbo gca wrx or in south africa we call these the gt turbo models i sound like a broken record but i've had four of these in the past um gca it's between 1997 and 2000 and they're cool and now i've got a hell of a soft spot for them and i still want to get another one at some stage this one has a strange dumbbell set up here really big intake front mount intercooler stock radiator i don't know what else anyway big wings some ready livery he's got a towel for some reason [Music] don't know why uh front grill looks a little bit skewed running as normal probably fix that

(Start: 00:07:12)
quite easily big tachometer and some random gauges probably a boost gauge steering wheel would need to come out this wooden trim just no there's some lighting inside like okay cool um yeah that gear surround will come out i know that that was stuck at the time but that should come out auto stylish max motorsport flippin what you call them carpets not for me um look i would love to buy this car brandon but and i've already seen the asking price as well as a week or two ago 140 000 rand that is a lot of money for what you're getting uh there are a couple of others i understand this one's neat and it's different we've got wx wheels and what i mentioned in the engine bay um and a hood scoop but probably just there for aesthetics it looks like a little bit of a drop in the front anyway

(Start: 00:08:15)
like 90 90k ish there was a weird black and green one that sold for 40k last week i missed that at that ad i should have actually saved the pictures and brought it up here and then there's one for sale on olx right now that came up in the previous uh costs for sale in africa which is selling for 60k what not obviously not as good as conditioners this one anyway uh rating because of the carpets and the weird lighting and the skew thing and the trim six out of ten sorry 1984 280zx i love the car still want one i would love to throw an rb20 in it i'm looking for a cheap one and i will show you that i have been looking for a cheap one so if anybody knows that's watching this video please let me know i would love to throw the rb20 in here uh this car is listed as a z it's a zx um i don't know not much to say there's

(Start: 00:09:17)
it's a nice car i'm going to give this a again 6 out of ten now this one already you can see the the price it's an mr2 it's uh it's a base model so it'll have a base model g or g limited i might be getting the g wrong mine is a g limited i don't know what this one could be a property uh which is a 3s gt 3sge flat fins on the bonnet uh you can tell by the wheels and exhausts and rather than that it's clean so it's a 3sg it's normally aspirated 2 liter i have one of these in black and i love it i would love to buy this corner you're saying you're negotiable but if you're watching this i can do 50k and that's the only reason why i'm not phoning you because i don't feel like being a dick in one of those guys on the phone like hey can we do 50k do you think that's

(Start: 00:10:20)
possible no i'm not that guy so if you're watching this video off you know i'm off at 50k and um i'll take it off your hands but yeah i just don't want to be the dickens anyway not a lot of description on the ad um three pictures what can i say still a cool car but the ad is shoddy so again i think this is like the third or fourth rating six out of ten again here we go this is a 6010 knot the next car i'm not gonna give a rating because i did rate it in like four episodes ago this is down the road for me like literally down the road for me in i'm it is a veil side fd it's got a big v8 in it and dude wants to now consider a swap for something of similar value or equity so it doesn't have to be a car i had a dream i woke up and i told my wife about it and she like basically slapped me silly uh i was

(Start: 00:11:20)
thinking about phoning him and saying hey would you like to swap my 32 gtr for this but you know to replace my 32 gtr i'm going to spend a lot more than that uh he wanted 400k or 450k way back when i think the ad started up quite high like 700 anyway dropped like 400 or 450. so if you guys want to buy this car give them a shout as details are here that's on gumtree go take a look we're not waiting just bringing it up again the silica there's actually two of them guy wants a hefty asking price for two normally aspirated 3s ge models this one is an st 182 normally aspirated left hand drive now this is the st202 and that is some random porsche in the background dude's got a lot of land i'm jetty look these cars are neat or at least

(Start: 00:14:30)
but there's no phone number oh there's a phone number now guess what i'm doing after this video there's no pictures however it's just those two pictures and i was asking mr kevin i hope you will happen to have more pictures just to get the ball ready but that is cheap and that's like something that i could throw the rb20 in without spending a lot of money anyway a little bit bleak about this one um he replied a bit late so anyway i'll start this conversation with peter peter trust you're well uh blah blah blah is rx even still for sale how much he's selling it for it was an fb with a big single table much like that other one that i'll just show you that purple blue one the silver one the condition wasn't great but it had a 13b from an fd running on he said here it was on the microtech but then it was giving a problem so they moved to spatronic but that did not finish because of his health unfortunately and uh so he's selling or stripping for

Title: 4 Year Old PlastiDip : A Long-Term Look
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YcKqXATeZo

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up everybody and welcome back to the channel today i'm going to be showing you what plastidip looks like on a vehicle after four years so this is the first time you're joining me on this channel my name is nelson i have an r32 gtr uh two rx7s an mr2 and a lexus that never features an indie video this my friends is my 32 gtr with plasti dip coating it was originally spark silver about four years ago i decided let me do something that's not permanent something that looks cool something looks flashy cool in my opinion a lot of people don't like it and i went for this matte blue i can already see the haters in the comment section just tapping away what a color it's not even shiny it's matte it's whatever you know what i like it or at least i did like it i think i'm going to be pulling it off soon let me know in the comment section what you guys think anyway let's dive right into it if you're not subscribed hit that sub button smash that like button on the video really appreciate it it goes a long way let's take a look at the car we're going to stop in the most obvious place and that is the front end of the car there are a couple issues

(Start: 00:01:00)
and a few of them you can actually just see straight off the bat the bonnet is littered with scratches the specific coating that's on here is called liquid armor it's apparently the best of the best this was done by a company here in south africa they did a really good job applying it i mean they managed to cover every single piece of the car which is great but like i said these scratches here i account before i had a gardener that was working here and he thought it would be a great idea to pick up the uh welcome mat in the front of my door throw it onto the bonnet and sweep around he didn't just do it once i caught them doing it three times uh anyway that was that these scratches i actually have no idea but i'm assuming they are from using things like uh those sort of cloths to clean or dry perhaps a little bit of dirt on the chamois when you're drying or you know your usual cleaning application that you use in a vehicle

(Start: 00:02:01)
i mean if you look at the bonnet there are quite a few of these you don't see it so much when you take the cot out but we're searing it quite a bit because i have a lot of lighting inside the garage so for the most part it looks good it looks good from far when you get close up you start finding tiny little blemishes and when i say blemishes it's things like that like that these are not washing off yes the core is dirty but those don't come off i know what it is i've tried i've tried proper plasti double cleaning solution i've tried quite a few things and just like these stains they don't come off and they don't come off easily some of them have been coming off okay this this is dirt right here i was uh sorting out my shelving and i made a little bit of a mess inside so stains lots of stains all over the car they're tiny i mean you only really notice them if you get close up one other thing

(Start: 00:03:03)
is scuff marks little tear you can see there's silver coming right through there around the badge i mean everything looks still okay around the badge again these tiny little scratches but like i said you only really see it because i've got the extensive lighting on what you do see when you take the vehicle out and i'm filming in here on purpose you guys can actually see all the blemishes and all the issues around the edges all over the car especially on the top here you can see it's like i wouldn't say it's peeling kind of lifting i don't know what you'd actually call that but it's mostly around the edges where it meets it it did look fantastic it did look great you see what i mean it's it's actually it's not that bad for a four-year-old job so you can see on the interior it's actually still pretty neat it's not peeling nothing's going on here

(Start: 00:04:04)
again little scuff marks little scratches really negligible stuff if you take a look at the around the badge i mean that's that's still okay yeah another stain i don't know what this is it does not want to come out and then along the side of the vehicle dusty because i was driving it's pretty much the same you'll find the same tough scratches and all those blemishes like i mentioned and then you're going to find things like this things that actually move these are electronic i probably shouldn't be doing it by hand but as you can see because it moves it's been ripping itself to pieces so those of you that are og's the channel remember that this house this garage that i'm in when we bought this house three years ago plus minus i was renovating and this vehicle sat here in the open and also set in the cardboard for roughly about a year with no cover and uh it was pretty sad times because i lost focus on the cars i stopped vlogging

(Start: 00:05:05)
i stopped making videos and all i did was just renovate and focus on the on the house which was not a bad thing with regards to the house but i neglected the vehicle and i'm glad in a way it had plastic though because it to me i'm assuming it protected the paint underneath pretty sure it has we'll see when i pull this thing off but it uh sat without a cover and all of that and i didn't drive it at all full of cement dust and building dust and you name it i washed it every now and again but it just wasn't good enough and that likely contributed to a lot if not 90 of the scratches that are on the vehicle uh probably some of the peeling um but for the most part i mean you guys have seen it's actually really in decent condition and like i said because of the lighting you see all the blemishes and everything else a lot more they're a lot more prominent so that is my plastic dip i want you guys let me know in the comment section what you think i already know what the answer is going to be get that

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome back to the vlog i've got to clear up a little bit of confusion before we get into the video i posted a thumbnail and a video the previous one with me holding a big ass turbo and in fact this big ass whole set turbo the gtr was behind me so i kind of like took a photo like this and i was holding the turbo um everyone thought i'm doing big single server on the ulti as much as i'd love to i really just i can't financially right now because it's it's manifold it's everything i'm not even going through this you guys know what the story is and that server is called the fd if you guys didn't watch the video then you would have seen the thumbnail and you were thought thumbnails meant for this car but if you did watch the video know what the hell i'm talking about anyway just to clear that [ __ ] up uh what are we gonna do is we're gonna move the cars around now something funny see this turbo taba it's a it's a grady i've been i've been collecting turbo timers for a little while now i'm actually

(Start: 00:01:00)
i've got quite a few apexi units blitz full auto timers hks units and then obviously i got inside all of the cars except the mr2 anyway um that gritty one i plugged them all in i was busy testing them just for the for the fun of it i'm i'm making like a display board and uh i'm gonna have them on display board switches and i'm gonna have some old boost controllers that i've got and electronic boost controls from hks and that sort of stuff and some old gauges like blitz gauges whatever i've got up here blitz gauge gritty gauge pivot gauge just have them on like a display board so i can mess around i feel like looking at them hit the switch they'll come on and the greater unit plays music listen to that how cool is that it's like someone

(Start: 00:02:00)
mentioned an instagram comment it's like a 90's uh a 90's video game it really is anyway it's uh for lack of a better word you guys are going to learn some afrikaans if you're not from south africa it's pus windy outside if you don't know what that means ask in the comment section someone will tell you we're going to get this mr2 just over there by the lexus depending on charge there's a plug in the spare wheel let's see probably wondering why the the horn is off well i think the wires got tangled on the inside and when i came back home after my little drive on monday i just drove it around the block the flippin horn as i drove down my driver and i turned this way it just started heating

(Start: 00:03:01)
non-stop flipping ridiculous first instinct just ripped it out i've left it if i put it back it just hits i gotta i gotta open open this [ __ ] up figure out what's going on [Music] ni3sge sounds good yeah done something's definitely caught in here it's like i heard cables munching crunching okay there's definitely going to be a little bit of drama with black rx7 uh battery died like midway through lockdown what about three months ago battery's completely flat

(Start: 00:04:02)
i'm just going to jump off the silver one i forget i need the interior all right here we go oh try that again oh geez just not enough of course the [ __ ] thing starts when i put the camera on i've got a i've got a broken lead over here it doesn't come properly that was causing the issue

(Start: 00:05:10)
i mean this battery is good that was charged this one's completely stuck you guys probably can't hear me as directional market that battery on the rx-7 the blackberry is completely dead nothing i can do i've already changed the water i filled it up and whatever four years old i kind of feel like i'm i'm neglecting these cars i mean i am in a way discs are stuck um i definitely am in a way but i mean i bought them knowing that it's something for the future and something for me to mess around with in the future not really so much for the now uh i need to sort out one clamp at the bottom is leaking somewhat

(Start: 00:06:11)
and um obviously i want to put the silver afd in the garage i just need to finish the gtr also change the plugs real quick before we do that shortly damn this interior is neat you know honestly this fd stock standard and on the single table on the black one is what it is make sure all is good see that's why i left the hook on there okay let's do this i haven't started this in forever just knowing that the taper was uh shutting itself with the whole seal issue and all the oil coming out i

(Start: 00:07:13)
just haven't bought it started should makes me nervous let's go oops this is a [ __ ] animal just want to keep an eye on this a ted tear high

(Start: 00:08:13)
but i think that's because i haven't done the apexe pfc whatchamacallit the audled in so what i'm gonna do is just park this gosh [ __ ] i absolutely [ __ ] myself uh switch i'm pretty i didn't switch it off on camera i switched the car off and it just threw this massive explosion and it's obviously running a little bit while it's pig rich at the moment and uh unburnt fuel when it's exhausted and just [ __ ] through a fireball it was so cool anyway i said it's neat but there's still wires hanging and i haven't put that metal thing back on and it's everything is here i just need to kind of close everything up so i'm gonna push this car back a little that should be bit put the covers on and then start working on the gtr so i can get this into the garage yeah what's

(Start: 00:09:14)
up guys a couple days later got the r32 outside we're gonna move that into the garage now fd in the corner obviously because you saw that a few minutes ago it's like two or three days later after that previous thing actually just saw the rx-7 um i don't remember what i actually said or promised that i wasn't doing the video i think it was changed the spark plugs in the r32 i don't feel like doing that right now because uh formula drift is on it's round two and i'm keen to watch but i have been doing shops shelving shelving in the garage so i've got that shelf up there it's just random crap that i was throwing um this shelf was going wonky i put in a little tiny little bracket that i had and then this is new i've got a new shelf there so there's my drills my dremel and my tamiya rc car and spears karcher and that piece of [ __ ] shield buffer thing that's gone all funky um i mean i'll literally just finish now

(Start: 00:10:15)
i'm busy cleaning up uh we're gonna move the 32 into the garage so at least you get something no ribs it's a bit late i love [ __ ] hardy dog bird [ __ ] almost caught her uh yeah sexy red lights can you hear that it's a radiator fan let me switch it off the spruce cage i mean it wasn't a special make whoops there you can see it wasn't a special maker anymore it's not working

(Start: 00:11:17)
87 645 kilometers i bought this car in 2013 and it had 79 000 kilometers but 8k it's still super neat okay that belongs in the footwell because i've still got a loose wiring here because of the switch but the interior on this car is like neat oh can't wait to get this thing driving properly again that's such a cool car to drive and it makes all the right sounds i mean the fd makes some pretty sounds as well but this [ __ ] trying to put it in gear with my right hand

(Start: 00:12:18)
a little bit shitty this is another animal right now some people put a tennis ball here to mark where they're going i've written can you see gtr so i know when [Music] you can go off yes this is all right so i'm supposed to be putting the door there now what that means is the way i'm parked right now there's only that much space i'm just happy what i do

(Start: 00:13:24)
is i'll put my back into it now look at my space by the way if anybody wants to know that's a humidifier dehumidifier absorber thingy hmm i think i'm going to tidy up for like five more minutes get all my [ __ ] together here and then uh go inside have some dinner watch super super drift no formula drift superdrift is local in south africa formula drift cool thank you so much for watching we'll see you on the next one peace

Title: Japanese Car Auctions : Top Picks of August 2020
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38xPwryVSq0

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome back to a brand new video today we're going to be taking a look at the best jdm cars that i could find at the auctions during august 2020 all right so diving straight into it we've got this beautiful toyota supra it is an rzs meaning it is the twin turbo variant this car looks to be 100 stock standard it's in 1998 it has 19 000 kilometers which is absolutely nothing 3.5 grade which means it's just above average d exterior c interior d meaning it's could use a little bit of work with regards to touch-ups and whatnot if you take a look at this the sheet here i think perhaps i should do a how to desire for an auction sheet video sometime you guys let me know in the comments section but just taking a look at this auction sheet you can see a1 a is a scratch one two three one being light to medium three a large scratch w

(Start: 00:01:00)
is like a wave wavy paint work so it's more severe it's like medium top issues on this one b is something bent or pressed in so it's like it's almost like a dent basically but um something's been pushed in uh you'll usually find a u on here is a u2 that's a dent medium sized dead a3 that means there's a large scratch from the back but looking at the car it's sold for a very good amount of money 35 000 us dollars is not cheap stock wheels stock exhaust system for what i can see unfortunately there's no interior pictures but it is what it is it looks to be stock now looking at these these are superb they are value for money like you can't believe it's a super impressive type 3 or version 3 rather wrx sti this particular one sold for a mere two and a half thousand us dollars two

(Start: 00:02:00)
thousand four hundred dollars high mileage so be it you can rebuild i mean okay this particular one doesn't have an inspection meaning you go into this external lot if it switches on then you're lucky if not you're gonna take a gamble on this car and the car went on auction there was no real inspection a lot of people that sell their cars in japan might not go through the the the inspection process because they they feel that they might be wasting their money paying for an inspection or they know that there's something severely wrong with it and they'd rather just take a chance and just say the car has no inspection uh here's some pictures um see what the offer is then obviously they'll put a reserve down so i'm not going to spend too much time on this one because it doesn't have a full on auction sheet but it's sold for nothing which is cool right now here is a better one this is the two-door variant also a wrx

sti or w type r sti in particular it sold fourteen thousand it's also a high mileage two hundred three thousand this car is great as a 3.5 like i said it was above average c exterior c interior meaning it is just average it'll it'll have just the amount of the right amount rather of dents and scratches and and paint issues paint fade etc for for it's yeah and for the mileage and for what it is i think it's a great car for 14 000 it might be a little bit on the pricey side but it is a type r it is the two-door version it looks to be in stock form i'm just gonna double check that exhaust i think that's a modifier exhaust it looks just a little bit too big to be on this car however the wheels are stock standard the decals or delivery is stuck the wing is stuck the tenter stock now these cars had turned on the rear windows only the fronts didn't have tint

(Start: 00:04:03)
the steering wheel is not stock the seats are stuck and it's going to boost gauge on it seats got wear and tear the steering wheel's got wear and tear i mean it's an old car it comes with a free battery i'll see i saw an issue what is what is glowing on the dash there oh it's just petrol okay so these cars get shipped which is normal they get shipped with like little to no petrol and uh both my rx7s actually got stuck at the port when they they arrived coming off the ship and both of them ran out of fuel but i mean they were hungry buggers they they literally just run them completely dry whatever's in the reserve or actually less oh yes i found this ortek silvia s15 now i think it's just an ortek body kit um i

(Start: 00:05:04)
don't think it was actually one of the official altec s15s but i think they just kind of label it now r means that the car was a rebuild something was rebuilt in the car or modified so it could be body panels etc in this case it's body panels b exterior b interior means that it is really good if you look at this auction sheet it's got some minor scratches on it uh a u so that is a scratch and a dent okay um 104 000 kilometers it's it's still fresh it's got decent mileage um i cannot read japanese i'm assuming that the last real service was done in 2012 at 55 000 kilometers i don't know um but it's neat it's got a it's got a broad or i've only

(Start: 00:06:06)
called it bridge seat uh stock carpets and it's got some big gauges here three big gauges nice off the market steering wheel nice deep dish feel uh original key which is always great weird little trim on the door handle area i don't know if it really goes with the rest of the car but it is what it is i don't know what you call these luts i generally just call them lexa slots because the is-200 used to have these um could have done some spaces on the wheels and probably just thrown the original wing that came with the type r spec r either way it's a sylvia and i put it on the top of my list it sold for eleven thousand five hundred us dollars and there's a later model the 2002 it got discontinued in 2002 just some interest there

(Start: 00:07:08)
yes this v-spec i33 sold for 28 000 us dollars it's an r so there's something that's been repaired or rebuilt or modified bumpers in this case it looks like everything is fairly stock with regards to bumpers and and whatnot so something has been repaired and i don't know what um it's c grading it's got the issues here so there's there's x's on there and that means that it's a modified something is the front end different i don't know i'm actually not entirely sure but it's got some horrific tint in the back i mean that needs to be sorted out it's got some random stickers on it i'd actually love to know what these stickers have said it looks like an aftermarket exhaust it's definitely not the stock exhaust because it didn't come with like these little twin pops but um generally when you put it off the

(Start: 00:08:11)
market exhaust is like a big cannon that's that's a weird one he's got uh additional cigarette losses here because one wasn't enough um is it a gps unit nav possibly or maybe watching movies who knows i don't know what this white thing is he's got the stock steering wheel which is a good sign he's got the stock gear knob stock leather boots that's always a good one i can't tell if that's the standard key but the keychain says japan cup cuppa what oh that tent okay well i don't know i don't know what story is yeah good pasta i mean if you're in for the 43 and you want to fix her up this could be the one oh it's really

(Start: 00:09:12)
solid but you know what i mean probably gone to the states boom 1989 r32 gtr so this is like the first first first ones that came out obviously because it came out of 89. uh 22 000 us dollars at assault for 23 000 us dollars it's a average spec so three and it's dd which means the interior exterior is not so great and it requires some sort of repairs i mean from just looking at these little photos first of all the car is stuck this is why i chose it earlier it's got stock wheels and it's got stock exhaust this is probably why i demanded some decent money um regardless of having the crappy spec it's got fog lamps on it which is unusual but it's got stock front bumper stock rear stock steering wheel albeit screwed you can have that recovered i guess this one's actually got some fuel in the tank

(Start: 00:10:15)
and it's a big fuel tank so that's actually a decent amount of fuel that looks like just a half a tank good money uh i don't know oh yeah i'll see i'll see what they mean look it's a lot of money for a car like this a car being that old uh however there's potential and and almost every single one of them get modded anyway moving on i actually didn't open this um i opened this by mistake i mean uh 21 000 us dollars for this thing it's a 1994 so it's the last of the 32s again it's average spec there's no exterior rating i wonder why because i think this is not purple 3 or a copy of he's got that in one lip on the back uh he's got a weird exhaust it's like

(Start: 00:11:17)
big and then really small strange um fitment is tight tight i mean that's sitting super slow those look like 18s or 19s uh weird carpets and there's my carpets apparently with plating he's got a roll cage in the car missing the leather butcher uh strange gear knob i don't know what that is there's a huge gauge deep dish nadia i think it's a naughty he's got cup holders he's missing a piece here where the uh uh what he called windscreen wiper flaps are he's painted that's all gold the no he's destroyed the seats just to get the roll cage in he's painted the little he's painted the ignition thing gold why and that is a naughty steering wheel that's right torn seats makes me sad

(Start: 00:12:20)
makes me sad seeing these prices knowing how little i paid for my r32 and how good the condition of mine came with 79 000 kilometers my interior is super super clean there's a tiny little bubble on the dashboard my interior is neat neat neat i'm the one who's gone up and cocked the exterior by dinging in the front i mean i just scraped the paint i modified the engine bay the way i felt should be modified and i've thrown plastic up on the car that's what it is anyway each there and i guess maybe this dude really loved it and i did the wiper delete i hate the wiper delete but that's just me i'm not able to say that i really wish i could read japanese and i just don't have the time to learn huh all right you guys are probably looking at this and if you have not seen this

(Start: 00:13:20)
car before you're probably thinking what is that did it come from a late 80s early 90s batman movie no it did not this car funny enough is actually an s13 so this is essentially an s13 chassis they all came in automatics every single one of these and a company called mitsuhuka in japan basically built these cars and sold them as their own brand so let's just jump right into the interior picture you recognize it that's an s13 automatic that's a momo steering wheel of some sort has been de-badged and i don't know it's pretty crappy interior it's got a 3.5 so it's above average bb it's good for what it is but i don't know i i like i'll take one of these just to cruise around and like nobody knows what it is everybody will think oh you're driving a car from the 50s

(Start: 00:14:20)
no you're driving a car from 1996. it's pretty cool though i dig it it's got horns in the front and wheel on the side and that's cool it's all pretty cheap as well six nine i mean you could probably get like a 180 sx s13 not that you could import it in south africa but you could get a necessity for like 1500 us dollars in order maybe less anyway that's the matsuka and then this poor sad looking skyline let's start with the least sad pictures there's a tree growing inside look at that okay um so this this is actually a gtr r32 gtr i think it's a momo wheel it's got the moss buttons and all that yeah it's like super rusted brake disc

(Start: 00:15:21)
and then we've got this beautiful front end rb26 and that's pretty much all that's worth while in this car maybe the gearbox too definitely the gearbox although it is a little bit glossy uh a shame this looks like a really really horrible accident i'd love to know what actually happened here i'm pretty sure the driver walked away without an issue car probably smashed something in the front and then spun out or someone crashed into them in the back then you spun out at the front but i mean if you were in the market for a few spares here and there maybe doors side mirrors dashboard has been pretty much gusseted out um gearbox and engine it's worth more than that than the 4 000 us dollars that's why i thought i'd bring it up

(Start: 00:16:24)
and then we got a chaser because everybody loves a white chaser 16 238 us dollars uh it's 148 000 kilometers above average bc b being really good exterior c being average interior there's no interior picks unfortunately it's got a massive wing on the on the back and it's got an intercooler in the front visible front mount intercooler looks like a small one but it is there it's got a sunroof and a little pb exhaust it's a chaser chasers are cool look at this clean as a whistle okay there's a large scratch there but it is clean the wheels have got some issues the rest is negligible that's why i gave it a b grading and then my friends we run into a couple rotaries here this one being a type r sold fourteen thousand seven hundred us dollars and 96

(Start: 00:17:25)
so this is pre pre changes so this would be the old style ecu the rat's nest hadn't been sorted the twin turbos had didn't have upgraded wheels uh there were quite a few things that these didn't have that the 97s and up had but at the end of the day everybody's when i say everybody most people just rip up the twin turbo system go single server and make life easier that being said mine's still not running great um this one does look super cool obviously this this front bumper didn't belong to this particular model uh but it is on the car and it looks great it did would need a bit of a drop to actually suit the car wheels are strange nice exhaust really nice exhaust on that car love it steering wheel i don't know it's like a copy of a momo maybe the shape is there maybe there's

(Start: 00:18:26)
the horn got changed who knows it's got the cherry blossom carpets i've got this in the black rx-7 i've got this in the silver rx-7 neat love it this one rb bath has sold 14 000 us dollars again uh it had a rb rating and an rb meant that it was rebuilt really well with aftermarket parts so this bumper and probably the wing that didn't belong into this car a bit on the car rather here xx that means that has been changed or replaced with something else so here xx there's the wing it means that it's been replaced if you didn't know that you learned something tonight huge cup holder and that's that's you know um that drink the gallo 24 that fits in there that's the one that's the cup holder you need for it another momo this is a momo race wheel this is

(Start: 00:19:29)
what i have an l32 gtr i love this wheel it's old and it's mine that's why i love it um i don't know i don't know what to say it's an fd it's got a big doubled in radio it's got a nice rounded gear knob thingy and it's yellow adam lz would appreciate this ah this one 26 or 27 000 us dollars it's above average cb uh he's got work wheels on it he's got a rocket bunny kit and that's why i open it because it's got a rocket bunny kit on it now i'm not a particular fan of the rocket bunny and it took me a while to grow onto the vale side now the veil side i absolutely adore now not because of han and all that fast and furious but because i don't have one and i want one now the rocket bunny kit i don't know a lot of people like it i

(Start: 00:20:29)
don't i don't think it's for me but it was cool and it sold for 27 000 us dollars almost i don't know what steering wheel this is um it's got a double dent it's got a weird weird weird gear shifter it sort of looks like it's got sort of some hydraulic system on it uh defeat gauges gage and uh there's some more picks of it and a blurry interior pick from the another strange angle i don't know i wouldn't spend that much money on something like that another subaru i don't know why i opened so many subaru's but this one sold for 4 000 us dollars and had 60 000 on the clock again no inspection don't know if it's running head gaskets are probably blown um it's got a whole host of gauges i don't know why this was done it could have been pushed up around the side here

(Start: 00:21:29)
yes i'm talking from experience i have done this before because i had three four of these gc8s the electronic toll collection system fell down the double sided tap didn't hold on it's gonna make my steering wheel and then it's got three other gauges i think these are diffie-wide face guys gauges because there is a controller over here i don't know what type of radio this is but i see an hks evc2 or three could be a three i think it's actually a four and that is not daffy i stand to be corrected but that looks like it could be some sort of airflow controller and that is just an old-school subaru radio with a tape deck thing and it's got red seat belt and some fish in the back i don't know it looks

(Start: 00:22:31)
like trout fish to me lost car and that is i don't know if we're saving the base for the last but this is the mazda a z1 kai car k-car key car don't know how you pronounce it eight thousand eight hundred and seventy-six us dollars is 1994 spec again i'm coming up with all of these it's a 3.5 rating and it's a cc so it's it's just average all around something's been changed in the front here i don't know what i'm not too familiar with these cars it could be this front end um big gaping hole there i don't know possibly an aftermarket steering wheel i don't know these cars very well i know they are super cool and there's a flare and i actually have two of these flares in my garage i was thinking about lighting them up but they'll probably blow my hand off they can just sit there how cool is that so the the radios and the controls don't sit horizontally they go vertically on this i like it i would love one of these because it's it's super rare i'll say super a lot but

(Start: 00:23:34)
it is it's super rare and it says auto zom on the back i'd love one anyway that is it for the video i know there were no mitsubishi evos or gtos but i just didn't want to cram too much into one i'm gonna do one of these every month at month end get that out there you guys can take a look let me know what you think about the video let me know what you think about the cars which one was your favorite be sure to hit that subscribe button hit that like button for me it really helps out the channel and i will see you all in the next one peace

Title: TommyFyeah fixed my RB Engine Stand Problem
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHV9TymKQuA

(Start: 00:00:00)
what is up guys and welcome back to a brand new video yes i've got a cap yes it's got my merchandise or logos all over it i don't know quite if i want to actually sell these i just i just made one for myself actually i made two let me know in the comment section some interest maybe we should do it maybe not i do however have some stickers and there is a competition running on my instagram where you could win some of these stickers so this is a new brand that i'm working on this is jdm junkie this little dude injecting some jdm goodness into his arm that's jdm donkey i'm giving away some of my old stickers because now calgary and i'm giving away the godzilla hand coming through the logo type thing anyway excuse the mess i'm busy working on something back to the title of the video why you actually came here right you'll remember i had issues with the jack not the jack the engine stand trying to hold up the rb20 yes it's a heavy engine but i had issues with the thousand pound

(Start: 00:01:02)
and the 750 pound engine stand i put them both the test they both failed horribly i did however find a video on tommy efia's page yes the god himself of all jdm goodness tommy effia has the exact engine stand this is where we left off last night terrifying but today is tuesday and he got his to work right so as you can see here's the engine stand all looking fine it's uh it's actually level at the moment it's kind of leaning a little bit to the right how i fix this is he gave me the idea in his video as you can see he's got issues with his his was sagging uh what was his words exactly about your faces god that's so nice before it would literally sag down four inches i'd say it'd be like now it looks pretty level does it look level yeah it does yeah

(Start: 00:02:03)
so it was sagging what did he do he welded on a freaking jack the exact jacks that i have here right those guys down there now the problem with that is you can't have an issue where it's going to always be mounted on the looks like there's something on my nose but there's not it's just the never mind it's always going to be mounted on the engine stand that means when you get to the point let's say the head comes off and you actually want to turn the block so you can start working in from the sump side you're not going to be able to knock it um i was going to do that and then i spoke to my old man who's betrayed a uh fitter and turner mechanical engineer he's like very clever up here unless it comes down to computers um i told him about the idea and he's like no he doesn't even want to listen um he's got a better idea yes

(Start: 00:03:05)
he appreciates that that was a rush and they needed it then but he's gonna make something cool for me and this is what he did i told him at 10 pm in the evening and all he asked for was the thickness of this over there and then the heart from here to the sump now what he did is he made this plate and i've got bolts that are running that way across holding it in and then i've taken the scissor jack from the nissan skyline and i'm just going to pick up another scissor jack off wherever actually autozone or something and the scissor jack is now bolted onto this so i mean this is not going anywhere i've got these two because the the sump is obviously uh not level and it's propped it up very very very nicely and it's working perfectly and it's it's fully level so the pen comes out at ease now you can turn it obviously i'm not going to turn off the jack on

(Start: 00:04:06)
but that solved that issue i mean if you all remember this thing was sagging like what did mixer an 87 year old grandmother who's breast fed 13 children i think that's what he said make because places you can go for that sort of stuff anyway that means that we can get cracking properly on this rb20 i'm probably going to start working on it in the next day or two i'm going to come in for an evening we're going to try and pull as much apart from the head as we can and then hopefully lift the head up um that being said i need to organize my garage first and it's it's one hell of a mess here for good reason one i've got a well it was my daughter's bookshelf that uh we started primering we're gonna paint but that's another story that's now in the garage and she got something way way cooler because we didn't like this um this is here now i'm going to start putting stuff getting rid of all this junk that's on here because it shouldn't be put up another shelf that was done today

(Start: 00:05:06)
i have another piece of what he called mezzanine melon scarlet fell for mel melamin something like that that's going to go up there and then i'm going to put stuff like the pressure washer and those empty bottles that i use for petrol and whatnot and then rearrange all my my goodies like up there stuff that i never touch hiv lives like everything is sealed except for that when that one everything else is sealed and then up here i've got all this goodness if you haven't already seen oh and i've got boom it's got lots all right so what do we got up here if you guys haven't seen this just for interest like there's a little controller for light so i got a remote control for it this little rx7 fd up there uh there is an hks evc 5 inside that box full complete there is an empty box am wide band gauges that i never ended up using i'll

(Start: 00:06:08)
use for project cop blood stump valve tamiya fuel pressure regulator that's actually in the box that's a gritty twin intake to single servo some hps filters an empty sparkle box uh some hks insects some apexi what do you call them super intakes a cheap helmet a blitz radiator cap and mr2 steering wheel a skyline police car one two three four five turbo timers and a pivot vault stabilizer uh a86 gt roll call i think uh rx-7 steering wheel and the fastest 2-liter award thing back in the day r32 ecu fd3s ec because i've got apexy power f season there i do have my old camera set up on a jack stand this is one hell of a mess that i'm busy sorting out inside this box i've got all the bits for this engine plus the intake sitting on the top all needs to clean up uh those things

(Start: 00:07:10)
are going to come off rb20 over here another plate plus quarterback covers and all that are getting sprayed with that rustoleum stuff but that's not the actual color that you see on the label it is oil brushed some it's kind of like millennium jade but for the cheap ass like like me anyway that's the garage that's what's happening in the garage uh gtr well what i'm going to do i need to throw on some clamps i have a leak and i've got some bunch of clamps that i'm throwing on the radiator um i was using some crappy clamps i actually don't have i'll chuck them already they kind of look like this but there's a bolt over here and it's the ones that came with the car originally and i think they're kind of just like old and worn and you know been over

(Start: 00:08:10)
tightened during the years and i'll put them back on and it's leaking on the both parts the bottom part and the top part so i've got some new clamps on you throw those on and then i'm done i can start taking the car out a little bit i've still got that crappy electric fan on that uh well we'll see how it goes but i'm likely gonna go back to the viscose but a gk tech or whatever old tangles lets me know about um what else i got 10 spark plugs that's for the gtr uh no not all 10 but six are going to go in the gtr and i'll probably gap them i don't know those are the copper ones probably get them but like 0.1 mil because they're all 1.1 but they should still be fine for what i'm running i'm only on about 400 horsepower anyway um then we good then i want to get this car out of the garage and i want to bring the silver rx-7 back in here because i have

(Start: 00:09:11)
some exciting news and it rhymes with kohlset you figure it out let me know in the comments if you figured out if you didn't then there's something wrong with you uh no there's actually something wrong with me that is pretty much it for the video uh how long ago i'm recording now 9 minutes 44 seconds that should be enough to give me a 10 minute mark to load a whole bunch of ads but no i'm just kidding because now they're doing eight minutes so we good don't make any money on these damn videos i make like a dollar if even if i'm lucky that is it for the video thank you so so much for watching i really really do appreciate the support let me know about the caps um stickers i don't know i don't know if you guys want to buy my merch just let me know i think the new one's quite cool at jdm junkie i've actually got a cap that i made of the jdm junkie logo you know this one i'll show you in the beginning of the video in here and then i've got the whole nail car thing on the back

(Start: 00:10:12)

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome back to the channel this is season two episode three of jdm cars for sale in south africa now i know it's been a little while since i've been posting these type of videos things have been hectic on my side let's see my last video was posted on the well three months ago what happened three months ago i had a kid it's been tough anyway i'm back sort of doing a little daytime filming here my daughter's playing in a room so i figured i'll capitalize on this whole thing so no swearing whatsoever in this video if this is the first time you're joining i'm going to be running through a bunch of calls that i found for sale on websites like olx gumtree and junk mail i'm going to be giving them ratings out of 10 and i'm basing the ratings on how i personally feel about the car interior exterior how i feel about the ad as well so if there's only one picture or if the picture was taken with a potato you know i might rate it like a three out of ten um just bear in mind these ratings are not it's what i feel it's it's not a reflection on the car everybody has their car to be

(Start: 00:01:01)
their own and they've built it to be their own just take it with a pinch of salt let's get right into it this first one harold's 200 sx s14 now this guy actually ended up buying the intercooler that's in my fd now the one that i've turned into v-mount it came from him in cape town it was silver at the time and had some weird black spray paint underneath it i obviously sprayed it gold it looks cool now uh this car's been safe selling for a little while now i have seen it before and he's included a video i didn't know there was a video okay i would have loved to own this car it's just locked down quarantined i'm not spending money okay the video doesn't work anyway he's got quite a list of mods and some really tasty stuff one being the sr20dt he's got a nice garrett turbo on it the usuals nice intercooler aop head studs boost controller uni chop this is a

piggyback ecu it's like a no-go for me got a bunch of other stuff that you guys can read through um but he reckons it's one of the cleanest in africa and you know to be honest price not negotiable the price is good 120 000 around us dollars this will be the one and only time i'm gonna give a us dollar amount because it's a mission seven thousand us dollars it's good money well i mean it's it's a lot of money but you get a lot of car anyway harold if you're watching this i love your car i wish i was allowed to buy it the watch says no going to give you an 8 out of 10. moving right on to another 2008 now remember i open up these ads like during the course of a few days and i leave them open i've got multiple

(Start: 00:03:04)
google chrome tabs that i'm actually working with and uh i find these cars and i forget about them and anyway here they are this s14 has a weird big ass bumper i don't know if it suits the car much i think it's missing a seat i don't know what's going on here um but anyway sparkle wheels missing the horn i could have done the vacuum before anything that sounds really neat mishimoto radiator got the stock shroud obviously got the viscous fat on still that looks like one of those little vacuum tube mounty thingies just to allow for extra vacuum instead of plug into the head or the block or wherever you go uh decently sized turbo that looks like a t3 t4 generic type turbo you still got a map sensor on the car well failed i don't know what make that is

(Start: 00:04:04)
it looks alright i don't think that rear bumper and the skirts suit the front end because the front end still got the stock see this is a different front but this is a different rear bumper and no skirts i don't know what the front's got in this picture so let's go uh daily race car on the road lots of extras clutch headers down apart boost pipes top mount turbo wastegate or brand new cool but i don't know what makes it in there uh lots of engine parts besides forged rods i mean so be it it's an sl20 uh car doesn't need touch up this is not a show car nothing major seat is out and being reupholstered that explains the missing seat because on instagram captains in think i i'm gonna follow you later 130k don't know if it's negotiable swaps with the same sentiment now anyway 130 grand i don't know the picture's on fantastic

there's no picture of the front of the car there's not a lot of info on there and with regards to actual modifications what type of modification what makes that sort of stuff i gotta go with the 6.5 but i do like your car oh this bad boy this has been on the channel before so we're not going to spend too much time on it i'll just quickly click through the pictures he's got 10 edfs he's got an old school this is a evc3 as far as i remember boost controller huge huge huge gauge it looks like a pivot gauge the sun's shining on a quantum detail cape town car big ass single turbo conversion you still got the whiskers fan with a really big hefty radiator which looks like the same one that i've got in my car to be honest

(Start: 00:06:06)
um anyway that's that the reason why i'm bringing this up oh it's got a healthy ecu is because it was a price drop this used to be 560 i think it actually started 600 and then 550 now is 520 and there is another price drop that has come up lockdown is bringing out all the cars and it's such a pity that i haven't been very active because i've missed so many cars for sale and i wanted to to show you guys all these cars so what i'm going to start doing now if you're not following me already go follow me on instagram at nail cal jdm i'm going to start posting these cards for sale in my stories i did it today i found a really cool super we're going to touch base with that soon go follow me on instagram you're going to start seeing them for sale maybe you'll pick up these ads before you even find them yourself in gumtree or overlex or junkmail or troubled cars anyway moving on haha oh god

(Start: 00:07:09)
i gotta go back so i've already done this car before and i'm just to give you a rating now and it's going to be an 8.5 this one old school silica gtr they call them 2 liter this has a 3s gt and i was taking a look at this ad the other day and i actually had a friend that sent me this as well and there's not much info with regards to the ad itself but it's got a third gen 3s gte so it more than likely came from a caldena um it's a weird weird weird shape and this this wing on the back it looks like it's molded onto the bootlet it i don't know it doesn't i don't know what to say it doesn't do the cord justice plus the smoked lots de-badged people look at it and what is it portuguese owner i don't know i don't know the smoke dot look doesn't do a nice drop on the coilies uh there's a 3s gte

(Start: 00:08:11)
it looks like a ct 28 or ct 20b turbo xl dumb valve generic stuff fuel pressure regulator that's a d1 spec oil catch can a little drippy thingy i don't know fernanda good luck with the sail you put some decent effort into the pictures um description yeah the car itself i don't know it's not to my liking like i mentioned in the beginning double don't get upset with me don't flame me but it's not my liking i'm gonna give this a 5.5 because i feel bad because portuguese so am i moving right on i was just talking about a price drop this is it this car was i'll be lying if i said i think it was 700 or 600 or 650 i don't know we've seen it

(Start: 00:09:12)
before i'm actually not going to give us the rating out of it yeah because it's been on the channel before to really go to rating i'm worried that i'll give it the wrong rating what i gave it last time just fyi it's here it's price dropped haha this is the one i post on instagram this is what i was saying to you guys this is cheap 250k for a supra it's an order though and it's a ge it's unfortunate and it's got some strange front bump on it um but it is for sale and it looks like it's sa registered because of that there's a disc on the front there's a license disk okay so it could be so registered 154 thousand kilometers carve your dreams well i mean like a crossover between a nightmare and a dream then maybe i'll take an auto ge but okay it's a supra uh

(Start: 00:10:13)
81 views already i'd post this on instagram hopefully get some traffic hopefully someone buys it i showed my wife i got shot down horribly i said look this is quite a deal here you could potentially drop in a gte plus box let's say i mean there's a there's a gte at the moment for sale for 45k on guntree like a silver one i think it's a joburg but they mostly go for around 60k so let's call it 60k plus a box another 25. let's say maximum yeah 485 90k that's 330 340 000 round sell it make a profit buy something else or keep it and you've got a supra anyway i'm bleak that it's an order and oblique that is a ge i'm also blink that i'm not allowed buying it so i'm going to rate you oh and the pictures are shite this is why i'm rating it so low what is that and that

(Start: 00:11:17)
and that six out of ten oh [ __ ] okay this ad actually had two cars in it when it first started out this guy here i found this ad 30 something minutes after it was posted because i was busy looking for rb26 stuff and i saw this for sale the other day and i was like okay cool what else do you have for sale clicked on them and this ad popped up and it was like so when was it six days ago it was 37 minutes old and there were two cars on this ad one being an r32 gtr with these stickers west london all over the car and some big numbers and looked like a gran turismo type sticker delivery set and i know this car doesn't have any paperwork from what i've heard and it's a really chassis no engine no

(Start: 00:12:18)
gearbox no diff so if you take a look it's missing everything dude wants 30 000 for this the other one i had my buddy um pingham and he wanted 55k for the other one now i assumed because this car had no paperwork that the other one didn't either it sold for 55 000 rand but i said i wouldn't do it but i'm gonna do it how much is that in dollars that is three thousand us dollars with papers the papers alone are worth the money okay no diff no gearbox no engine on the other one either but it had papers and i told my wife by the way she says yeah for that money i mean you can whatever but it's got it's missing parts obviously i'm upset and for that fact

(Start: 00:13:20)
i'm rating this advert a seven i don't know why i said it wasn't meant to be i wonder who bought it if if you're watching this and you bought the car please ping me say hi tell me what you're doing with it i heard this thing do you install it it's it's like nothing special whatever it's a little hatchback it's a 1.3 liter it's the sl sl version it's really really nothing special but it's a style it's automatic i thought i'd just show this it was a jdm car after all we didn't get them um so this was obviously brought in from overseas and registered i'm going gotta give it like a four out of ten because it's not the starlet that i was actually looking for oh damn yes okay this car pictures on opening um come on alex it's not the first time you've done this to me

(Start: 00:14:21)
while filming anyway you guys can see the little pictures he wants 240 000 around it's quite hefty for what it is because it's got a big v8 in it it's an ls2 conversion uh it's got some ton henson motorsport subframe on it i believe that's decent so it's not a backyard subframe that was made all papers in order serious buyers and contact me for viewing it's pretty we can't can't see this damn picture anyway it's got 130 000 kilometers doesn't matter anymore because it's got a different engine in it and it's an fd at the end of the day and he's got the nice swing he's got the same wing that that i've got on both the fd's which i like the stock stock front bumper the same bumpers both my fds again sagging from barbara same like my fts cool i like it i don't know so much about the v8 swap but i have always said if i pop the rotary in my car i'll do a swap and it'll probably be a 1j or i was going to say this

(Start: 00:15:22)
i'll be 20 i don't know maybe is the story uh 240k give you a 7 out of 10. supra 130 000 red like what was so cheap because it's a cut let's just just let's look at this for a minute it's been chopped up and got some weird steering wheel cover and it's got a gauge and bad look out of this car i don't know it's pretty much stock other than the intake on it and whatever this is this looks it's just the grounding kit that's all it's just the grounding kit and then this i don't know probably a hrd kit other than that it's dark stock stock it's cool it's here it's local it's 130 000 round i don't know if it's worth

(Start: 00:16:23)
buying because i mean the only thing that you're really going to get out of this is the assembly here would you really even use the stock brake discs and calipers and all that stuff like no all you want is the engine ready maybe you had a front smash maybe you want this i don't know i'm not gonna rate it we'll move on ah this has been on the channel before and the price has dropped slightly this is the only reason i'm mentioning it i'm going to do this from time to time with a fun cards and i remember because i don't write this [ __ ] down if the prices have dropped i will show you prices dropped i don't remember what the price was it was 100 or 95 it has dropped it's clean it's nice i like it i want it i'm just showing this i'm not going gonna give this thing a rating it's a crash fto it's jdm it's yeah local in south africa i feel bad

(Start: 00:17:24)
for it i don't know what the hell happened there but uh hopefully whoever was driving it was okay and let's drop me out for space uh this one i actually never ended up looking at the ad so this is an fb 95k some generic steering wheel um looks like he's got a garmin in place there so weird that is a weird engine it looks like a 1600 no what is that if e3 is whoops if e3 is okay i don't know it looks like um it could be a two liter tv that's over i don't know much about

(Start: 00:18:25)
this engine but it doesn't matter the branded engine i mean this thing probably goes it weighs nothing uh you'd like to swap for a polar tdr corsa dti or a small bucky a buck here's a truck if you're not watching from africa um ninety five thousand i think it's a bit hefty for what it is six five point five five four five out of ten this thing oh gosh this is the st202 it's not a st205 and uh it's got a couple of things on it it's a one it does have a 3s i'm assuming it's a ge that's been turbocharged it could be a gt however it's an automatic weird looking seats it is a silly color but i don't know is it even sa registered does the advert doesn't say

(Start: 00:19:26)
but it's been turbocharged it's got rust on the wastegate it's going to rest on the water pumps it's an auto and it's not a st205 i'm gonna give you a four and a half out of ten ah the rest of wagons except for one i'm pretty sure this has been on the channel i don't remember the price though but there is no price on this one but it's uh it's an evo 9 wagon i'm not going to give it a rating i'm pretty sure it was in the last video this one however is super cool if i didn't have the lexus actually i'll probably still keep the legs this is quite an old car but this would be a cool family car i'll probably pop the suspension up slightly higher but i get it it's got that whole euro vibe i don't even know maybe does you say euro or something on here nah anyway let's take a look at the ad

(Start: 00:20:27)
it's quite a lengthy one um it's been for sale for about two weeks now i think it looks pretty cool there's only two photos though i wish you all the best of the sale i like your car i'm gonna give you a seven out of ten this one the only reason it's here is it's got the same engine from a subaru wrx so it's an old spec one so it's 169 kilowatts 165 kilowatts it's an ej20 turbo and i mean these things go they're super capable vehicles one day they they're quick two they can climb [ __ ] which shouldn't be swearing clam stuff so that's that's a subaru forester the only reason i put it on here is because this is damn cheap and this is steel look how clean that boot area is all the best sale i like it i probably won't buy one because it's so old but uh i mean old for like a daily

(Start: 00:21:28)
6 out of 10. the last and final car this one is nearby to me kind of he's about 10 k's 10 kilometers away from me and it's a gt turbo what we call them gt turbos but they essentially gc8 wrxs i thought we had the australian spec which was also called gt turbo as far as i know and this this was a jdm spec i'm not sure how it got sa registered here probably returning resident or something but we didn't have interiors like this on our our jd our gt turbo specs anyway he's got some sort of a drop on the car i don't know if it's springs or coilovers um going back to the engine bay it looks pretty much stuck other than these pops they're probably pierced and you have to replace them and i don't know why this is breathing to atmosphere that looks like the stock downfall but it's breathing to atmosphere

(Start: 00:22:30)
it's got a manual boost controller so there it does have a mod i don't know what turbo it's got in there no sort of exhaust and it's got a radiator off the market radiator i'm missing one radiator mount bracket thingy mob and it's got an str badge so it's 10 kilowatts quicker uh cool car not so great price i would love another one i've had four of these these like particular ones all of them blue no i had one silver one three blue one silver that's it i'd love to own it but 70k is a bit of a reach please no time waste is not an urgent cell anyway that's it for the video some decent cause for sale there have been a lot more cars that i've missed and i'm still crying about but um thank you so much for watching if you find cars on facebook i don't have facebook or if you have them on whatsapp groups ping me on instagram show me the cause i'll make more videos like this let me know i forgot to give this car rating i'm gonna give this thing

(Start: 00:23:32)
six out of ten that is it for the video thank you so much for watching i'll see you all next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be a pro don't waste your time no more who the [ __ ] are you to tell me what to do i don't give a damn if you say you disapprove i'm gonna make my move i'm gonna make it soon and i'll do it cause it's what i wanna [ __ ] do cause all these opinions and all these positions they come in in millions they're blocking your vision but no you can't listen that [ __ ] is all fiction cause you hold the power as long as you're dreaming

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome back to a brand new video i've got a couple things to tell you one of which is the rb20 what's been going on with it well i filmed a video i just i wasn't happy posting this video because it was just me working i don't know if you guys want to see it i mean i can throw it out there if you really want to please ignore my haircut it was my attempt but anyway this is what it's looking like at the moment i still need to do a little bit of work pull the main caps off get the get the shafts out start working my way down pull the head off and then tackle the block i did a live stream a couple days ago and i'm actually doing one again tonight this video will probably be posted tomorrow and i did a live stream and i had i had a couple guys donate to me and i've actually spent their money and they donated to me um for the sake of being censored so i went on a little bit of a swearing

(Start: 00:01:00)
rant i had a bad day and uh i mean my true colors kind of came out i i generally don't swear on these videos because i know the the audience might be a little bit greater than on a live stream and i don't want children and whatnot to be privy to my my english that being said thank you so so much i'm genuinely thankful to the mick he was the first to to send me my first ever super chat um the godzilla godzilla if you guys don't know godzilla where have you been hiding he was my inspiration to start up a youtube channel not an inspiration to get this thing i already had this but inspiration started the channel so thank you and jacques and johannesburg he's i've mentioned before in the vlog he's going to be helping me with his engine build um he's going to be advising me on what to do and how to do things and

(Start: 00:02:01)
super super sharp he's watching this video hopefully he's watching right now dude thank you so much all three of you guys i mentioned thank you so much if you guys want to support the channel you can do donos in some way i think i got a donut page on my description there might be now otherwise jump on the live stream and come help me out everything goes towards the cars uh especially during this lockdown now and we're still under lockdown in south africa and um things are tight at the moment and i'm not really spending on the cars so guys you help me that being said we will be opening that package now right so we have a box bosch relay i don't know if you guys ever watched that one rx7 video where i didn't have a holder and i started running the wires directly to this that was dodgy i bought a holder for it that will go on there and then i can wire this up nice and neat this is exactly what i'm going to be doing i'm going to be using this for the relay

(Start: 00:03:02)
or fan relay setup on the rx-7 i had major issues trying to buy this stuff overseas i placed two ebay orders and i had them both cancelled annoying um they were shipping from china and then they just turned around and said sorry no anyway i've got some little crocodile camps because those are handy to have i've got an inline fuse that takes a standard size fuse or one of these see one of those fuses then i got these ditch connectors and they're good i've got another one of those holders i got an inline fuse holder another one for a small top fuse there's a usb port this is gonna get wired up in the mr2 because i'm working on a on a retrofit gps nav thing for the for the mr2 which is exciting some heat shrink and some heat shrink this stuff

(Start: 00:04:04)
is going to go on this car soon i've got to skip a couple days here i actually ended up setting up this relay for the electric fan now hear me out i'm about to get someone in the comments called tangles01 awesome youtuber he's got an r32 gtst with the rb25 swap he built it himself he also got a ford falcon va or something or other um he's about to comment and say how crappy this install is i need to burn it and i need to put in a gk tech van yes i know i don't have the funds right now kind of like saving my money in case something happens during this lockdown coronavirus story um plus also i'm not really leaving the house anyway i kind of just need this only to get out to a petrol station so i can pump the in my tires so they don't go fully flat and ruin them completely um i have looked at the gk tech i'll probably end up getting it in the future

(Start: 00:05:05)
anyway i have done the setup already and i followed i followed this guide over here i mean it's it's pretty simple stuff i'll show you guys exactly what i kind of just drew my own out with with the colors then basically everything that you see here with a manual override switch and i'll show you how that works in a sec let's take a look at the engine bay look how dirty this car is it's been here for three days we had like a crazy ass windstorm um i cut the grass like two or three days prior and yeah it's now full of but the garage kind of occupied the prison if you guys haven't watched the previous video let's take a look at that with two engine stands sitting nice and pretty sort of oh damn you bird [Music] all right here we go okay this is a hell

(Start: 00:06:06)
of a mess um i kind of just left it on purpose like this so that i could show you guys and then i'm gonna be neatening it up but again it's just it's gonna be here for a little while but you know i'm not gonna drop the comet at all actually just to get some air in the tires i've got my bosch relay here with this really cool relay holder which the only one that i'm not using is this red one i was i was thinking about setting up an led on here i've changed my mind everything's got heat shrink on it here's the fuse running to my 12 volt my battery's been relocated to the rear and the fan works so that that just needs to need one of those cover things sheath i don't know i've got them in the garage and then on this side it works on ignition i pulled all the support around the ignition nice and neat that's the ground this also needs to be tidied up i'm not going to mount that thing anyway

(Start: 00:07:10)
but here's how it works i hope there's a lot of sunlight out there okay causing ignition [Music] and this is it just see simple fan comes on don't want it on anymore grab a switch simple as that it's a really cool way to set this thing up if you guys want to just pause on that and you can you can use it i just found it off google but i need to get one of these thermo switches and run that onto the radiator something that goes like 79 degrees all right guys that's it for the video thank you so much for watching see you later

(Start: 00:08:10)
peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be a pro don't waste your time no more who the  are you to tell me what to do i don't give a damn if you say you disapprove i'm gonna make my move i'm gonna make it soon and i'll do it because that's what i wanna do cause all these opinions and all these positions they come in in millions they blocking your vision but no you can't listen that is all fiction cause you hold the power as long as you're dreaming

Title: 750Lbs vs 1000Lbs Engine Stand - RB20 6 Cylinder Stand Fail
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skQ0ERYDIHU

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to a brand new video today's video we're going to be testing a 750 pound engine stand versus the 1 000 pound if this is the first time tuning in my name is nelson i run this channel i have an r32 gtr and rx7 mr2 and i'm starting to work on engines if you're not subscribed be sure to hit that subscribe button smash the like button as well thank you so you guys are probably wondering what the contraption was behind me well it's a scaffolding setup i'm trying not to leave the house during this whole lockdown quarantine coronavirus whatever you want to call it and uh one of the issues where i wasn't able to get the right tools and things to run a big pole from that side of the garage that side of the garage so i could mount from chain block i mean this kind of worked out and it saved his purpose anyway what we have here this is the 750 pound as you can see it's only got one wheel in the front two in the back it's it's mounted these bolts they

(Start: 00:01:01)
not the greatest i kind of just put together what i had um there's two 8.8 grades on and there's two 5.6 grades i do however have new bolts which are now all 8.8 grid but we're not here to talk about bolts of course you should be throwing 8.8 on 5.6 will bend 8.8 will break however the 8.8 are a lot stronger and they can handle a lot more force now before we start fully unboxing this something that we can see immediately between the 750 pound is the weight if you look at the net weight on this one it's 18 kgs versus 20 kgs i mean it's a kg difference

(Start: 00:02:02)
what have they done well they've added two extra wheels in the front plus a little bit of an extra support bar unboxing building looks pretty simple i'm gonna go ahead and just carry on set this up a few minutes later all right i've completed the setup it takes roughly 30 to 35 minutes to set one up if you've done one before or if you have another one to just kind of look at but uh realistically let's say 45 minutes let's take a look at the immediate differences just straight off the bat you can see there's two wheels in the front there's a single wheel at the back the base plate looks pretty much identical i don't know if it's my mind playing tricks on me but this one does feel quite a bit heavier than the one that was on this one so the one that's on the engine right now is a 750 this is for the thousand they look identical but i think my mind's playing tricks for me it's saying that the one i'm holding is heavier anyway let's take a look at the back

(Start: 00:03:04)
you can see on this one there's only one bolt holding this back section to what's holding an engine so the section of the wheels only one bolt as opposed to here it's got two bolts in the back one inside set of tools that you're going to need you'll need 17's you're going to need 22's you're going to need land teams the front area where the wheels are same story there's three bolts holding it wheels also held on with some decently strong balls all these bolts are a mix of 8.8 and 8.4 on here i'm actually not sure i could be wrong i can't really read what it says on the top but it looks like the same as this one and this one says df 4.8 and i'm pretty sure that's a four as well 4.8 so immediately you can see these bolts are stronger now let me show you why i have two engine stands right there is a lot of tension on this chain block at the moment for good

(Start: 00:04:04)
reason and that is why the 750 is indeed sagging okay so i've got full slack on here it's sagging this is really dangerous if you're going to be working on something like this it could potentially break stop over fall on your feet it can be seriously harming to your health if you're planning on looking at one of these 750s even for a smaller engine a four-cylinder it's probably not the right choice as it stands this engine is missing it's it's turbo setup it's missing its intake setup alone those parts i'm sorry the alternator the power steering pump the air conditioning a lot of things that our coil packs are

(Start: 00:05:05)
out spark plugs our flywheels off clutches off the base weight of an rb20 det is 280 kilograms as it stands i would guesstimate it to be about 200 kilograms with all those parts that i just mentioned missing at 200 kilograms that is 450 plus minus 460 pounds this engine stand is rated for 750 pounds well why the hell is it not working i did the obvious thing and i started googling and google found a website where people complaining having v8 engines on it and were sagging lightweight v8 engines i'm not too familiar with them one guy had an rv20 and it was sagging this engine stand is no good now you may be able to get away with let's say an engine from a mini or something potentially smaller like a lawnmower but do not

(Start: 00:06:06)
buy this engine stand you're going to be saving yourself a hundred african around maybe 200 african around let's call it 10 us dollars is it really worth it no the only really nice thing about this is there is one wheel in the front obviously it's not good in terms of support but space wise you're not going to have two wheels it takes up a lot of volume this is a problem so i'm going to pull this up now and we're gonna throw it on the 1000 and hopefully i'm not wasting my time with this video and a thousand holds it up to here we go girls moment of truth it's pretty simple to get it on [Music]

(Start: 00:07:09)
there we go just line it up get the locking pin these two are very important this is a locking pin top and this kind of stops this whole assembly from falling forwards and it's also used to rotate okay we are officially on all of these are taught i've ensured that and let's take a look and see if it sags off like sierra does moment of truth does she say [Music] [Applause] yes she does pretty much the same amount of sag as the 750 so what does that mean i've more than likely just wasted money and got full 1000 i probably should have gone for something a little bit higher but that being said they are rated

(Start: 00:08:10)
higher than what the engines are why is it saggy there's no particular reason for it to be saggy other than that stand cannot support it i've done everything correctly i'm using the right grading bolts everything's fine the mounting setup is by the book by the engine stand guard and i've got sag all right guys there you have it that was the test between the 750 pound and 1000 pound i don't know i think i might feel safer that it's in four digits not in the three um i might send it back probably get one of the bigger guys i know there are some 900 kg i forgot how many pounds it is because i'm in south africa i work with kilograms uh i'm not convinced this one is safe enough to actually use so i'll probably send it back however if someone is using a four cylinder this should be sufficient because it's not as long so your weight is kind of sitting the back and it's not going to fall forwards don't take my word for it i don't think

(Start: 00:09:12)
this is a good idea these engine stands i'll probably just waste money if i quite return them hope this helped someone in any way think about subscribing to the channel hit the like button if you enjoyed the video i'll see you all next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be your pro don't waste your time no more who the [ __ ] are you to tell me what to do i don't give a damn if you say you disapprove i'm gonna make my move i'm gonna make it soon and i'll do it because that's what i wanna [ __ ] do cause all these opinions and all these positions they come in in millions they're blocking your vision but no you can't listen that [ __ ] is all fiction cause you hold the power as long as you're dreaming

Title: RB20DET Teardown - Part 1 : Power Steering, AC and Turbo Removal
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k91vWwgHcbY

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome back to the channel I'm going to be working on the RB 20 Det I'm gonna be stripping a couple of things off we're gonna probably film this video in like two or three days before for today because I'm at a time I must start working on the time so I get my rotisserie here I'm gonna do some basic stuff so I want to pull the turbo assembly off for now and then that perhaps you'll see a little bit more in this video so this is actually new so I kind of just put that back on there so look we don't have your photo this whole tournament things also do is obviously we don't need that now missing spark plugs like I said in the previous video I do need to get some new plugs pull this bad boy I will struggle all the ones and yeah Oh perhaps by another six I'm not sure yet change of plans I'm going to take out this useless air company because this getting my way whatever build I do here

(Start: 00:01:37)
okay maybe it's not Louisiana being on that looks pretty much the same as one on the other choices pretty keep us you got my father hard to believe you but I actually have air conditioning on Monte to GTR and it's strong it works really really well so I'm probably gonna keep that AC pump you never know these pops I'll keep the marriage together mattress month Solicitors hello stirring different going to be keeping that guy what else is on that thought my ken block's super-old first edition all tinnitus looks like it's a bit like it's 2/3 102 3 100 at the sentence

(Start: 00:02:43)
what's on line alright next I'm gonna get this power steering pump off give us a piece of excess all right from what it looks like to pull this off you've got a bolt over there what's over there whatever they it's just those three from what I can see and this looks like a tensioning bolt it's really simple all right just a little something-something I am by no means a mechanic and as I mentioned in the previous video I'm learning this is all new to me I mean I pull stuff apart and whatnot but no dummy block work you never pull the engine apart and I'm gonna figure that all out today I can actually

(Start: 00:03:45)
there's a bolt on the front yeah that actually looks like it's holding power steering pump on and not that cradle mount that I just showed you guys of the 3p volts

(Start: 00:04:49)
what sir what would just come loose together okay let's recap we've got two bolts in the front yeah twelve millimeter socket check that out and then there's that one that was holding it up here through three here so you got two on the pulley and then unbolt it and that gets you past and thumb out pretty simple will be a lot more difficult to work on when the engines in the car no just pull the bolts what specific items in one place and then I'm gonna bag and tag set to 12 millimeter this one's a 14 long I think Halstead no I'm gonna bolt yeah there you go good loosen show these

(Start: 00:06:10)
just keep that tough for now let me pull up what I need well no like I said peace be piece by piece stop pulling off the turbo end [Music] maybe a little bit boring for some this is obviously baby work for little people but I'm learning and I want to know everything guys this whole service it it couldn't get a [ __ ] about and you really need a documented I'm just going to rip it off and I'm gonna go for the last top mount manifold and then the tube oh I have an idea my buddy Jonah is selling a t3 t4 reasonable price they are 24 a 2 then minus 5 0 on the exhaust side it's a good price understand my first I wanna

(Start: 00:07:11)
go go for I was thinking maybe a break for up on those number servers to your 518 G I think anything bigger than that you're just gonna have a lag one standing and stop enjoying the clock there than what I don't cause is what you're going into ever bought to call yet doing things backwards here cuz I'm thinning full of gasket mecha missing the stock gasket now short the job

(Start: 00:08:25)
this is what the stock manifold cute little guy what a big actuator I believe these actuators hold local pressure on our b25 on and it's a common trait to actually take this one off and then run our between five tubers which I don't actually know which I think it's a t25 some discoloration on yesterday there's been quite a bit of heat you all know why so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually I broke out this whole tube assembly you try to do it in one go so this two bolts there and so on so forth I wanna be able to get to the back but it's where we can do hmm question is I'm

(Start: 00:09:29)
gonna get to that one of those bendy socket things something bad it's down at the bottom half so that others have been like in Milan this one's good luck it's robbed the bottom so actually designed it for me to do that so you can take it off easier oh no I'm just being an [ __ ] here's the bolt is that the bottom you can get to from the obstacles single actuator if someone told me once you build an engine you gain wanna do it again Kearney it's really addictive I mean I love stripping so I'm ready and I'm already in my element just taking this

(Start: 00:10:44)
I think what I'm going to do just for ease of access to publish it on this video is this looks like a tea full mount fun hung out in the moment top please excuse my tools primitive so these are the top girl

(Start: 00:11:50)
all right I've got a we'll return down here and I'm gonna go oil feed at the top by 1710 collapsing gallery I think there's a book called hottie does it ever again you're watching anything from

(Start: 00:12:51)
here [Music] this is a much nicer setup than the in the rx-7 twin Pharaohs it's such a boy to get to the food super manifold and this lost meaty but again I'm doing this out of the car so I'm saying stuff that I she doesn't I don't even know if teach it's in the engine bay so just got these four bolts what looks like a t4 put at III think it's t3 tire it'll go nice now

(Start: 00:13:58)
that's off [Music] [Music] I know this is probably annoying I'm literally just talking through this whole thing and just easy stuff but like I said earlier I'm documenting myself one of the few YouTube videos that I'm kind of making for myself and I hope it does help somebody else I'll be a lot but I can imagine how shut of a job this must be well it's so little

(Start: 00:15:05)
I'm so shocked I already thought I'm gonna spray less time to ship with two 22 little tang yeah well let's look probably should damn it let me just do I'm talking about a made-up Justin gets never bought because my like I'm just mentioned I'm acceptable [Music] when goes something different I'm gonna go with some loosen ln z r4 [Music] [Music] this is this a lot crazy awkward shape

(Start: 00:16:19)
to do this by hand so it's the one rock [Music] [Music] [Music] we're kin Jessica underfill zaleka [Music]

(Start: 00:17:43)
[Music] you see now it's just stuck on with from what I see here a lot of gasket maker that's nasty see if I can pry it from the bottom maybe see what I mean about having the wrong tools I mean what do you how do you even call this thing I never man groaning bar thing yeah yep so

(Start: 00:18:51)
it's got individual gaskets and there's a [ __ ] ton of gasket maker diesel broken cocked up oh this is probably the worst thing I've seen on this engine so far [Music] if you're not that bad okay cool I guess that's it for this video this will be part 1 I've got like city odd minutes till I gotta call up and go back in the house but looking good so far at least the sod is done the next plan is to pull off the whole intake intake manifold and all that and start working my way down pull up the front pulled pulleys off so I'm going to stop here because I want to document and I mean this sort of stuff I'm tossing the server I'm tossing

(Start: 00:19:51)
actually not much the document I'm just a peck away the power steering pump plus the bolts these obviously when I put a bigger turbo and youtuber on all these badger fittings and hoses they're all going to change my will returns gonna change but I'll keep the stock pop but you never know might be able to do something of the feeling either way I'm gonna get up and we're assuming us in a couple days so I guess we'll we'll pick this up in a couple days I'll clean this up do that wolf chaos I mean you see that and then obviously tackle on the other side and tuck from the top work our way down but like as always thank you so much for joining us see the next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different and you must be

(Start: 00:20:52)
kin think you're gonna anyway just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the domes you gotta take as though you can't be your prototype no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it too you saw these opinions and all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen they're cities on fish because you want the power why is your training

Title: I bought the most abused stock RB in South Africa!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM5x0SAymcY

(Start: 00:00:00)
there comes a time in every automotive enthusiast laughs when you've got to push yourself to the boundaries push yourself to the max get out there and try new things i have finally reached the peak of my automotive existence and i am ready to push myself even further and try out these so-called new things there is only so much tinkering and bolt-ons and tuning that you can do before you've reached your limit and need to move on so my friends without further ado i want to introduce you to the new project on the channel i have purchased one of the most abused stock rb engines in south africa and i'm going to plan on building it on my own [Music]

(Start: 00:01:00)
what up peeps and welcome to the channel as you see i just picked up an rb20 det it is it's stock and i picked it up from someone in johannesburg who is well known in the community he runs something called southsouth crew which is a drifting spinning um just one hell of a crazy community that and he he does mashups between german versus so his event is actually called german versus jeff um super cool guy go follow him on instagram um why did i buy the engine two reasons one it's gonna go in my new car two i wanna experience building an engine from the ground up i've always done bolt-ons i've always done tuning i've always done the basics and i've never gotten down deep and dirty and built something now you may see this like things that are missing i mean i do have a cast sensor in here um that just needs to be put back together so there is some slight bearing knock on

(Start: 00:02:01)
the engine um i mean that can be sorted out i the purpose for this is i want to learn and i want to strip the whole thing apart and get it machined and and build it myself and figure out how to do everything i can do it slowly and it's a cheap engine versus doing it on let's say if i did pop the rb26 or if i had to go and learn the witchcraft that is rotary this is a lot easier and cheaper to make mistakes um so that is the reason why i've picked it up the new car story well i don't have one yet there are plans in the problem and i'm busy looking i've missed quite a few deal deals during this lockdown um there was a 200 sx that or s13 that sold pretty damn cheap it sold for like 36 grand what is that in dollars thousand four hundred dollars cheap with a running cr18 d80 the body

(Start: 00:03:03)
body work looked okay missed it anyway that would have been a cool place to drop this um i'm looking i'm looking as soon as i find something i'm gonna grab it the reason why i want something like that is i want to build something from the ground up these are my babies the r32 gtr is my baby i do want to pull this plastic above soon-ish but anyway this is my baby they might see outside my baby the two rx7s are my baby i don't really want to abuse these cars you know it's it's easier to thrash something around that is inexpensive and and i can go harder it's like when you get a rental car what do you do with a rental car everybody knows you guys get the idea that is my plan i won't get a project car um it will likely have to be licensed if anybody's watching that is from south africa because i don't have a tow vehicle

(Start: 00:04:05)
i mean i could borrow from parents etc but i'm trying to do this on my own for now something i can drive on the road legally would be plus one um open to no license but yeah like i said so that was the story um this is just a quick intro video i don't know how long this video is maybe five six minutes and i'm gonna start doing a tear down in the next couple of days and we're gonna start with let's say taking off the turbo assembly i wanna inspect the turbo not that i'll ever use it it is the stock ceramic um uh muslin table i think it's t25 i don't know if you guys can read that over there but yeah it says listen on it i don't know all the exhaust wheels still occur on it whatever i'll probably just sell it off super cheap to somebody um aircon pump will come out

(Start: 00:05:06)
pop work will come out uh power steering i'll leave on the car um obviously new belts and all that sort of stuff um i've actually got a bunch of rb26 belts there's a brand new one and these also for 26. um i don't know if it'll fit on here how you do some research i know the plugs will actually work and that's called currently the plugs are out um i do need to get a new set for this one so i'll probably get some copper plugs instead of iridium they give a better spark however the interval of replacement is a lot more frequent but it is better for the ignition system to run on the copper ones um i will probably just get an extra six and throw it in here anyway i need to do a compression test but we're gonna pull that side off first turbo indoor first um all the part work manifold come off i want to put the pull injector rails out

(Start: 00:06:06)
it's it's got the stock injectors i think i got 270 cc's you know i want to strip this whole thing two pieces i want to categorize i want to pack up into boxes and just push myself in this new direction where one i need to be organized to i don't even know what two is but i need to be organized and i need to get things labeled so i need a good labeling system i need a good place to pack things and i need a good documentation system which would be obviously the labels but then taking photographs perhaps some video that will not be on the youtube channel just for me to actually review and and see how to put things back together so that is that is something um and then obviously rebuilding it's it's something i've never done before there are quite a lot of people that are are interested in helping there are a few of you that already know uh particularly someone in johannesburg called shark jdm jumbo on instagram these bloody birds outside

(Start: 00:07:07)
always known for me anyway uh jdm jumbo on instagram he's got an orbeez are you done you're done he's got an rb25 powered gtst r32 it's a beast and i forgot what mods he's got on the car um but it's super cool it's in white uh beautiful car um he for a living builds engines and donna tests them and like he he sits inside like this cubicle thing with an engine behind glass and he he downers the engine on its own he does that sort of stuff and tuning so he's an absolute machine when it comes to this and he he's offered to help me build this and give me all the advice that i need um there are other people that i'm forgetting to mention but just an example i am not alone i'm alone in the fact that

(Start: 00:08:10)
clover19 is here and um i am co-morbid uh because i'm asthmatic i don't want to contract anything but seeing anybody i've also got the newborn baby as you guys know and uh it's also a little bit dodgy for me to pick up anything if i do meet up with friends and never mind myself and my newborn and my family but my parents they also have some issues medical issues and this is serious so i've got to do this on my own physically but i know you guys and my friends will be helping me remotely that being said that is it for the video um update on my exciting new project yes let me address that it is sitting on a tire because there was no stock from a place that i generally buy from for an engine or it's history i'm picking one up next week and i'm gonna reshuffle things around just outside this window there's a whole work area i've got a workbench

(Start: 00:09:11)
and uh obviously it links on the other side of this wall is silver x7 black rx7 that's uh um i'm probably going to move it and then because it'll be on the rotisserie and wheels i can freely bring it in and out and whatnot so this is temporary all right thank you so much for for joining us and uh see you next time peace [Music] you

Title: My R32 GT-R is Damaged!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-82ljCDbNM

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Applause] you where the hell have you guys been it's been over a month welcome back to the channel nelkel jdm here otherwise known as nelson probably should be the other way around um i've been gone for a little while uh most you guys have known if you follow my instagram or watch the previous video i think i mentioned the previous video it was like seven weeks ago when i last posted i had a a son i had a newborn lots of excitement bundle of joy and now uh don't even have time to gel my hair tiring we've got a three-year-old at home as well and and she's keeping us busy and it's locked down at the moment still locked down so she can't see her friends we've got the newborn here things are hectic and um just

(Start: 00:01:02)
having a time for cars that's that's the truth and i have no time to make videos about jdm cars for sale and all that sort of stuff and i kind of just decided to take a break anyway i'm not going to say i'm back but i'm here kind of screwed up this car i'm hoping i haven't permanently damaged something on the on the engine but um this big old uh aluminium radiator hello radiator i screwed up so badly a little while ago take a look at see this little scuff marks oh that's not that i [ __ ] it up badly i think i did mention in the last video but this old uh viscous fan over here which is now a very heavy paperweight

(Start: 00:02:06)
um yeah gave me some issues uh long story short when my son was in nrcu off just after he was born um because of lockdown and covert and all that stuff i wasn't allowed at the hospital for a couple days so i wasn't allowed so much support to my wife and my son and uh on day one of me being back at home i had a tinker on the car and i came in here and i started removing these these are the top mount um lost ways they're older things for the for the radiator and so now i'm going to respray them send down re-spray clean up the engine bay cool i got distracted and then i went back inside because i just wasn't feeling it from the garage and i came back the next day and i started the car forgetting that i removed those mounts that's what they call the cool mounts and of course this guy was leaning up

(Start: 00:03:08)
against the radiator because now i remove the mounts and i don't bother checking because i just i wasn't here mentally at the time right anyway we're going to fix the radiator i'm going to show you guys how to fix the radiator now bear in mind the radiator is completely screwed you can see at the bottom you can see at the top that means that water will piss out of it so there is one way to fix it um it actually is pretty simple so if you just take a look closely over here you guys can see that right yeah okay so if you just take a look at it then everything's fine cool let's get cracking so first of all i've decided i'm gonna get rid of the fan and uh got myself this big uh i don't know i don't know it's a 14 inch all right and before i carry on this place is a [ __ ] mess yeah i've

(Start: 00:04:08)
been playing rc cars there's an old um i thought it was a tamiya tt01 for for a long time this thing's probably like early 2000s um i thought it was a tt01 i don't know if you guys know much about rc cars i had to make mine bracket yeah but the battery goes that way the tt01 doesn't go that way it goes that way uh there's a tamiya that's all i know um i've got a dash saver x controller uh remote thing old school um some normal tires and drift tyres and been screwing around with this my daughter had a huge accident coming down my driveway kind of had to epoxy the underside anyway it's not what you're here for uh let me do a quick clean up and then uh we'll start putting that back in the car i didn't realize how easy this was decided to do a little bit off cam i kind of would carry it away and i'm three in um yeah

(Start: 00:05:10)
[Music] so just um find a good position for the fans i already mounted that well when i put it on and i kind of saw that i had more clearance on this side so running a 14-inch fan over there and then these little strap thingies that you kind of just push through it's so simple i mean i have heard of these chafing on on the inside here and damaging the radiator but yeah a lot of other people who have successes with it i'm not running a massively strong car here it's only around 450 horsepower so that's the story that kind of just holds the radiator in place there and then you've got these little dew hookies that you round the end here and then you just trim off what you what you're on using here i'll put those on off cam

(Start: 00:06:13)
i think that's all right that'll do the job now with regards to wiring i need to run a wire all the way back but i want to get the car started because i'm i'm worried because that fan that got caught jammed up the water pump i'm hoping that nothing's wrong um when i did start the car soon after it didn't sound great didn't sound healthy but it sounded like plugs were clogged up i miss the smell of old oil in my hands uh clearance is a lot better now so this this radio is not going i mean this this fan is not going anywhere near the radiator a bit of a [ __ ] to do it with uh just myself and i forgot to turn the camera on um just getting the mounts at the bottom of the line and everything's good it's i've got a lot more clearance than i did with the viscous fan

(Start: 00:07:15)
[Music] all right all right well first of all batteries flat i think yep battery's flat let's go steal the battery much of a mission so this is a silver fd thing

(Start: 00:08:18)
so i know for sure this battery is decent unplugged i forgot to unplug it on the gtr i started this car twice already during the lockdown off cam this car has been started the black fd mrc as you can see it's right there it's due for a car wash today um yeah let me check this out real good hadn't mounted the battery box yet in the rx7 so just picked it up like that easy peasy [Music] it's running it sounds a little rough but it's running very [ __ ] rough

(Start: 00:09:22)
oh [ __ ] i'm just hoping the spark plugs got dirty again i don't i don't think so though i started pulling the plugs out um pretty dirty but it doesn't sound like a distinct um plug noise i think i think i popped my rb26 i think it's working i was so sure i blew the motor i didn't bother picking up the camera for the start-up and i think it's

(Start: 00:10:29)
ignition timing everything seems to be okay [Music] [Music] it's probably a little bit cold so i've done that but uh [ __ ] it celebration it's running flip and running let this be a reminder to every single one of you guys the simplest of things can cause the biggest of problems um let me tell you what was going through my head the entire time i mean it was about 8 to 12 minutes per spark plug removal clean put it back in with a coil pack wiring etc um so call it about an hour the entire

(Start: 00:11:31)
time doing that i'm thinking who's going to rebuild in the engine should i rebuild the engine when can i rebuild the engine because i just had a kid plus it's locked down now so i can't spend money on cars because who knows who knows if i've got a job in the future or or whatnot i mean people living losing jobs left right and center it's scary it's scary the whole world's economy has crashed um i can't just go out and buy a new engine or stop buying pots and i got to think about the kids and wife and you know everything else i've got animals to feed i've got two cats two dogs a house that's all i could keep on thinking about and then one thought cross for lunch i'll sell the car but then i don't really need to sell the car keep it until everything's over the whole pandemic's over then rebuild the car and then anyway that that all that [ __ ] went through my head and it's okay now so the last thing i

(Start: 00:12:31)
need to do is just put in all these little screws from the valve cover and then uh i don't know what i'm gonna do i'm not gonna take it for a drive because i still need to do the wiring so i did some testing here um i just ran this to my positive and then this one over here uh using this little clamp jiggy thing and fan sounds good it's coming on it's it's moving the air in the right direction um that's all that matters it's good i just need to push the wiring through i'm not gonna do that today i'm actually whoa i almost fell over there i was gonna say i'm actually like a bit bamboozled because of the the whole thing it blew um so i'm gonna i'm gonna close up i'm gonna drive it out the garage sweep up the garage and then put it back in here for a little while i

(Start: 00:13:34)
have uh just before you click off the video i have something big something jdm and something cool arriving in two to three days anyone guess what it is let me know in the comments section it's something i've been wanting to do this for a very very long time um it's big it's jdm and it's cool those are the only clues i'm giving you guys let me know what you think uh cousin girls thank you so much for joining me sorry i haven't been around for the last six to seven weeks you guys know the story you heard at the beginning of the video see you all next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow you can't be a pro don't waste your time no more who the [ __ ] are you to tell me what to do i

(Start: 00:14:34)
don't give a damn if you say you disapprove i'm gonna make my move i'm gonna make it soon and i'll do it cause that's what i wanna [ __ ] do cause all these opinions and all these positions they coming in millions they're blocking your vision but no you can't listen that [ __ ] is all fiction cause you hold the power as long as you're dreaming

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on girls and welcome back to a brand new video no I know exactly what you guys are thinking oh I've been lazy I haven't posted content because I just didn't feel like it I have good reason good news and some bad news my son was born a couple days ago and unfortunately he had to go to NICU and he's in ICU at the moment and it's not fun and the worst part is that because of Hawk coronavirus I was only allowed at the hospital for a couple days during the birth and well I haven't been allowed back so my wife is there my son is there it sucks he's getting bit eyes with some issues of his lungs and whatnot anyway and I'm cause I've been trying get my mind off things and I figured I pick up the camera a little bit late but I did pick it up so whatever I've been doing I have finally installed moral catch-can and I'm going to quickly tell you guys

(Start: 00:01:01)
because they're probably the title of the video how I set it up so he has moral cash counts and gritty you know I do you need to get one of those little filters just like that we're gonna pick one up another day throw one on here so I've got this big part of forgot the Diamonds I bought this in October 2019 it's now maybe something I've got this big pup running across to the top of there then I've got my jointer that joins the other side so all the cars have that standard it's usually a black you know one of dead as I've blocked it off this end here it goes into the turret so from here there's not the pop you'll see that and what I've done these blocking pieces that actually worked out damn well before I tell you I got the room here's another one what up dude is of what these rubber feets they actually put tables and legs of chairs etc I just bought a whole lot of

different sizes and obviously I mentioned idea of the Pops and all that stuff or than what the rod stuff and it actually works like one osteitis through some clamps on them and I'm pretty happy with how the job came out now after looking at a whole lot of different setups of oil cap cap I mean there's tons and tons and tons on the internet guys we'll run two pups across here into a couch cam and then have a breather unfortunately I've only got a two-port so I'll have one breather and then this pup but it's exactly the same thing with joining and then yeah so this would be uh tentacles they're having two pops coming across and then having a 3 port watchable cord well Ketchikan and then here the common thing is just to block off the turbo and so what this is gonna do now loss for words but positive crank something something it hopefully will start pushing oil through to this gritty cash get anyway there's so many other setups it's also looking dismal one that'll sit over there and what will happen the top

(Start: 00:03:02)
one will feed off the side so your block off there your block off there you'll have that will go into the mismo one another into the turbos and there's just there's so many different setups this is the one that decided to go for I was gonna be that whole jewel thing I've actually got an additional popping up there and actually I was thinking about using the braided channel mine went for the black but they end up gonna go to 2fort so I figured I went to us exactly the same setup as that like I explained with the two hoses coming across been some more bad news so this has been going on a couple days with the whole Hospital thing and I come out my head hasn't been right I kind of broke my radiator on this car I don't have it here I go to my old man and he's taken it through to a place called Silverton radiators and I was stupid not to pick up this camera and show you guys but the damage was hectic basically what happened is I was fooling around and cleaning up stuff and I moved one of the

(Start: 00:04:03)
radiator mouse one of those guys and one of those over there and I'll just keep me up and cleaning stuff in that I came back the next day and forgot that I did that and then I started off and here's the biscuits fair yeah most of the blades have bent and especially though unknown us but running radiator so what happened as the radiator kind of went forward slightly I really wasn't thinking it was just a stupid mistake of buying and the fan went into the radiator broke right through the top in tanker broke right through the bottom in tank wasn't pretty anyway it's gonna go in for appears I don't know how much gonna cost if it's too experienced I'm just gonna buy another new one and then I've got an

(Start: 00:05:05)
electric fan already it's 14 inch in a creek fan that's crack one of these Universal ones on a coin import stuff right now and nobody has stock of sports which is apparently the guy to make free electric fans when you doing high-performance stuff and yeah we still unlock down at the moment so it's difficult for for me to do bar stuff and I mean how the corn even gets to the hospital they won't allow me and so a combat performance car pods so I'm going to do with regards to this is I'm gonna run the wiring through there like I've done with everything else like my boost controller and all other goodies comes through the wheel arches and inside and then I'm gonna get when I'm allowed to import stuff again it was going to be fun I'm gonna buy one of those they're my switches I've looked around I don't see anybody in South Africa actually sells them it's a little famous switch that price key you will put you know like your water temperature sensor you'll plug it in over here the third my god and then that will read and when a head

(Start: 00:06:06)
stuck simply nod eighty degrees it'll flip over and then make a cradle come on it's a pretty basic stuff and the interim I have much of the cap tire wire while I need there anyway but that's gonna get for three months feeding stuff probably tomorrow and then I'll just run a switch temp research in North Korea or manually we're not this house needs to go this is the house for my overflow and there goes the radiator I'm gonna put a nice red one or black ones that are hanging over there I redid my my lip in the front in wasn't happy with the positioning plus when people come over to work in the closet me I get a lot of people hanging on the bonnet while talking and whatnot I gradually been breaking and repealed pretty annoying to up just filled it with silicone underseater smooth interrupt I'm just giving a little time to skin

(Start: 00:07:07)
I'm gonna do another Curtis silicon on how to smooth it up oh it's looking good I just here fix the gaps in the top and then what else that I do for one of those things are for the mold because it's quite some old issues so that the rx-7 ivory mounted my a pixie commander [Music] know it's got a Velcro no and that's an a pixie holder actually it kind of odds I mean from my point of view so that's that's my point of view condom and my point of view down here klonda odds a tiny little - bubble that I've got yeah a common issue with all three T's oh yeah I also readed my wiring so I pulled this kick panel of yesterday pulled all the

(Start: 00:08:09)
stuff and I redid one of our grounds because what was happening when I was putting this kick panel on it was pushing on my ground this rot down the ground would often come these other feels remember like two or three videos ago I had some electrical issues like I've kept this and shouldn't come round again well that was the problem I fixed that join the wires put a little loop the loop lost for words can't think about anything or now a little thing and yeah honey given us this open I'm saying to get rid of it for ages anyway this cause been getting some much-needed TLC and I'm kind of falling around and been doing random stuff um I'm fortunate enough to have my mom here and my mother staying over at a house until my wife gets back glad I'm not in a rut like mental state to look after my

(Start: 00:09:11)
daughter and she's three years old three years old she's very demanding and yeah I mean you got to give her a lot of attention and like I said I'm on the right mental space I'm taking it easy anyway that's that's it for this video I'm gonna go play with it more - nah I'm not gonna bother filming it because oh this is more about the r32 GTR this video I've got an exhaust leak on it and I'm gonna throw on something called gum gum gum gum yeah gumgum I'm gonna throw this stuff on try get that exhaust leak to go away it's a good on the hitter side I think there's tons of videos after Chris fixes that everybody's done I'm not gonna bother [ __ ] looking yeah every 26 needs a cleanup dirty dirty dirty anyway thanks for listening and actually felt pretty good picking up the

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel we're going to be doing a DB test on all of my JDM cars that includes two Oryx Evans the GTR the mr2 and we're gonna get a baseline on the Lexus how we're going to be doing this gareth not going to be setting up a DB or SPL meter on our cellphones I know it's not the professional one I'm not going to be buying one just for a video we're going to be sitting up on our phones we're gonna get a baseline off the Lexus thereafter Lexus is just behind it's an is 250 2.5 v6 once you get a based on on a cold start all these cars have been started a very long time I mean they're all start will make sure they will for the video and we're gonna see who wins I have a feeling it'll be the rx-7 GTR oh come in sick in the MRC third rx-7 black one second to last and Lexus lost let's see [Music]

(Start: 00:01:28)
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:02:34)
[Music] [Music] [Music] alright guys I hope you enjoyed the video we're gonna be really looking at this test in the future because we're not 100% sure the numbers that came out

(Start: 00:03:35)
off our cellphones while it was cool during the test it might not be as accurate as you thought it would be and we should probably get some proper DB meters to us you know in the comments section if you'd like us to do those we test the cars maybe get some other people come through and test the cars and let's see what does now the cool thing I don't know so in that car but the exhaust manifold was blowing Barack read the cars only on for like three or four minutes crazy I don't know if it's a good or bad thing but Russell didn't warn me about it and well it's running hot and it's running loud I don't think the numbers that we go to for cellphones really give us an accurate representation of what especially the rx-7 is running the rx-7 is crazy loud but maybe we should redo this in the future hope you guys enjoyed the video see all the next one peace [Music] you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really

(Start: 00:04:36)
think you're different and you must be kin think you're gonna get me but just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the domes you gotta take as though you can't be your prototype no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it [ __ ] - you saw these opinions and all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen their cities on fish because you want the power why is your training

I don't even bring the camera outside because spark plugs which of the two months ago Anabella to [Music] good let me try github in the garage another push so sorry let me just start the car [Music] hi somebody ever sooner [Music]

(Start: 00:01:17)
okay mr. smiley Malakal is working [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:02:22)
[Music] don't believe it ran a little bit of a scare there Carlton want to turn off at the key out turbo time I was off that was pulled out because I realized that I've set up on the Hornets for the what you McCord what do you call that the ignition harness it just wasn't running so what Arthur quickly ran up and that isn't ripped it off camera just ripped it and then the car switched off turbo still smoking a lot I think I probably should pull the tipper up by myself because the lock down but I'm

(Start: 00:03:23)
going to switch the cars around I'm gonna get the skull on the garage because at least I can do some skyline work and yeah go from there what's up guys and welcome back to the vlog I've been meaning to make this video for ages now I really have been keeping a secret from you guys it's super good news specifically for me not really for the channel but my wife and I are expecting a baby boy in 15 days yeah yes that would explain a lot as to why I win a war for a little while and it's scary Tom's because it's obviously happening during this whole covert 19 coronavirus story which means we're gonna have to go into the hospital there's some uncertainty about me actually seeing the birth of my child we've heard mixed responses from the hospital they have however said more than likely I'll be able to go in for one day the day of the birth and that's it but that's the news it's it's really

(Start: 00:04:25)
cool it's exciting I'm getting a boy school a birdie I've got my daughter I mean I love her to bits but she's not so much into cars and as much as I'll force to get out she's not kidding I'm not gonna force him either but he should be into guys because I mean my dad's in because his dad was armed its Cosmo for the clicks cause I clicked JDM record cause let's see what happens and then there's something that would have been awesome if it happened I was like this close to owning another car and it was something that I had on my checklist on my bucket list or whatever collectors list that I want and that is a Mitsubishi GTR found on for sale on Friday and I mean you guys know me I just looked through cause audit on gumtree overtakes all the websites I'm constantly looking at all the hand like Scala and Subarus blah blah you name it and I saw this GTR and it was fifty thousand rand which is nothing uh top of

(Start: 00:05:27)
my head I think it's two thousand three hundred US dollars plus bonus and you know it's kind of one of those things we have thought in the back of my head it's it's too good to be true it's probably a scam and I made contact with the owner after speaking to my wife these can I get the car it's super cheap can we get it now because we're expecting a newborn there was a little bit of an argument like every time like when I had my daughter the blackhawks even arrived month after she was born four months off that she was born so far except in Iraq and then mr2 about a year later and now I'm doing it all over again now that my son is arriving anyway almost picked up this car friend Iona made contact after getting clearance and stuff and unfortunately the car is not what I want

(Start: 00:06:30)
because it doesn't have papers and it's a sad thing our con register the car its energy it needs to have all the clearance documents etc so for example watching this you have to import thus in the country of origin so you need to sit in Japan or let's say if it wasn't Botswana or something you'd have to get all the sale paperwork done in that site there would be a shaken document which is an the registration document on other country we ever came from once you've got the D registration document then you apply via the NRCS and itec for import permits and a clearance then you do SARS and then obviously you get your shipping done so you have to do all this stuff all the countries the car is in the country of origin if it came from wait were you buying it from you can't just do it while the cars here and there are ways and means but not for me I'm doing a property once you got all that stuff then obviously you follow your normal procedure which is Weybridge data dot C

(Start: 00:07:33)
are all that stuff exactly what I've done with the GTR the TRX Evans etc the MRT was really done picked it up locally and era OS bought this car I mean as the Austin see in the pictures the cost super neat with regards to modifications and he had like an aluminium intake pop I don't know why and a dump valve and that's it and the car is neat a couple scratches and whatnot but I mean wasn't crashed and bashed and dented so almost had it gone now I know it's not gone still for sale I mean it's gone for me it's still for sale if you guys want to just drop me at DML seen designers details actually a super cool dude we've made contact for Instagram now we were chatting and realized like-minded cars and all that stuff though you know remind of Gus all friends that is it for the video a little bit of short one but it is an update and oh I forgot to tell you that means that content is going to

(Start: 00:08:33)
be a little bit less than what you guys have been experiencing recently so obviously there's been a big surge in content as of late and it's not going to be that way for a while obviously the newborn is gonna take precedence but there is a story and before he's born on me cracking on sorting out the skyline that I'm trying to figure out what's the best for the RB 26 and with regards to an oil catch can get that out of the way obviously pop work and everything I've got I just need figure out which is the best if anybody's watching that has an orbit 26 there's so many different options to go for let me know let me know what do you think about this car I've done nothing I'll just open the bonnet just to look at it again to see if there are no rats and so I just want to finish the skyline if they're running because at the moment I can't drive on the road and obviously we lock down the moment currently

(Start: 00:09:34)
unlocked down but I could still drive it to the shops this sort of that is it for the video thank you so much for putting up with me and I'll see you all next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different and you must be kin think you're gonna anyway just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the domes you gotta take us no you can't be your prototype no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it too you saw these opinions and all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen they're cities on fish because you want the power why is your training

something out took today is he's a cool dude I think he's well he was a cool dude till he got a BMW just kidding anyway thank you so much for sitting it through if anybody wants to see me stuff it's in the description there is a pure box address it just looks about is pure box two two zero eight nine being Ashley Durban South Africa just listed to nelq LJ DM or whatever whatever you want to call me it'll come through this one took a couple months to come through but anyway bloody awesome heartwarming I just just just got back into vlogging making videos again like this week and just to see something like that to receive something togethers is super cool well anyway I'll just I realized now it hasn't been three years and someone save me something Jason sent me about a year and a half ago Jason sweet and he sent me a whole bunch of sweet to send me a down pop he sent me an intakes

(Start: 00:03:06)
he sent me like cool stuff and before that was probably two years ago I received away from United States super super generous see that holder for the APEC CPF see that's an arm magic : it was sent to me by another subscriber and there's been probably missing out a couple things so sorry if I do but I have been really grateful in the past and I still AM if you guys want to see me anything feel free so let's get right into it I want to do a quick update on all the cause it's sort of the GTR GTR Sparkle for the moment because I've been on a mission and their mission is to stop messing around on one car they're moving on to the next one in the next one and then you know I'll tell you guys why I stop vlogging I've got a bit despondent offed a little while and I'll stop vlogging for about two months three months of Instagram plus - I'm back as of today I stopped because I kept

(Start: 00:04:08)
breaking everything we're not breaking but I was like for example who I got a cool new radiator for the r32 GTR so stripped everything while I'm doing that I'm busy stripping the mr2 and doing bodywork and paint well that's happening I'll strip the black car to throw the parts into the silver car sorry the black two reports into the silver aft so the black cars off London and then I was trying to work on this thing trying to get it running and then at one stage I had four cars that weren't working and weren't drivable it was absolutely ridiculous so I'll stop vlogging I stopped posting on Instagram and I just focus I actually stopped talking to car people altogether I have made a video about this but anyway I'm back on track now I've been so we're not starting the last three - then it's perfect I've been daily driving the MRT sw20 taking it to work most days not when it rains because I don't like the whole engine situation block being slightly open plus the alternator belt belt squeals when it gets wet it's a little bit embarrassing cause super fun to drive I had real

(Start: 00:05:10)
lawmen thought I had balancing done and it drives like a dream I'm yet to experience the whole what he called snap oversteer thing I probably just don't have that much power in the car it's experience but I pushed it hard I push the hard a couple corners and cool really awesome car black if T we end up for driving that now my wife wants some cool drink so let's jump to that I'll talk about that don't have to check if it's in neutral this was a put some [ __ ] she liked this double doing CD player thank you you guys can watch the class stuff a little bit more well the drive I have trio shoes of this car one as you can see the

grief counselors away at the common issue to my fishing huh oil pressure drops like zero so take my foot off the accelerator see that so what's been happening as I've been getting to stop Street and traffic lot and I'll stop and sometimes a call will die out especially on a hot day if it's a hot day the car kind of dies out which is which is an issue and procedure for that is me throwing the car into park somebody goes get [ __ ] done throwing the client park foot on the brake switch it back on throw it back into drive it's quite annoying that it takes like three extra seconds in a manual pump started up get the impatient like behind you

(Start: 00:07:16)
anyway before you guys start jumping to conclusions as to what the problem is it's definitely not definitely but every form says the same thing it's oil pump well pump well pump which it wave may well just be but this issue and he started when I put the standard exhaust whoops when I put the standard exhaust in the car I saw head that stand exhaustion silver carp you guys watching that the previous video like a Eureka and after putting the standard exhaust from the silicon here which had a cat I have this heat clock which come on now have this heap locks and ever since then since that day I've been getting the syrup Risha at stoplights and ya'll say that was home

(Start: 00:11:25)

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's going on girls and welcome back to the channel today we're going to be looking at some crashed and brokenness and skylines up topic straight into the video I found a bunch of crashed scotland's are thirty twos threes fours big crash damaged somewhere there's is a GT or a blown engine I'm going to show you them I'm going to show you how much they sold for and I'm gonna talk a little bit about the damage I mean I'm no penalty though I'm no mechanic but we can try to figure out if the causes worthwhile or not now I'm gonna be seeing this stuff for the first time too so you can see I've opened up a whole bunch of tabs at the top you have been doing everything by eye Japan partner I found these cars about two days ago and bookmarked all of them I literally saw like tiny little pictures like one picture like what I'm pointing at this city I saw the whole picture like that and you see the back the size but every buck my cars crash so I thought I'll save the bookmark and we diving right

(Start: 00:01:01)
into this video for the first time seeing how in or 30 for 2.5 g TX 2 so those things are RB 25-minute it'll be one of those are be 25 years it's an ER 34 so those things got a whole a tape on it looks like the tape was holding up the bump Oh doing some any other sorts but they obviously had to pop the hood and perhaps jumpstart it so I can get it into the auction it's pretty dinged it looks like it kind of went under something hey let's cost solved in half thousand US dollars in tears pretty neat I'm surprised I actually put this covering on a lot of cars even the perfect running ones and they don't have these covers on them oh that's a nasty smash it looks like a dude who's been hit on into a pole M focus okay I'm pretty sure yes I mean it looks bad but to be on time een I don't see like any crumple damage or anything like on the eight

(Start: 00:02:02)
pillars the wheels are still okay the bumpers probably cooked it is sitting outside so it's like does it run you know to manual which is a plus got some off to market looks like a fake Nardi wheel missing the radio and all that all the wires are just hanging around everywhere looks like it had some sort of a navigation system maybe and a decent front loader radio or maybe another nav system there you see this a lot care they were like I don't like a TV or display and or that looks like this has ripped it up before the car went on to the auction anyway the cost solved for one thousand US dollars which was nothing I really really wonder it's gonna be go unfortunately I can't read Japanese I've mentioned the past lotion sheets that when I was interested in buying my cars I mean I did bother cause I had them translated for me I don't know what it says I probably learned some tongue I'll probably pilots car I mean thousand

(Start: 00:03:04)
brigita fixed I don't know I remember seeing this little picture this is the gtst type M it sold for two and a half thousand years dollars and one hell of a thud smash I do not think even with a jig you could straighten the sand and get it rot I really don't I mean lose every pore garden honestly I don't know if you walked away from this getting the back is just like boom the rear trunk boot whatever you gonna call it is just like snapped I feel bad oh I can't look I said was you know was probably like a little scooter no metal bark some sort of motorbike bang right there just behind a seat I mean the impact on that muscle look on head I don't know not good actually it

(Start: 00:04:06)
could have been a big car and he kind of went in then I don't know either way I hope the driver walked away from that without any serious injuries two and a half thousand years oh well here that Lots pictures I don't think it was worth the money I mean it looks good like I said yeah like I could talk it against the side of my house and or you go to skylights and what's really cool isn't it it's keep in the back I think this would be a pot car stuck wheel someone's really stir than that I'm stood on the gauge the radio is gone so the fifth is quite high from chatting to the guys at Japan partner while ago my weapon able to God but these outdoor locked cause I mean they're they're sitting out there for weeks and stuff

(Start: 00:05:07)
does gets messy especially with these crashed ones cuz the windows are open so it's unfortunate to see but a two and half thousand dollars now that makes up another GTS 25 top M this is a 33 variant 28,000 kilometers solve two thousand two hundred years dollars I mean that's obviously the sort of smash is a lot more I mean look it's did they into could have and there's probably some issues I mean what's on that sergeant power steering pump I think it's that son I don't remember I keep jumping between my jetty and cars and I forget which ones which another intakes on that side and I don't know they would have obviously been a lot of damage air conditioning but that looks like an office market intercooler definitely an aftermarket it's good

(Start: 00:06:07)
probably paint mounts berming look this is repairable unfortunately two pictures that is pretty I think I think for two thousand two hundred US dollars this one probably because I don't have a thick through you know on a paid fee this one is with locked and I'll see the option was in Okinawa on the way it's going up color chocolate little thing someone on the comments section tell me is everything chocolate color or 33 moving around on I don't like doing this I mean I like picking up deals but I don't like having to look at least poor I really feel

(Start: 00:07:09)
sorry for them I do feel sorry 4,600 years dollars I mean those damaged really doesn't look that bad yeah but little support is gone and Fasil plastic covers and all the stuff missing indicators the lots gone into kudos gone that's cool it's gone off to market exhaust off democra wills and low BMW film thinking I don't know what to ship that is I think this is Ariel or katana holder know that but he's going to those in one lips from the backup though on my GTR yeah looks looks we had without the without the spoiler our thoughts good what can I say this is this is really I

(Start: 00:08:13)
think this is with me if I have to get another one this one I will look at that he's got the same wheel that I've got with missing the gentle thing see if particular thing does my gear shifter anyway cops baekje or just cool see for me this one will be a bargain because the front can be fixed I like these pictures look cool how cool is this I mean also doesn't got a run to the been my my black FD had Vig subscribers arm a but if you just go back a couple videos a couple like maybe 70 videos okay I'm fine when my black FDA Robert had DVD player had a six to see shuttle of had antennas Panasonic talkie radio phone satellite phone whatever the hell it hadn't some sort of nav like this I

(Start: 00:09:15)
had a TV it was stupid pull a up threw it away there's a whole bunch of crap in the back yet what is this stuff that's this is the bumper that drives a pieces of it about what would you keep those pieces of the bumper doc seriously hi hi hi Marla 294 thousand kilometers I like that there's a lot of pictures I mean my city to the black ft and three pictures plus the auction sheet my silver exhibitor like five pictures this is super cool you're really kind of gauge which bike kind of wish I could have put these we can't because no the collector certainly needs to be a GTR to be a collector's item anyway I like this one my favorite by

(Start: 00:10:16)
far if you have a load of three dammit I might get a shot give me some I click on a thing and I did I did see what the last one is I kind of dragged it to the end when I was trying to figure out in the beginning I had a slot technical issue and they're surprised that for you guys to pictures sold for 9,000 years dollars r33 GTR no no I don't know it's missing a head lads this is beyond but I think for police Africans it's a perfect aftermarket exhausts some funny little badge there maybe it says tommy kaira no I think it does missing the GTR logo it's got a spear with all the fronts there will probably buckle like

(Start: 00:11:16)
that's sad because any two pictures that's got stock seats home we've got a stock steering wheel ha where you don't know for not thousand years tours mmm that's a bit pricey a little bit pricey and it's an Egret which means rotten interior and exterior have something for me cuz they're a thousand kilometres but no goodbyes that's one yes I remember those okay this one didn't sell it hit a reserve of $1,800 don't know what's wrong and I think it's just a smash usually if there's an engine problem they put something in here that says engine  door and it's got this thing on the front which sure it's damaged in the front if it is a three freaking pictures I just I don't get maybe the other side

(Start: 00:12:19)
of the car's front bumper looks okay what's good tape on it I don't know it's missing the front girl there the rod how it looks a bit wonky maybe it doesn't have an engine I don't know this is why I had it up in the screen if you can read Japanese pause the video take a look you finished that you're like let me know in the comment section what the hell's wrong with this car didn't sell at all this is on 28 to the FIB 4,800 year's dollars it's an or 32 GTR what's going on yet that reminds me oh man it's gone okay probably gone there was and there

(Start: 00:13:20)
is in the coop there was a not a 303 to GTR with a blind engine my confirmed blind engine and I had tons of pictures it was dusty was sitting in the shade the body look good it was straight and it just had a blown engine re to me six and engine bay pictures and whatnot and I saw this yesterday and I forgot to add it to the collection I probably should have filmed this video yes then you guys would see it so the next cheapest ones 22k they won thirteen thousand for that a lot damn alright maybe on from that this one's not exactly broken I just I wanted to show you guys it was it's all four to nine thousand dollars it's gone - it's probably an RV 20 unit it is ideas are

(Start: 00:14:20)
between 2,000 CCS it's got a hundred and sixty one thousand kilometers on it it's and some are which means it's not so great and it's a rebuild something has been rebuilt in the car and I can tell you straight away it's this bumper yes this hideous bumper not even a lot I mean like the deed Ilana there and then you ran out of time and just figured like it off put some bubble gum who was it green I don't know what is that backlash on there because he drifts out in this bumper comes flying you know it probably wants of maybe see this video backlash what a road rash my girl actually I think it was crashed on the side there's no picture there's no picture shut up but look at this look at this freakin crumpled up piece of  head looks like I put together putty in and was about the black day

(Start: 00:15:23)
because there is still it's black the deuce I like either really short yes period is really short what's just steering wheel up all the way there turn a half thousand dollars no not for me alright that concludes the skylines and I'm gonna will surprise for you guys know like how old super guard side look at that ass look at that ass oh look at that oh my god that super got up another supposed to be a skull on video but I figure we could turn this into the series do you guys wanna see more with us and I promised you guys a series of the JDM cars for sale so African I was gonna do it monthly but we are on lockdown that whole trevor 19 quarantine lockdown

(Start: 00:16:24)

what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel today we're going to be talking about that abandoned r32 that I found some time ago there's been a lot of questions that I've left unanswered and figuring out kind of deal with it right now the most important is where's the car what's happened to it I'll get to that in a minute first you need to know a little bit of history if you haven't checked out the video they're kind of viral on one my Instagram and two on my youtube channel okay well it seems my youtube channel wasn't that far out I need three and a half thousand views my Instagram however it at 18 K so this was actually a year ago just over a year ago that I found this r32 in Durban abandoned sort of abandoned I mean I can't I just left it outside and I think this this has run through the video and all I'll give some commentary on it by scale is driving there when picked up gareth picked up another made to continue the area we drove through i mean it's actually it's

(Start: 00:01:01)
not that far away from my house day and he made sure we got there there was a little senior that i cut out some of it that space give me just holding the camera down to the floors recording the the owners voice and he said no okay could take a look go for it at the time he wanted I think he won a 25,000 rent I actually don't remember it was either 20 or 25,000 in which equates to whatever is in dollars flashing on the screen here it is it's an or 32 GTS models that has an RV tweeny it was an automatic rear wheel drive speed little in the back now this was interesting I didn't pick this up in the video but I had some of my Instagram helped me out this is Jaron he is like a pot collector slash really cool read old school knows my like a seller I

(Start: 00:02:05)
don't know a steer to where this is an illuminating panel illuminating Scott on panel and it's it's ultra rare was an optional extra and obviously it found its way onto this car which is pretty cool I mean I actually wouldn't have monitored for mine obviously spread silver if it worked but whatever I mean this this could be worth like 500 years easy anyway we took a walk around the car some interesting stuff there was there just to cut back a little bit quite a bit of rust but mail-order stuff could be cut out and replaced rust on the back of the seats that's like whatever missing a windscreen and just just by the way I have found the car now I'm gonna be showing footage in a second we're just doing a quick recap it was missing the front head lots lots of scrapes was nice big nasty dent in the back other side whatever that's up come on your shirt nothing so it's on the

(Start: 00:03:06)
side of it yeah you GT Legos now this I got horribly horribly wrong I thought this was the third month of 2014 horribly wrong I had so many my comments in chin yeah because are interested in mm since the sticker shows 2002 which is he say 14 and Japan's calendar system cool then that was a car missing one side Mehra thing and I actually did want it I eventually sat down with a wife and I said look I probably won't do anything with the car for a very long time it'll just kind of like sit in the corner of the cover uh but I think it's worthwhile buying and I went in with a lowball offer and the guard is basically said to me nice all these Grammies gonna take 20 or 25 and I

(Start: 00:04:06)
don't remember but he was adamant losing it that number in order to stalk the Quogue in later on that month those 28 April now I'd spoken to my probably on the tin 11 also actually had a mutual mate from work you know it was mutual and he tried and negotiated still wouldn't budge cool 28th of April we passed to look at the coastal they're keen I was lucky something happened that week I got super busy doesn't speak to him didn't get frenum and then I got a message from a buddy of mine so the message you guys like this out of the blue last conversation I had with my bed was and 23rd of June on the 26th 2 p.m. he says me a message saying someone bought the r32 you from 12,000 Rand what is that Donna tier and it's kind of hyper moment

(Start: 00:05:09)
but twelve thousand six hundred fifty one years dollars it had an RV 20 and it was running it obviously needed a lot of work as he goes in this video but the rest of my message Kona wind you're kidding me even when to budge 1000 red we bought it yeah I'm so pissed Arana by the way he also is interested in the car and I said to them all you can offer them what they want for it but they're not budging and it is a friend of mine who's the guy that bought it not sure who it is exactly well I know who it is I found her and I'm gonna show you guys now this leads us to an unnamed Instagram page the robbers name tried to make contact with them I sent him a message I actually met him at a company called mr. turbo you're spying something I think he was buying in a metaphor for his rb25de he was by

(Start: 00:06:13)
manifold for 2j that's that then Austin what caused it going a season s for an or 32 not those are teats here's another one and we kind of got talking and I'll say there was a little GTR and I love about swap details cool got kind of ignoring me now and I don't know why anyway um you know it's maybe he stole my original video and he yells interested in buying the cars or the crappy part is he bought a comfortable of K I offered 15 I started at 10 and then I'm Rick more apt 15 why did he get it for 12 I don't know I'm almost wearing headphones anyway that pissed me off and nothing I can do about the cost long gone I mean this was May 31st a month after I went to go and take a look at the car here this is it this is him

(Start: 00:07:13)
with the corner trailer that obviously must have pushed it on tires super flat still missing all the issues there's a dent that I sold you guys about the little signs good things coming off from the back and I mean cool maybe I went to good hands but I could have had it anyway what's been done to the car they actually went up for sale again and went up for sale and I mean this is all public records it was on gumtree or LX 102 couple months ago and he won a 65,000 Radford which was a huge price increase three half thousand dollars for what had been done to now bear in mind does car cannot be driven legally on the road ever yeah because it was not important to correctly it was not brought in as a returning resident it was not Portland as a collector's item and there's another collector's item because not okapi to GTR 33 or 34 GTR it

(Start: 00:08:15)
is a GTS you can only bring it in as a returning resident well not born that way I'm not gonna mention how it'll probably not do now I did find out from Ariana but right this is the corner it got a respray so it's been resprayed it had all the panels and all this stuff sorted out which is cool not still missing lots in the front just taking a quick look you can see the rust has been sorted out that's probably blasted overhead put an ankle grinder and I don't know it looks like some sort of a gray hammer up baby hammer out paint I don't know back of the seats of Pekerman soda there's still no real windscreen which is said I know you can pick up these rear windscreen PG auto gloss can make them for you so you want to 65 K as it's got a new set of wheels on it it's got a fresh set of tires on it and I believe it was running here it is that's a pity I should have

(Start: 00:02:02)
you guys know I've actually wanted an inline fuses oh look it's a little black fuse holder thing with like some wires coming out of it and then one of these fuses goes inside this is just a little brothers and brothers or parents or brothers are so Bobby decided to do some stuff both camps I can't make me less of a [ __ ] job this is number 87 on your Bosch food and that goes to you the quilt pack number 86 only this guy so this comes from which a very sober typed up and everything using properly electrical tape that's connecting the source which is the ignition ignition on and that's in the power 86 it's gonna get ground this one was ground and this is your 12 volt constant and this one that I just sold it on now is Cooper

(Start: 00:03:06)
with 87 top is total world here we go so that's to the coil any six will be this blue one rod yes it's 86 86 is getting 12-volt ignition from the original coil wire 86 was getting 12-volt from a source and thick t-this garvik yeah super long cable you smoke it up that's why it back on yeah temporarily that looks good what I'm going to do now is I'm gonna throw a multi me down here well that plug there are you next we'll see if we get power on a mission the ignition is on for some

(Start: 00:04:08)

(Start: 00:07:32)

(Start: 00:01:00)
steal picked up a pretty basic mix on how about supposed to get an NRG what should I call it quick release and then I decided against it just I mean this is a Marty I'm gonna daily hit no I got the cheapest hub possible which means my man offered because it kind of just said it was for Tierra [Applause] really useful to something out yeah what are we doing we gonna wash all right it looks like hopefully guys can see

(Start: 00:02:03)
there's a screw over there and then this specific thing has a bunch of screw holes looks like it's just a Phillips screwdriver and then I should be able to get this guy off obviously with the big seems not my air bag so yeah smoker wheel at us and take this thing let's never ever ever do that again while holding my camera good lord I almost dropped the [ __ ] thing sort of stopped recording for a bit because I'm sweating like a [ __ ] and the camera is getting in my way 40 degrees this whole weekend and he's

(Start: 00:03:04)
lost food has been crazy he'd like 34 fish degrees my calls the Lexus was showing up 40 degrees at one time parked outside so pull that screw off directly underneath here and then I got these four squeeze of fish and I waited and that's come out also that our office steering was gonna be the easiest unplug here that's just for the heater button and then undo that not figure out what it is no looks like a 16 17 I'm gonna stop calling out random numbers because actually in 1900 cz I remember Laura Cavanaugh I've been farting her thing fuller two minutes eventually it came off right so I'm gonna put the hub on there taking a

(Start: 00:04:06)
wild guess here but this is probably what you guys hate about this channel is I don't like do a DIY video we are gonna say guys this is how I'm gonna do it I'm trying to figure out everything as I go along and I'm just pulling away being an idiot maybe I [ __ ] out here I'm pulling this thing off because I physically can't get it on I made a little wolf cam progress but I haven't issued just thinking about logically I think this thing has to stay in there otherwise if I run the the horn or hoots a cable and I start telling the wheel it's gonna start wrapping around so it has to run within this thing but this physically stops the wheel hub from getting in I think I'm gonna modify this chop this off so loose wire on and then hope for the best after you have it working there okay the horn buttons on one property and all that stuff but if I just touch that there somewhere there see it's gonna be like 40 degrees I stripped the entire

(Start: 00:05:09)
shebang so I can actually see what the hell is going on end up being another screw at the bottom you see a middle piece of the tee holes where they thought were the old in with the new I was just way too sweetie annoyed and just tired to film this so throwing a sparker wheel looks pretty cool do you have one slot this year I'm working I need to make a plan and solder something on so I've just put like one or two screws just holding in the - just full of purpose of this video that's cause I'm going to leave the gear for a while anyway mention the previous one that on the t-top actually see over there I need to respray that there's a couple of months and and Zabriskie this needs to be polished I'm not taking this car until this all sorted Lots need to go back on and that's probably something I will do after the cutting and polish we waste more time not for everyone

(Start: 00:06:11)
yeah a couple things to do I've got a little sublet on throw in the quartz one of those flat ones I'm not sure exactly where I'm gonna mount it maybe behind the seats um do you have quite a bit of space beyond the seats I don't know I'm gonna figure it out I wanted idea this quad want to make a decent and they saw this rod hard it's like one of these videos that I'm not too sure if I'm actually gonna upload just I don't know the length and you know while I'm filming it this is what I'm thinking I'm just being completely real with you guys and just tell you what's on my mind right now if I do it it you probably won't be watching us will you anyway who knows my cup I think I'm done for tonight it's past 9:00 already the wake of the morning long show you that bet

Title: I CANCELLED MYSELF - JDM Overload

(Start: 00:00:00)
I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgment I don't expect to be forgiven I'm simply here to apologize in all seriousness I had a bit of a JDM overload and I needed a bit of time to reevaluate my existence where do I begin I guess let's start with all the good that came by over the last few years I was able to procure some of my favourite JDM cars like the r32 GTR the two rx-7 fd3s and the MRT sw20 I was also able to build a strong following on YouTube and on Instagram bringing the cars and was truly a difficult task but it was also worth it and had a lot of heartbreak and joy that came into my life at the time of procuring these vehicles I was heavily involved in cryptocurrency and it gave me a lot of hope in the wall making me think that I would build a more JDM cars like the Honda in a sixth mystery beast Mitsubishi GTR and many others with the fall of cryptocurrency process in the

(Start: 00:01:01)
rasa JDM car process that became apparent to me that well it would be likely that I wouldn't be able to pick up any more JDM cars this was one of the factors that drove me to mini JD and meltdown if he may call it that the second attribute to my absence would have to be the failing parts and negligence on my end when it comes to working on the cause I expected these cards to be bulletproof due to you well all the hop that's been around them all the YouTube videos out there but they're well aged and the problems do come with the territory most you guys know I spend weeks trying to troubleshoot the silver rx-7 with Jason and the UK and many others that try to help me and it landed up being a load minimal voltage on the leading coil pack end I ran a jumper to that coil pack after 80 from to the battery and the car came alive it just instantly came alive and I was really happy of the whole thing then a week or so later I try to move it to the garage battery was low and a letter flooding my

(Start: 00:02:03)
car again so bleak upset about that whole scenario push the car doesn't feel like you fighting it for the 47th Tom during all the testing and pushed it out and I was ready to get the GTR in the garage the GTR has had a standard plastic radiator which it was doing the job I mean there was nothing wrong my tips were always alone I couldn't complain but at Berger see old and it cracked and it broke now that wasn't a major issue at all the issue was that I purchased a rather large 52 millimeter radiator and was an absolute bollocks foot and I'm not going to deep dive into it but basically had to remove the entire viscous fan setup I had to remove the studs on the water pump remove the pulley off there and make the belt off there remove some of them in cooler purpose I can get to everything and it was just ridiculous it was just I

(Start: 00:03:03)
mean I've seen people just drop in smaller like 42 mile 38 more and radiators and with ease and I made the mistake of going back because I didn't do my research where I worked before anyway it pissed me off I managed to get it done it's in having a chance to enjoy the car but it isn't and there was not other way to do it I had to do it that way much like I explained around the same time I decided to drive the black if d2 to work and I noticed some exterior we're not coming up to stop streets the oil pressure was going down to zero which can only mean bad oil pump and because the motor Matic I can't keep the ribs up at a stop street I have to put it to park or neutral and I mean that's not the way I want to drive the car

(Start: 00:04:04)
they're kind of like added to everything and while all this was taking place the in March she was lying in pieces because I had resprayed a little while ago and I decided well then I was gonna work on everything else before I do the MRT then I had all these issues and I was a bit bleak with everything and at this time already decided I'm gonna be filming cuz a lot back rot up here and it's kind of like I told my frustrations then I decided let me put a limit mechanical stuff like the or examine and GTR everything Asad and actually I'm the Tomlin's a bit wrong here this was in between footing the radiator and also didn't have much time to install it but anyway they more - I got someone to respray it but they didn't do the polishing I was supposed to be doing the polishing I've never done it before my old man was helping me out of that and he gave me some cutting paste you had me

the rod Potter she gave me Jean look like an angle grand a huge one was like a mutton cloth I think that's what you call it and anyway I did the whole wit sanding thing with like 1500 grit offenders with water obviously and fingers came out really good at that the 1500 cut sand then cut then polish came out great then our dead the bonnet and this is yeah they need enough water the water is running down too quickly and I'll scratch that hey buddy tonight static and Tom I cut it then I polished it mouths like it was bad repairable let's see the girl like a 2000 grit then cut it and polish again but the problem is it's time-consuming and this is kind of like be lost draw it's the straw that

broke the camel's back and I genuinely had a JDM breakdown at this stage I cut off all links to social media I ignored all my JDM friends that I've met along the way and I'm really sorry guys I stopped searching for JDM cars and second-hand websites like gum tree OLX etc whatever we've got here locally this was a daily routine for me and it was kind of hard to break but you know cold turkey is the best way to get into an addiction at least what that's what worked for me I deliver nicotine and alcohol addiction at some stage I stopped fearing JDM cars and then I was a distance myself from looking at online paths for Sarah I go through yahoo auctions and I look for HKS parts a pixie greedy you name it and I had to kind of stop all of that I focused my life with family my home myself you know the last two months has been well refreshing and it was much needed after

minutes ago so that's okay something interesting and I think I think this is the fixed to the whole that I've been having the last video we are trying to get the leading plugs working and it was an absolute Bullock one thing I we did is we plugged in the multimedia into we back probe the multimeter into the Quayle harness sticky which is down here somewhere let's go here so see this let's plug in here this is the the harness that comes from the igniter this one and it feeds the whole shebang here I tested recently by pulling everything out of the black box everything Marta and the coil packs throwing them on here the car the same symptoms exactly the same symptoms and yeah anyway so I'll put the black car back together with the parts from here and black house part

black cause 100% so it's not quite X like not it's nothing like that and we didn't thought okay anything could be as harness and why are we on the right path we managed to get the car to start like really light it was like 10:30 Levin and I really I cannot stop this car in the evenings because it's so damn loud but we managed to get a start of the leading only for a couple seconds in a dart out but that's because the plugs were so badly foul from start test or test whatever you want to call it because the chase you see the ignore the yellow green and blue so the brown wire I've run into the positive which comes on ignition only on this honest now what happened before when I haven't the multimeter back probe to it it was getting just under a few voltage so I don't remember the exact figures and I wasn't filming otama probably spit

(Start: 00:03:02)
I think like 79 hours over a two-day period with Jason on video chatting and texting trying to troubleshoot different things so we even pulled out the fuel pump and and whatnot anyway let's just say for the sake of the argument was twelve point nine on the battery it was like twelve point seven six on the on the harness of Tom on ignition then why not crank the car I was getting like seven prints summing volts they're not rotted the different battery I was getting like eight volts when I was cranking that's not rot the black car was doing 12.1 twelve point TV the battery is a little but certainly when I was cranking on the same harness with a backrub so that was interesting what he did is I got the shitty combination of wiring here and the clamp and I was running a drink it's a battery and the car just instantly started sounding but in our neck city and it was able to like tick over that

(Start: 00:04:06)
makes any sense so what does it mean at the another day I think it just wasn't getting enough power something to the harness Furby cuts along the way maybe I broke a door no there's a single sailor maybe it never ran correctly anyway from the beginning who knows cuz I had twin-turbo issues when I first had the car like I hadn't zero power up until about four and a half thousand rpm and and big boom maybe there's nothing wrong maybe this was the issue well I can say right now the leading wasn't working and we filmed film a I'm about to clean the plugs like I said last time they were super fouled actually I'm lying I have a set of plugs yeah yeah they still black but I clean them up and these are the plugs that were in the car for about 150 kilometers maybe this maybe less than that well throw these on now and I'm going to start the car and the sewer

(Start: 00:05:07)
does ransom change the plugs and almost cocked up the whole thing I was about to start the car and holy good thing I remembered I pulled this guy off the turbo which means my lands been free I was trying to get one with a restrictor cuz I read or in some way at Nationals telling me that because of the high oil pressure or exhibits if you well some turbos just tend to smoke a lot and leak oil up the exhaust housing if you're not on even stricter and as you can see is a huge hole now it's just like straight posture so I got this one the little one Mel restrict on it you see that put it up you know is one more strict on this one but it's just like and there was that any sauce that they had in place tonight so I'll draw expresses you have either some old man is gonna take this one and he's in the press of a push into me with a 0.08 inch hole which is known for a thrust bearing

(Start: 00:06:08)
which is 2 millimeter all right guys I'm about to start it just for the sake of arguments there's fresh filmic oil through 10 liters and what else are we on the base map now we're no longer on Sweden Jason's map we managed to get us started on the base map which is impressive because it's a lot richer than Jason's map serella base may have the claw is supposed to run the base map regardless of single twin whatever I've just obviously turn off the twin-turbo control story Leah cracking [Music] holy Sh  amazing

(Start: 00:07:13)
the basemap guys [Music] [Music] [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:09:32)
oh my god I fixed the car oh okay tourists will piss the whale that's gonna yeah it's it's sizzling okay that I can sort out that I'm on the right path I think that restrict the muscle down if not toss the table putting on a GT 35 with a bigger housing Jesus it was this all along don't even need to say anything seriously it's running on leadings it was it was never running on meetings geez okay so if I don't explain Korea is a harness that runs to equipment I did

(Start: 00:10:32)
explain I don't know what I'm really I finally think right now it's connected directly to 12 volt we're gonna connect three get 1200 boosted more coil packs is there any like 8 volts prior to the list the black rx-7 was running like 12 point something and this just wasn't getting so there's obviously an issue here so what I'm gonna do is I've got yeah this will relay and I'm gonna run this relay to a 12 volt source and whatever I'm gonna but I'm gonna run the relay for that piece and the coil packs of an autistic are in the ignition it's a negative for 12 volts I'm just I'm so damn stuck now we're getting somewhere cheese I'm lost for words here it's legitimately running this fibber still smoking it's been about 15 minutes after I picked up the camera I've tried burning Jason on instagram trot for any Russell it's a Sun that not just like 8 o'clock at night nobody's gonna pick up

(Start: 00:11:33)
their phone now anyway but I'm just so excited I just wanted to tell somebody I'm telling you guys so I'm expressing my excitement here are the dev things running just so cool so now I can reconnect my trailing I'm looking up the wires I wanna clean up these HT leads I do want to get some magma cause but the car is working of proving that it works on all of these now I'll swap please are the black car swap the back of a whole bunch of stuff in well I'm pretty confident it's inside that was sort of no I didn't a sort of smoke eater but I really hope it's just very strict up I don't know if it needs one but I am gonna and get that sorted out it's like legit pissing oil down onto the manifold but the next thing maybe tomorrow not I want to come in put the battery back in the trunk or the boot so yeah I have the stock vocation with zero gauge I've got two

(Start: 00:12:36)
gauge right in the back and then the ground balls using a stock grounding cable and I added an additional ground over there and there's an additional ground on the bottom that I ran as well so I just want to put it back like better you look at like how it's supposed to be start the carpet you know leading this work yes cool but for sure it's gotta be that because the battery's been in the front for like three weeks different tests couldn't get a guy and then 15 up with my ship because I I've been pulling stuff up and putting it back on lifting you I am like one of these are not top okay yeah this relish at the back not taught I know that's not on yeah can you sort this out but it's running on the basement which is well I'll be in touch soon I'll give you guys some feedback Jeremy on Instagram I'll try updated in the day up to go from there Gus thank you so much see you next one

Title: Rx7 FD3S Ignition problems - Troubleshooting
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TknpYbZQAo4

(Start: 00:00:00)
sup girls welcome back to the vlog I have some some good and bad news on rx-7 FD I was doing some troubleshooting with Jason in the UK actually let's start from the beginning there's three shifts and I know too many ships then birds you guys never saying too many chefs blah blah what's happened is you may have seen some comments in my previous video where I fixed the FT when I was able to read over 3k Jason from the UK 3 Jason's to Jason's Jason in the UK Jason and Sweden and then Gavin Bay tech runs Bay Tech the gara the honda swapped 50k something k24 i think all three have been helping me and gavin beta ik dropped a comment on my previous video saying well I sent you a map with the split timing etc what's the deal why the

(Start: 00:01:00)
network to be brutally honest I learned it on the car I taste the car I had pretty much the same sometimes I couldn't rip a 3k it felt the same at the time but I also had issues with no idle speed controller when I did load the map and I didn't have a whole lot of other crap that was going wrong that I land up fixing so I was troubleshooting mostly with Jason and Sweden and Jason in the UK we've had enough in troubleshooting like almost on a daily basis almost chatting on a daily basis so I decided let me get back to Jason's map and Jason the UK did some tweaks but Tommy attend it was the same as Gavin Bay tix Tommy anyway so no offense to you Gavin please I'm trying to just fix the car and I appreciate every single person's help that being said I've been doing some homework with Jason in the UK and

(Start: 00:02:02)
we pulled the plugs the plug beads on the trailing report trailing quills which there's one over there there's one over there I pulled those out earlier and then I started a car and I'll show you guys the video credit get other than that deafening backfire the car wouldn't start at all it was completely dead you heard it in the video but anyway what does that mean means my leading is not working at all what I'm gonna be doing now super boring

(Start: 00:03:03)
again and I'm gonna show you a little video I'm gonna be pulling out my new I am lifting it up which I've done like a million times and on the blog and then I'm gonna be pulling out the coil pack so I'll do that in video and pulling out the leads if I can get to there I will be able together let's go so I'm doing a awkward

(Start: 00:04:23)
 those two I aim is off and I just need to figure out these coil packs and alright so there's a horse that Jason sit on you take off who am i avoiding for you there is a harness and Houston camo is an electrical harness yeah that's got a blue plug a white one all sort of black one don't we the third quail peckers where are you done yeah strange anyway we'll take these guys out figure out what's going on I mean it should be pretty straightforward just felt something very interesting here but before I show you shame I've got both dogs in hadn't gotten here in the background there's a whole lot of fireworks going on it's some celebration called Diwali I

(Start: 00:05:27)
thought it was tomorrow I didn't get the dogs they're calming tablets and all of its nearby are closed so they stuck me with me which already done mind share something interesting just got off the phone Jason we're busy troubleshooting I'm going to be pulling out all these coil pegs there's only three coil packs in this car I find um because I was very confusing I'm like where's the fourth coil pack help me this is trailing one trailing two leading one and leaving two it actually uses two HT leads that powers 2 HT leads and then looks odd something interesting here you probably won't see it but here's a white plug which goes into trailing 1 and there's actually a watch sticker see a little sticker there it says trailing 1 and this one's got a blue sticker that says trailing 2 blue plug black l1 l2 which I've been walking anyway so I'll just

(Start: 00:06:27)
need to mark one of each and then I know exactly what I'm there now you're putting them out now I'm going to be putting out the HT leads to and then testing and then I'll probably get something like magna cause for the FD I don't even know if they make Megan of course of the FT another deer for the 132 GTR but I'll probably do some coils but it all makes sense now the car was dying l1 and l2 the beatings on a firing properly they're not firing it over I'm gonna pull the trailing out the card out so I can you saw that video so I'll pull these out and then we're gonna do some testing and get to the bottom of this I want this call we're hanging I wanna be driving this car freakin bug on my neck all right I gotta go keep the dogs company and pull this stuff out ok it was a first thing I'm doing this is the harness that was powering these guys remember I showed you I think it was that way and this harness this big plug was connected this is that at the bottom I'm gonna be

(Start: 00:07:29)
doing a quick continuity test with my multimeter so I managed to get continuity on one two on the watt one two on the blue but I only got continuity on one on the black let me try this again that's the first point straight away [Music] sham I feel so bad for these dogs okay mr. data it's really liking that was the problem okay it's not that honest what continuity bonus is good but I'll leave

(Start: 00:08:32)
it up for now hands off both the early got the leading coil pack autumn buddy doing some image testing and also bugging Jason hold on just beginning here tear with me I've pulled up the specs from FD if you guys can see this so here is that one that's the leading that's what I'm working with right now this one and it says a B primary coil winding below one I'm and then L 1 l 2 secondary coil winding between 1.6 and 16 for dirt tests I think I'm doing this right I did after YouTube I'll be honest on how to give us and for the test we can hearty winging

(Start: 00:09:40)
every single thing and really just don't waking across a few years ago what our banners have put that into there and I'm gonna put the other end unto fear and you see that 16 point 56.57 so looks like assistance pick sham it's been about an hour and these dogs are freaking out this dog try to climb in through my cupboard and broke my shelf my shelf is now diagonal I had to barricade it up break the doors everything just so she doesn't go in here she's busy hottie in the corner knocked over all this crap shame they're really rare thing are these fireworks I'm filthy again but we getting to the bottom of it this is a leading pack the leading coil that's out we've been doing a whole bunch of testing and the plug leads okay I've been getting 7 point 5 to 8 kilo ohms on each one so testing point to point from here to there from

(Start: 00:10:42)
there to there and that's been fun then the continuity testing on the scar test this this wasn't within spec with the if the manual that was like between 9/16 I think I'd show you guys in this vlog and remember between 9 and 16 I tasted it was well within spec and then we plugged it all in and tested again we added everything up so you have to add up numbers and it gives you like between 25 and 30 ohms all together and set it up which is rot everything is within spec which means everything's workin continuities their image is there everything's right the only thing I can be left from the side is the ECU plug maybe my harness is an issue and I've been trading that so I'm going to do is I'm gonna pop this open really disconnect my battery I'm gonna pull the plugs all for the ECU down there luckily everything's really up and I'm

(Start: 00:11:44)
gonna be testing one continuity to image between thus plug now this is the plug that connects that HT lead thing the coil pack whatever connects up all the coil packs test that back to the ECU I'm not exactly filming all this because I'm lacking space here garages and the mess and well I like procrastinating now I'm just I'm also busy on the phone with Jason he's been a huge help came to the gerotor like 60 percent battery on my phone or not 20 let's get cracking pull the ECU harness thing off a pixie yeah started working on my pen out but I left that for a second I thought maybe this could be the issue pull the igniter out still talking to Jason at the same time igniter sits over here pull Danada

(Start: 00:12:46)
out and I've been testing all the pins back and how is testing it is this plug that goes to the coil packs the same here goes leading testing continuity from there to ignore igniter harness plug and then I was also just tasting the image and everything seems wasn't so I guess we got to go back to the ECU now see if the actual main ECU wiring harness is a issue that's pretty much the last thing I can test men really battling yeah at least I know now it's definitely something wrong with mission I'm just going to work it out figure out my ignition control because I didn't get a chance to make an inning to that video but it's two days it's gone past now yesterday I went to go start to cause the leading plugs leading plugs in like I've done and like I showed you

(Start: 00:13:46)
guys in the beginning of the video and the car never started before at all it was completely dead on leading other than that big back father to give and the car started it started straight away it ran like absolute donkey it sounded like I was running on one writer I confirmed with Jason did sound like it was running on one writer I spoke to other Jason in Sweden he also agrees one writes a I think miss here are the leads and the wiring something must have been loose I've got a feeling it was the one pluggy that was going into the coil pack you know I remember surely leading coil packs got two things one of them must have been out anyway it's where that it started didn't sound great one rotor the cause for sure flooded it's like super flow because remember I was also testing it with the bleeding and trailing out and there wasn't starting blah blah hundred-percent flooded I pull the plugs

(Start: 00:14:47)
out now quicker than hope for the best see what happens well here's more plugs definitely all fouled up I'm looking them up quick throw them back in the car oh hang on I'm going to clean them up I'm going to pull the EGR fuse D flood the car or the plugs are and then throw them back in all of a sudden got very stinky in here for a few nervous something interesting

(Start: 00:15:54)
trailing plugs those guys a lot less filed in leading plugs that's better nice and clean okay guys just lost the Wi-Fi can started four five minutes she said yes my daughter's asleep she's probably on the wake up and I'm gonna have a shitty not a good wicks before I started it goes I I was up in the air hmm I won't if it's safe for me to stir them yeah let me tell you girls the importance for us if it starts on the leading it means I would have fixed everything Oh God unplug the battery again let's

(Start: 00:16:57)
try this again come on no way to look what do you guys want to see look at that he picks you all started alright guys thanks for watching little bleak about the situation really really thorough as you know work I guess I gotta stop putting parts of the black car try on out check the resistance and all that on the coil pack and maybe move the coil pack from the black one here move the igniter move the leads because we know for sure the black one works what there's gonna be a happy ending

(Start: 00:17:57)
anyway thanks everyone see y'all next video please

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys welcome to the vlog I'm gonna pitch the MRT to a monkey just been resprayed out and told you guys finally been reached Oh a little while to get it done when mentioning in a whole lot of videos that that was my plan so the problem is we just had a wither warning saying if there's gonna be severe health hailstorms and there's also severe downpour rainfall whatever they Morty doesn't have a front bumper at the moment the bumper got resprayed but I haven't put everything back on only a fit should bring into the carport here put the rx-7 the black rx-7 and my parents place serve up allotting will get better on a thick I'm gonna give it two minutes before put

(Start: 00:01:00)
it in reverse GT I was there actually I want to check the oil real quick through in front of the garage ready [Music] [Music] it's Costco stock and actually works this thing yeah whoops you missed the last video gonna cleanse eye-popping so check a little quick kill the second sick one eternity later not bad chop it up 100 moles

(Start: 00:02:08)
yeah oils good when you done like 400k since I changed the oil probably not even holy how's that for it guess and I don't even notice it 399 kilometers since I've owned this car [Music] a lot by the way say what's in here later follow my Instagram you ready now fellowship we got cops I'm good

(Start: 00:03:13)
[Music] get lattes pretty bad yeah but yeah bonus when respray the fenders oven respray i basically had the front of the car East bridge from a pillar all the way to the front the back was actually fun couple little scratches like - tough little touch-up I have to do on here see that and I was like that when I bought the car just need to touch that up everything else is fine on the court obviously Diddy and sitting outside but damn good job it's got a little bit of that orange peel effect I just need to do the whole polish then world stuff I mean what you're seeing on the phone it's drizzling and whatnot I'm gonna swap places looking at is the bumper a little bit of concern now because I left the look for the bumper on top here

(Start: 00:04:16)
and I thought that all around the corner okay I'm very concerned [Music] I'm such a tool I was here for my birthday a couple days ago and I put the thing here inside the car completely forgot about it lock covers on the seats it's very good a damn good job now what I need to do and want bring it back home I need to do all the paperwork here see that that's rust on this crash ball in the front really mana hasn't eaten into anything if you look at that it's just see if it's rust someone sawed all of that stuff out peanut panels and whatnot it should be good and then obviously throw everything back on and I think what I'm going to do is

(Start: 00:05:20)
probably get some lowering springs or some pretty basic willows it'll be a cooler can call one sister well the three of us ones our friends will dish it up I'm going to take that mount no scratching but that's Katie and then he started to voice thoughts not either [Music] watch out laggy these things are my switch them off 1 2 3 they quick to come up lets car I'll show you quickly before we move it what's up quick this is

(Start: 00:06:20)
No Theatre exhausts start standard damn look at those taillights out as on most of us here I think my precious cinder you know those dead or dying when I'm not in drive it's down to zero almost there they're not put it on drive up to a decent speed like 20 it's about between 2 and 4 bar on this pressure gauge [Music]

(Start: 00:07:25)
this one's Lots work old arts work I must say for the cheapest car it's one the most fun - the most reliable it's got a watch and throwing like II hid lights on there [Music] let's go 12 seconds later all right you guys need a full of Manchester gram everybody else knows my special it's a radiator for the r32 GTR Elementium radiator from one on our 32 GTR at the moment which is your normal recoil thank plastic tank clanging standard once they're on once I fixed the intercooler pops of the boost pops in the front Winfred drop with Gareth everything is good except there needs to recalibrate

(Start: 00:08:25)
my boost controller because the pop diameter is slightly different and then everything is fun with the hard pops in you how it pops when I got back a pocket cut off everything is fine sit good not too Gareth next morning I put the garage door water everywhere radiator shed itself it's old it's twenty or twenty seven years old sand whatever well got anyone school we're gonna do an install video on a today's winding an install of that of a cash can to do there's so much stuff some stuff of those cars or I'm supposed to be troubleshooting this car with Jason from the UK you guys saw my last video but busy busy busy with everything else it's like 7 o'clock Ian I need because they become as corner anyway I'm gonna sign off thank you so much for watching it's the next one peace

Title: How I "Fixed" the 3k RPM hesitation on my RX7 FD
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3dh09LwI68

(Start: 00:00:00)
what up good people we're gonna be working on this thing alright 7fd I'm gonna be doing this little Joyner pop on compensation pop yes they call this compensation pop I don't know why joinha on there so this needs to be shortened quite a bit will come up to like yeah and then this will connect on there you guys get the idea I'm gonna for you of that what I did want to talk to you guys about is if you follow my Instagram you were seeing that I was able to river this car past 3000 rpm here's our dinner I wasn't intending on that same abusing the car I wasn't intending on fixing an issue all I did was I set up the camera

(Start: 00:01:01)
well I set up my cell phone I was just going to make a random Instagram video and I set up my camera and I said it's record and as soon as I started this car I just put my foot down store revving it no mechanical sympathy whatsoever just win for it and I was like holy it shot right past 5k I think I'm thing I mean I've like fought in half in the first rib he doesn't see the video now [Music] [Music] I mean you go see that I was able to react wah dah I then I went past that I

(Start: 00:02:01)
went to like seven and a half thousand rpm Oh what I realized you can only do this when the car is called what does it mean well of course call me there's a lot more fuel compensation or whatnot in the map I'm not of China so what that means is it's something to do with the chin possibly but until I read you what Jason from the UK had to say about the whole thing and we think we may be about to fix everything excuse that onion finish that up I might do some to not do some little gold stuff see I'm getting star trekt ready what are we talking about 3k rpm story now Jason the UK sent me a message a lot of messages and I'm gonna run through some of the messages in our party and now the first thing I need to tell you guys is that now the first thing I tell you guys is that I did run

(Start: 00:03:02)
through a bunch of tests with Jason I did my vacuum testing I did I did a whole bunch of testing of them and one of them that we were like really concerned about was my resistor for the fuel pump and the fuel pump resistor it basically just sports for emissions control back in the day it runs the fuel pump and man thought for a while and then it kicks back in and yeah anyway I bought pasta and I was getting actually remember the numbers thirteen point six thirteen point seven volts and so what if my alternator was giving out and yeah slow the samishii now every time I've tested the car voice tasted that I've warmed it up I've gotten a pass like 67 degrees 70 degrees warmed up nasty and then basically beat the out of and always had that 3k RPM limiter except for this tongue because I was having a bad day and I'm solid Florida and I was like holy crap okay it's got to be starting the map so

(Start: 00:04:04)
Jason then sent me a bunch of mates just my camera life's flashing red I want to put this on charge be back with you in a sec and I'll be back from the battery charge this is sorted cut back a little bit of meat on that pop like that much job but I'll clean that up with a big file it's on the band is on everything's nice and secure I'm actually digging this Maya must set up that I had I had a stupid compensation pop over there that I chopped up and then I tried plastic welding myself and what I did with the plastic welding is I came like straight and then went head-on to here they accept the plastic welding kind of didn't hold up after taking the compensation palpable five six seven eight nine times rather leave the stock went on or get a greedy elbow couldn't be asked to the greedy aware this is perfectly fun I don't think it's gonna make much difference whether you get a

(Start: 00:05:05)
grittier better than it looking cool and to be honest I've got to spend money on a lot more other important things they're even good English yeah before I stopped buying video better than so what Jason says yeah he says if it's not fueled and has to be recognition related then I said to well why did this work a while ago I remember I had this issue with the twin turbos when I first got the car and I said some whether to work went up through the a pixie power FC on off the trying every single thing and he said the stock right from the PFC had a split close to zero which meaning of trailing would have meant it would have fired close to where the leading should be firing in the vacuum area of your timur map he had a split of 15 which is way too much for vacuum and if the leading isn't firing you've got super  if trailing only map that'll explain the blowing manifold at idle a lot of people have been telling me

(Start: 00:06:06)
you're Tommy's often that's why the metaphors been glowing that was the one so he adjusted the map this is if it makes any difference then I need to swap out the leading coil only and he wouldn't bother going back to the other map because most people run a serous split in vacuum anyway they're split and vacuum will make you call a more responsive wind not and boost quo would mean it is for a while con stop the cart enormous still to your loud I'm gonna buy one of those actuator valve flippy things to put an exhaust because I really really can't start the car at not my daughter just my god I mean my girls are pretty damn far away from the house but sorry I'm in Faro from her bedroom but it's just too loud anyway we're gonna fire up the old laptop I get the FC haka

(Start: 00:07:08)
out which is over here with a bunch of blitz pots if you see Hawker if you're wondering where the FG hukka is it's the same as the datalogger if see Datalog it and another brown note and what we gonna do I'm gonna plug this into the a pixie charging my battery just in case it all brings me my my map that I'll carry got a load on the car and now I'll let my the map or Jason's in me that should be it no because this bring up if she edit again I read from I see a

(Start: 00:08:09)
yep same one I got cool so I've written to my EC you know and I've open your map on top girls not the end of the video it's the next day mixed evening I'm gonna start wickley daughters asleep she's in a deep sleep oh my give us a shot I've got like five minutes to do this I'll pretty much immediately be able to tell if the cars running bet honor yes so now every three hours coming that's not tops because of okay  wasn't exactly well prepared for this I should lift a laptop logging

(Start: 00:09:18)
howdy hell always my luck I left the door open come on kill the battery so I'll just pull this battery out of the out of the r32 GTR should be back in business now though so we don't get to smack down no we me straightaway lacrosse

(Start: 00:10:43)

Title: RX7 FD3S Efini Steering Wheel Change
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS1EFHC6Ig4

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome back to the garage I'm going to be doing a steering wheel change in the rx-7 fd3s Jason and the UK I know if you're watching this I'm sorry he's given me a map to load onto the a pixie supposed to do an art con start the car right now hmm I'm unloaded I'm gonna do another video I'm probably going to come back tomorrow during the day it took some time for it and then get this thing still not anyway that's not are you doing that right now we're gonna be changing the horrible Momo big wheel with this this is a nice neat if knee will that cam and some of the rx-7 models I'm actually not familiar which models are camera because both Mon I haven't done meaning steering little research but both Amon have this wheel which is big and ugly especially the centerpiece there is an air bag in it that's coming out I'm going to do that right now this is not gonna be a

(Start: 00:01:00)
step-by-step video this is just gonna be me doing my thing because I haven't done any research on how to change it guessing it's common sense just connect the battery first missing some pieces do you have some carpets here and either on I swapped these carpets with Russell I just need a wash and it's gonna have the battery I did see it was a tin on the steering wheel a 10 millimeter not a spin I don't have to use a socket with an extension I get a chance while I'm in here I've put up another shelf that one in the corner I'm happy to do another ray of not happening I'm gonna do another rope shelving up to like the air Plus smallest okay house the first thing I found this these two little tabs some we have there you go see this little plastic tab that thing pops out there's nothin on this side and then you got a

(Start: 00:02:02)
ten millimeter hit on that please be a 10-millimeter I'm taking I guess that's the 110 millimeter sorry you guys review of my hairy legs I'm gonna put the camera down for this one those two bolts that I'll just tuck off loosens the a bag these not explode my face don't explode in my place okay the old air bag unit I'm gonna disconnect this very carefully with the camera here I guess if it first shuts off and hit me enough Oh stomach right now make for

(Start: 00:03:04)
good content oh my god Jesus huh whoa cuz if you will a little bit different your mom's got a little tabs on the side this doesn't let's just got this number 10 on here you know pay for the noise you never have this will know for about five months I would installed so much shipping on my life I don't tell you guys everything in the future okay okay so that piece has been cut off for easy to tell me that he needs to cut it off that's for the horn and let's figure out which one it is on Mon and then put this guy back on

(Start: 00:04:04)
otherwise this looks looks to be the same honey two hands cameras getting down what movies hold on here and then under and take the wheel up with other owner had a quick google cuz it was a little bit stumped of summer I pull this nut off it actually is a twenty one wiggle the wheel left rot up down blah blah and it will come out I'm gonna be doing that right now alright I got it off wid over to us don't try and bash it I was trying to bash it from the back and then I was even considering getting that rubber mallet is hanging there bashing it but knife don't do that literally just wiggle it left rut would lift right like a an initial pop out this wiring is very different so I don't figure this all out quickly alright the a bag thing would sit on this one this is the standard wheel I push yeah that would be the horn push there that would be the horn now this is a single wire for this wheel which is

(Start: 00:05:09)
over here which remember that this is just the horn you see this little horn button ah that's the horn I'm gonna have to rewire though somehow figure out which one is the horn probably that one I don't know try to do this as neat as possible and I don't to cut the connections that are on they on that back well on here is a plug see a blue plug is hanging it I don't want to cut that off at all but all of it is I'm gonna figure out which of those three there's like little connector thing is it is the horn and then I'm gonna put a little Spade connector on the end of this car and just plug it only and that's pretty good that's your work and that should be pretty now the way I'm going to do this is I'm going to hold down horn and I'm going to

(Start: 00:06:11)
touch this on each one of them and see which one doesn't block the car and hopefully Hung Hom okay spike connectors on let's like this end if it fits thank God okay how awesome that works with you dudes all the way thing and just push it through but there's not enough space in this wheel so either our cut here which I'm Joaquin I'm cutting the wheel so this guy can cut actually maybe I should it's just Tonya month all right somehow I managed to get it to

(Start: 00:07:11)
fit I might have cut the wheel and anyway I'm just gonna figure out the position because stop filming at that point and I actually took the wheel or not forgot which way I was placing the wheel that looks about straight that's on I mean it's a pretty simple job never done before so I couldn't make it look easy on the camera so 21 millimeter yeah and then what you gonna do to get it nice and soft pull the wheel out and get this

(Start: 00:08:28)
[Music] yeah yeah wheel out and then remember I made that so in theory that should just like straight on that's a super ass hot that will fit somewhere inside yeah and then the steering wheel find up - hip and bump it that goes in like that and it should eat honk whatever you guys wanna call it these work yeah okay cool last thing to do there's a 10 millimeter bolt that goes right at the bottom and

(Start: 00:09:29)
I'm done I'm gonna end the video here hopefully that camera angle worked Turner and then a damn what a transformation oh that's it for the video guys thank you so much for watching really appreciate the views if you don't subscribe to channel peace hit subscribe or hit the like button if you loved the video hit the subscribe button if you liked it hit like button also thank you so much see y'all next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different and you must be kidding think you're gonna hate me but just don't get it it's impossible it's a problem irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the tones you gotta take as though you can't be your proto what you have no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it [ __ ] to you for these opinions that all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen that [ __ ] is on fiction

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] [Music] Oh somehow a popular North Coast newspaper ran an article in me I've only got one person thinks of us and that is even be a photography thank you so much this is like she gets better just by the bar this is yet further about beer productions anyway so three even wrote a really cool

(Start: 00:01:01)
half page article on my GTR there's actually a another online link to this I'll put in the description and looks like go whole bunch more pictures and whatnot here it's pretty damn cool I got into the newspapers a huge shout out to North Coast Korea or even for running the article Gareth will taking the further really cool okay actually had a whole bunch of follows just pick up on my Instagram and my youtube a couple people asking me questions on how to import these cars always happy to help wherever I can thank you for the support now going into the whole social media thing where am I mean they're like three ish weeks and supposed to so I gotta be a little bit honest about some things one I've been highly highly addicted to playing apex legends and when it's not epic sessions just need to share a key yeah I can't help myself laughing I've got

(Start: 00:02:03)
back-to-back gaming sit up obviously two computers mods nothing special SAR seven 4790k with a 1066 gig if that makes sense to anybody watching whose is a little bit less spec and yeah yeah we enjoying playing games together and it's something different now but kind of hooked with that that's not the only reason I got a little despondent three weeks ago you got stole the video driving this car I went out with Russell I went with Gareth and we're smashing it a bit and although I hi I'm happily went to kill a pop off again and yeah bumpers off this pod is the culprit blow from here today well the strangest thing and please excuse the mess I've been doing everything other than correlated and Geraldine up as much needed here's the old pop it's just too short

(Start: 00:03:06)
for some reason it's like this weird rubber it's not silicon like this this is the new one and I'm gonna be extending that it just doesn't clip on anymore it's so strange like for example let's say the in tequila poppers over here it'll only maybe just get onto about there so it's not enough meat to actually hold onto it so strange I don't know maybe just put all the others old it's like 20 something years old it's 25 years actually 26 years it's gotten brittle and old and stretchy I don't even I'm lost for waste anywhere what's in me a pop will be running that there and then this guy and the straight piece with some beading that is the plan I'm gonna be doing that maybe all that now I don't know that's one of the updates on it to show you guys the other update is about some parts that have started coming through for the actually

(Start: 00:04:07)
for quite a few of the cause anyway something that I'm busy planning on doing is my wife was kind enough to buy me a pretty oil catch tank I think it's a fake one but I mean really all it does is just catch oil from the crankcase it's innocent somewhere like us I need a deal why delete yeah tidy up all this crap here it's at somewhere like that and then what I'm gonna do is a really basic setup where this will be venting to atmosphere and then I'm going to have a long pop coming with here to there and then I'm just gonna block off I've brought some stuff to block with the intake side so for example I need block off the crankcase push up okay these are wrong see this more you get the idea these are feet for like chairs and tables and stuff so I've bought

(Start: 00:05:10)
different sizes that'll block those holes that's cool that's one of the things I'm doing so good it will catch tank what else will this car ooh yeah you guys want to see this you guys remember we I had my a pixie holder and my HK SAE BC and all that stuff well I wasn't happy with positioning so you looking at a picture right now of what it used to look like this is what it looks like now how cool is that so I made this little backing out of Mason art wrapped it around my HKS EBC what I call display HK ICBC five controller my apex E power C is now mounted over there it's on an original a pixie holder it's like when I was be anyone's you see that flatten us to actually put the mold on

(Start: 00:06:12)
still got these weird power stages and you sort that out fortunately it goes away when you're driving but interesting look cool I mean that's like super oh yeah that's needs to go so this is it for interior Momo steering wheel boost gauge red - red little cluster thing either HKS units working clock someone pointed a hoof to me on instagram it's a very rare that you have a working clock no stop 3:00 in the morning it's actually I don't know what the time is I think it's like saving daddy whatever yeah I'll show you guys this is the new look it's like a new OEM top look I got more space yeah that a pixie hanging I wasn't cool the other bits I like it I like it it's really really cool so I want to change this up that did the seats on stage or what they say about five-point harness in the car their interiors looking a lot better I'm just fixed up damn pretty cool

(Start: 00:07:15)
please pop work once and forever buddy annoying the rx-7 is so fun I've got this - my fuel pressure regulator that needs to go in the car this Wilber 320 that needs to go on the car also need to do a resistor fill pampers to bypass I've can't just parking away I mean it's it actually got a wash yesterday watch them and yeah was Easter Saturday I go to Washington Saturday I saw the black one this one isn't gonna wash because it's broken in the garage anyway so they're not neglected they they are next door in the carport it's just the turbo seals are definitely blind and I'm like rotted despondent about that we're all the bleakness course breaks but I mean this one was a fairly easy job so now so once the turbos repaired and all that then I will throw the fuel pressure in it out on the wall bro and I've got this

(Start: 00:08:15)
if you will that needs to go on take out that other my motor wheel with the a bag which is rather big and then hopefully you get that car back up and running I don't know what I'm gonna do with the turbo though that it's either rebuild see if I can find some brand new core here some sort of rebuild kit if not then I may go for like a GT 35 I don't know I don't know what to do but anyway the first thing is get the boys back here for Friday not session and pull the manifold off I need to wrap it - it's all strapped over there well you wrap another hole urgentiy because it's like blowing grid that's pretty much it that's update other than that not much else have been going on been working on the house Spain lost on the family and playing computer games yeah but I think I think I think I'm back let's see what happens I'm gonna play let's call for a

(Start: 00:01:00)
that's out of the world the UK as well so I kind of forgot to pick up the camera and film we've been trying to figure out this this pack it's a bit weird I've already got a I've already got wiring in here that matches this is my stock wiring that comes in from a 12-volt source and here's the big Messer who's been pulling out now comes into the 12 volt source from my car that's just the wiring already head goes into the ballast from the ballast out to the lot then there were these two and I'll show you on here there were these two spades there's a spade connected here and a spy cake there that goes to this plug we don't know what it does but we don't need it because I just plugged in the two that we thought that we needed this is my original laughs these other one stupid-ass brought looks like I actually got the rod colors that looks like 8,000 k so we're gonna throw it and tidy up the wiring I'm going to change this bulb

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] what's up guys and welcome back to another video I'm trying to follow miss video for ages now probably about a month I'm just having that time to strap a GoPro on to the GTR and go and do some pops and bangs I'm about to dirt now before we begin I wanna show you what's in the garage if you've been following the last two videos you'll notice that my silver are excellent has gone to rustic and he's building your down pop and doing a whole bunch other cool stuff so I've got the black ft yeah finally I don't think it's actually being in this garage ever pretty crazy give it a decent run yesterday didn't almost but I've spent some quality time with the collar no cameras no cameras on me there's a bit of work that needs to be done I need to put back all the interior

(Start: 00:01:01)
but they're all in pieces all over the place because nothing else remember I was pulling out this dent over here a little while ago six seven months ago Aaron Connie it's a little bit of TLC and I'm gonna give it to not in this video this is all about GTR so let's go GTR is there on the cover let's put knuckles for about two weeks or so I took a mark - that's gonna get sanded and then sprayed because also in need of a lot of TLC with regards to paintwork probably the worst car but I actually have Lexus is the neatest obviously funny enough that's my daily GTR those are pretty neat it does plasti duct pasty there participating not fading us getting like swirl marks that I can take out and random crap yeah they look after sometimes Park ever pretty much over time probably see it

(Start: 00:02:07)
maybe no tiny able scratches and stuff all over the place you see that may rip the plastic lip off soon cause silver underneath you guys wondering what's underneath it was over the paint works okay it was a little bit of issue where I've scratched the front of his car for the week before when tested them drove into a war did you park in the garage and I didn't judge the distance it's cause different you're not gonna start I'll show you why my battery remember the battery went flat Alexis kind of stole the battery

(Start: 00:03:08)
yesterday I went out and bought a brand new one 639 amp whoa no 613 on saws battery whatever that means and it's a 60 amp hour battery 12 volt now it's pretty good my name brand I'm not gonna threat Bosh's and all that stuff in five different cars that I don't drive so I know name-brand Rattray's alright guys microphone is in the GoPro setup I'm gonna let pass Nelson to tell you exactly what's going on and why are we doing this video okay I'm gonna go take the car to my parents place because if I do it here my neighbors are gonna [ __ ] England plane my parents one neighbor is completely deaf and the others were really far away so noise in here thing she starts

(Start: 00:04:09)
really damn cold outside sitting just under 2,000 rpm at the moment I'm gonna let it warm up and then hit the road okay we just arrived in my parents place neighbors hopefully deaf and I've warmed up a little bit one focus doesn't seem to be leaving the 68-69 mark of an oddly in the car for about ten minutes now plus - so that's probably as good as we're gonna get with it being about eleven twelve degrees outside so the first one are we going to be doing on here is anti leg and I'm going to call it the poor man's anti leg because obviously this doesn't have as many features as an all ECU it is old remember this you know came out like 1996 money five something like that so it's old-school it is a lot cheaper it's about fifteen sixteen thousand rand okay so the first thing you want to do for anti leg is you want to go through two settings and then the first option is

(Start: 00:05:10)
your RG in map go into your Archean map and this first table l 0 1 you know sit over there 220 right what this does is basically when you're doing gear changes it's going to give you a nice big pop and a flame so what's going to happen when that was all set to zero the air flow meter is going to basically drop its air when the throttle body closes so the airflow meter basically drops into this load zone for a split second now doesn't happen all the time but pretty close like ninety five percent of the time when you're doing a gear change I get these annoying sparks here sorry off topic but turbo time I just got a little bit of wild power Sparks I mean anyway load zero so you're gonna set this all to zero when you're changing gears you should hear a nice big pop and a flame not to do that let's just go back to the beginning you're gonna go through settings the ignition map you know go to each cell and you know change that down

(Start: 00:06:17)
to zero degrees Tommy see like that so left rot push next next again until you get to the value and then on to zero degrees so you see it's going up in increments of 400 so if I go to the next one 1600 so does 800 1200 1600 push next go down here set it down to zero and you're gonna keep going all the way to the end right that's up so in 20s you're lost table I remember if you use the FC Hakone FC data logger this is a lot simply just click and drag l01 changeable to zeroes hit enter so basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to pump this all up to 5,000 now in theory I haven't tried this one before we're about to figure it out but in theory this should sit my launch control to 5,000 and I should get a whole bunch of flames coming out so it's gonna keep dumping fuel while I'm

(Start: 00:07:21)
driving the car but only at zero cares now [Music]

(Start: 00:08:29)

I'll swap the rx-7 into the carport because with some damage on the earth ETO after doing this video but we'll fix it on another one and I'm not gonna fix it today how's this someone was filming behind me and I figured I'd show so I hit it quite hard and risky and open intercooler pop popped off but a popped off it's the bottom one there it goes yeah so this thing this one here goes underneath you'll see a thing and I actually sort through yeah anyway the big insecure pop kind of just popped off and then made a little bit of damage the plastic from the bumper lost it screws obviously hit quite hard it was a massive explosion I think I quoted all unform on the GoPro I don't know we'll check mark enough now here I'm gonna put this car in the garage luckily

(Start: 00:10:30)
had happened just under a kilometer away from home so it was mostly downhill so I'll limp the car all the way here the thread in the garage go ahead up this video damn other than the boost pops popping off it's caused an absolute demon 450-horsepower which means love it absolute beast crazy sounds it's making up that map I've got it switching on AC so the video that you actually saw from the past have made a couple of changes since then and it doesn't have to make those noise all the time who actually got the wrong way around when the icons on they seized on it makes all the pops and bangs to be the other way around I need to fix that and then okay pretty cool I can activate it whenever I want you know I hope you enjoy the video cos that's crazy you know what I figured if I didn't do it now it wouldn't even happen so strip

there was a mercedes-benz like not a recent one like a 2013 ish and he came up behind me sort of flashed me to me as I'm doing whatever on the freeway just cruising so again I put into sport mode cuz I'm drowning order and Florida get pushed of threats move into the left lane did came flying past me 500 playing as I'm in the wrong place gave me an ass-whipping anyway we're here we're gonna play cause now there's a 13 in the background which is big P I smell yeah cooking it a feature that he's on the way to super drift no Iraq has my car I haven't seen it in two weeks it's been like she's been quite nauseous like me in the garage and seeing a GTR and said oh this thing versus our excite other rx-7 in the background but we have full RX Evans here today one rx-8 I forgot to mention what are we actually

(Start: 00:04:06)
doing in today we're going to be finishing the exhaust getting that down pop and mid pops without once that's done rust is going to be reading some of the brackets in circular sod and we should be pretty much good to go the corner flatbed and ring back on her feet while the in this video you'll hear the car running on the awesomely exhausting [Music] Russ was kind enough to organize one of these for me it's a little flicks joined the other valid points and something I didn't think about was if I did a straight pop all the way to the back with no flicks and for example I had to reversed into a wall it would push the exhaust all the way back to the turbo and obviously I caused some damage on this end I don't want that we got to put the flicks in the middle somewhere in the middle and if you hit something at least that's gonna get the [ __ ] and not the server not the manifold nor anything

(Start: 00:05:07)
else you know what we're gonna be doing is there was this little V bench dictionary here Russell's got it nice busy cutting and we gonna turn that down color she's cutting up the saws right now and then cut my back box her a couple my den pop so this down pop was actually cool he sucks in service that I put a semi-fictional HKS or a pixie I remember when I was getting chopped up now and we gonna modify it to listen a little bit of a down five here the Flex joins actually on this side B band is on on the turbo end that's coming down here brushes cut the old down pop we live the rock shape and then it's basically going to come across to here and I'm going to put a new flange and send a bolt onto that cap it's looking good it's getting there it's gonna be sick once it's done I like this flick sorry that's really cool

(Start: 00:06:08)
there's a shot of the old girl up on my left so I'm not seeing it off to the two weeks [Music] just looking at this angle now at the radiator how I did the vimana I keep pretty damn good airflow boom hits the radiator hits the intercooler I think it's come out well if you just want to do some ducting over there you see that everything is put in like some sort of a ducting close it up so the air goes straight onto this radiator I also want to relocate this fuse box that are through there it wasn't the smartest of ideas I want to get it more onto that side or I don't know I'll figure it out hard a little bit bitter and get direct Iran to Bertha good come here well I'm stuck and we just need to fix that 3k issue and then yes the MEK you keep reminding me that there's a bolt inside

(Start: 00:07:09)
here those of you guys that are near here on the channel I dropped the freaking bolts into the sump from the top of the engine I thought I went into the engine was one of the scariest there's them all off I was busy putting a was he tightening the smoke whole thing whatever you call the fuller the filler neck and I had the wrong fastball from there it slipped right through it's all rot and all the way into the engine went all the way down the neck into the into the sump lucky because there's two parts and then if it fell to the right where I was standing it would have fallen into the writer into the right to housing out and I'm not taking cold would have fallen somewhere inside here and I would be [ __ ] stripped but luckily it's inside here I've thrown an endoscopic camera down and it's defiantly is a baffle that's somewhere to talk who it comes off to the engine and it stuck face down in the baffle so it's not moving anywhere right now I will pull it off just [ __ ] now if the cost sort of

(Start: 00:02:02)
that shows you how to readjust your TPS and all that stuff I rejected the fast idle cam by basically pulling on my throttle pushing off boss auto come down like that see that because in and then readjusting the little screw there the heartless degree and I've got my values back to you what they used to be when I thought the car was an issue boys we just got rust as rx-7 and rx-8 out and maan is about to go up on the look we're trying to figure things out like I said I've got the GPS VTA voltages back to what they were where they were apparently incorrect voltages I'm going to give it a try let's see what happens over my laptop here with the FC hacker studying route the other table underneath to get and my change maps if need be I don't think a little bit and

what's up girls and welcome back to a brand new video today's gonna be an exciting day I'm gonna be taking the rx-7 out like out of my driveway for a change let's just out of the garage I still have no exhaust and this is the reason why it's going out I'm gonna be taking a 3-2 rustic race engineering if you guys haven't seen the feature that it's the previous video links in the description and a little card somewhere here probably there they technically I take a look Russ is gonna be doing some awesome stuff with my FD and we're gonna be sorting out the exhaust I came in he had like 6:00 in the morning and I did some prep work down pops and now I remember that's a 76 mile HKS down pop that is a Nega top now and then mount it to my V bed there's the other HKS back box it's really made up I just don't have a mid part yet there's the thing for the AFR gorchakov sensor and then I quickly put everything back together this morning

(Start: 00:01:01)
because I stripped this whole shebang out because I was throwing out my TPS and I managed to get about TPS vaults just rot they are perfect right now they're within spec as per the stock somewhere this one values are now within range it wasn't in range and as you remember in the last two videos it's now sorted the idle air control valve or the idle speed controller that got its known place that wasn't there before so now I can do my idle ignition control switch that on and it'll do an idle instead of relying on values that I have on the ECU also places a little bit of a Miss because I've been putting up new shelves so I got a new shelf that's over there and I got another shot they go right to the end I'll just I ran out of space that stuff needs to be put back and it was looking cool and then yeah I took everything down because I want to rearrange I'm gonna move the car now

(Start: 00:02:03)
it's been on charge since about 6:00 something in the morning should be good and there should be a tow truck arriving in the next few minutes flatbed on me yes I got the battery terminal and then give it a thought I think I'm actually just going to put it on the road right now and then come back in and clean the garage up a little bit while I wait for the tow truck place okay

we're gonna carry on I've got to go back to work and Russell's gonna do a thing and no work on the car tomorrow so we'll have a whole video with just all written content about eight hours peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different and you must be kidding think you're gonna anyway you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the codes you gotta take as though you can't be you're proud of what you have no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do what I can to use all these opinions and all these positions they come in the millions they talk in your vision but no you can't listen that [ __ ] is on fixing cuz you want the powers why is your dream

[Music] or exhibits always being one of my favorite parts and I decided you know what I want to do I'm gonna make this thing brand new from start to finish [Music] started stripping the parts bringing together and decided to put my solicitors know what you want let's have a bit of fun far my love if you feel I gotta do right now don't say you're on the through the other side so yeah pretty much what we do here is we're an engineering shop I'm a tool maker we manufacture engineering components malls machinery squats I've always had a

(Start: 00:01:03)
passion for motorsport and decided to put my skill set to use geez man as a kid who's been into anything with four wheels and as I grew up but realized hey I'm actually quite good at putting these things together and taking them apart or exceeding always been one of my favorite cars and I decided you know I want to learn how to make this thing brand new from start to finish start a strip even box bring them together and decided yeah I can actually work on these engines really is a fairly bad stigmatism attached to that I write you they are short that's one thing it's always maintenance of you don't be amazed that it's gonna blow like you said bad stigma yeah so are you one of those guys that stand by your car or you want to build a quad and actually drive upon you know what's there to say but you know I really take pride in putting the whole project together making a boss and yeah that's that's what I enjoy some terms of what you can do for the

(Start: 00:02:04)
community that the car community especially in in durban I mean you can service the entire South Africa obviously and I we've got couriers everything's pretty efficient these days the whole performance parts seen with both components and aluminium like weight loss and high-performance things is kind of blowing up and here in South Africa it's a bit hard for us to get our hands on these kind of things with the exchange rate and shipping and a lot of the stuff is produced either in the States or the UK or anywhere else treating Australia's got a huge huge reputation when it comes to Reggie's that's really expensive to get stuff yet he addressed it we can manufacture just about any performance for that you need make a completely custom aluminum steel the works what we focus on you and we kind of really kicked off was starting to manufacture these performance bullet intakes so we started on on a 2 J bolt

(Start: 00:03:05)
we wanted four cylinders and we we saw huge increase in performance and really just able to tune motors that are lower boot subjecting the same amount of horsepower which is a lovely stressing components this obviously goes across the range we do anything from angle kits to refurbishing of rotary engines and are sort of divulge that say towards our oh geez it's not a huge market is not much support for a chair locally and as you know part of becoming more and more scarce to get so we got to look after it and here at rustic we refurbish them eat treat components do porting anything of the sort we've got a good partnership with with some other companies in the local area or to etc we partner up with one of the best chinos and sorry I forgot a candy garden so this little corner here is mostly rotary stuff as you guys can see him in real of rx-7 thumpers left right

(Start: 00:04:07)
and center we have something very interesting here that we're going to touch on in in a minute but Russ I mean these are these personal items or these or spheres what tell me a little bit about this stuff well man this is more like connection error collection awesome and I mean what are we got everywhere you got a we got a three right there all right so y'all a few people nari I'm gonna be doing three three right to both in the next EFD we had quite a bit of success on the 13b as push just over 500 horsepower wheels moderate one ball beasts normal pump gas 95 so that's the same one that some of my subscribers I've seen in previous video yeah yeah okay so that's that's like and are you ripping and replacing the motor no be not so we've actually got to eat disgusting of chewing on that bad boy oh man that's it what's coming up with your other Effie yes come on just have one so

(Start: 00:05:12)
second one is going to be a three rotor vault we are actually gonna try and get some serious figures out of this we we want to try and get a thousand watts pop and keep it as a street car we don't got that address and yeah let's just see see what this thing does so this is it's not built this is from a uns cosmos era Korea so this might say was imported from the back it was found in someone in your corner and like I said we're gonna bring it back - laughs this is gonna get dialed ported resurfaced he cheated everything you can think of it's gonna be running on a I'll take 11 mm respect - the wigs and obviously everything will be done in-house for yourself very well I bought a heat treatment so the heat treatment you outsource like I said none of the R&B whose been done by Kelly tuning will be done by candy and yeah I'm gonna see what I can

(Start: 00:06:14)
do mine and put this thing together and do all the engineering work the darling reporting all that jazz so what's the what's the ETA unless we're looking at next week why should was that easy no but yeah this actually takes a lot of time and effort you got to find good parts it's it's really easy some guys who just go to the dealership and pick up new housings and you know we're not really in that position but yeah we gonna make the best that we can out of this then I heard down the grapevine that you may be considering a for a to build in the near future also we've actually started some R&D on that we're going to be importing a shot from Australia and then when it comes to all the carrier bearings and the scene to ions etc that all be done in house will manufacture an intake for it and all that jazz and yeah definitely a for right after this we will you put it on of a fever now we're gonna put the series 613 deterrent an archetype

(Start: 00:07:16)
that'll be your rustic speaking people's current 13b that is in our running ft that almost probably gets replaced with the four outer and the one on the list rock now had the Trinity coolers let's take a quick walk around a philemon it's let's show the cause okay let's talk about these cars quick rest let's start on someone's gonna flame me on insta let's start of the worst or is it Oryx eight this is recent yeah so you actually just picked this up a few weeks ago restoring thankfully at the moment I'm gonna put a fifteen be tipper you bought it like this with my engine yeah it made sense for me to buy an on run down and just get a referee into the charger to put it back in oh hey it licks us out there is my first normally aspirated car luckily it's a daily but it's thought yeah so yeah those things cool yeah  chassis Moss and then this boy

(Start: 00:08:17)
this is one that you'll be storing the three rotor this part was done on a fairly clean we stripped off the engine bay in both spray not slightly getting back to putting all the parts back here on the front end of it and yeah putting in the tweeny be sorting out the subframe getting the suspension geometry to work with the bigger my turn so this is this is a late 1994 models are together love the hot wheels on this thing 18s not went five days re nasty signals sick and then you've obviously got a running one that everybody's seen could we take a quick look yes yeah man ed this cop about going on eight years now Tiffany wasn't like this when I got it what does that three scar you pull the motor out already

(Start: 00:09:25)
they're gonna be throwing in a 2j we'll leave it at that Russ thank you so much for having Garret to myself really appreciate it is anything that you want to tell the viewers before you well yeah sure if you've got any questions ten directories or you got some trouble and gonna give us abstract get hold of me Russell and rustic dossier or hit me up one honest again rustic race engineer [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey what's up everyone and welcome back to the vlog entering a hell of a long time sense actually picked up the camera properly mana is sudden the car and tell you guys what's up video this is me picking up the camera after a while anyway been daily driving this today what the hell I had such bad luck everything happens at once Nexus bonnet is open I'll get into that in a sec mr too busy standing down respraying the car I was daily driving the r32 GTR today because well the Lix has kind of had a few issues unfortunately this was more least embarrassing [ __ ] is that standing yeah check that out anyway I had a little bit of drama battery he seems to be flat on that well it was flat I put on charger for about six hours we're going to investigate it now but I need a move all the cars back to me their way let's start it up [Applause]

(Start: 00:01:13)
don't often you guys joining on a blog and all the cause of keen as some like washed because that I mean that's keen but it's not Kim because I'm standing or exuberance they're gonna issue made up let's Johnny earlier now just listen to the wall met up with Jonah Ilya Jonah gave me this this is an auto speed idle speed controller or auto control valve whichever way this goes on the back of the re-examine on you I am nobody here somewhere and I kind of deleted it just for the sake of deleting it I'll tell you why either because I printed out the spans are racing thing and then I made brackets exactly like those brackets recoiling blanking plates this is a bands I racing block off plate installation thing and they sold us for like I don't know fifty dollars or something but I was a cheaper so I took

(Start: 00:02:13)
off every single sensor drew it up and I had someone laser cut me new plates and it cost me like nothing super cheap alright I'll pull it off because of that that's not the cause of the three thousand rpm hesitation issue on the watch caucus or x7f t3s but it'll help with my idle and as it stands there's no ISC of turned off idle ignition control on the XE piracy and what that means is model ignition control uses that is C valve to idle car if you switch it off then it solely relies on whatever timing you have on the map and and all that valve does is just lets a little bit of air is [Music] with mr - I started with car up for the first time in three weeks in there I

(Start: 00:03:18)
started up at like 7:30 of something this morning in the cold like 14 degrees Celsius and this car started up so quickly listen to us like that doesn't start up this quick rx-7 doesn't start this quick not even LexA starts up this quick really impressive gosh me [Music] it's a little bit of drama this morning and I was forced to to daily the r32 GTR I've never dated that car never I've never driven it like on a normal basis like go out to the shops or go to a restaurant in their car [Music] and today we had a bit of drama where my one cat his back legs just collapsed and he couldn't walk and he stopped dragging

(Start: 00:04:19)
his legs [Music] pretty scary you're watching that and then we're trying to help him out but he wasn't crying or anything and then three four minutes later he was fun nothing wrong with it was if nothing happened he's gonna move me right [Music] anyway I was saying like three four minutes later he was perfectly fine he was running around doing whatever but this happened about two weeks ago for about a minute we just thought nothing of it we thought maybe like a dead leg cuz he was lying L so he returns out he's got something called flux ating kneecaps his kneecaps moving left and right or something I gather than his knees like pulling apart he has to kick it back into position terrible interact now for about the cat

(Start: 00:05:27)
earlier I picked up that is evil from John Hammond I'm at McDonald's and oh I was daling r32 GTR because I was in charge and I took Jonah for uh for a few minutes but I mean it was literally like two minutes we probably two kilometers and was the first time he's been in an Arthur T let alone a GTR and we only had like two and a half three years be thoroughly enjoyed it jeez you're actually doesn't all the way down there generally the MRC but I'm gonna be taking a time I was popping it with rx-7 maybe tomorrow with a black rx-7 I mean so now I want to have the black hippy here in custody a troubleshoot on that car it's so much easier having a working or examine that you can actually look okay

(Start: 00:06:28)
there are plug this one in the right place that'll pocket other one rough place you know that usual stuff that's good [Music] but if I ever showed you guys this I'll sit this up little while ago cuz I don't drive this coffin probably the least out of all of them I bet you kill switch here which I can do it with one hand

(Start: 00:07:29)
found my hammer I'll put a new battery and like three weeks ago and I haven't put the bracket thing on properly that's why the hen was there I still need a hammer something back on anyway watch the cost that I didn't feel like wearing you guys in the vlog excuse the [ __ ] in the background I've I've closed this this whole area down I've got this rbr sheeting in place I've made a door it's um it's actually outdoors from 1938 it was it was green kept from really old building that my my old man irons and it fits I'm busy scraping at and I'm gonna repaint that this whole areas gonna be closed up soon busy building a jungle gym that side of the house I never pay attention to my stuff anyway cause goodbye Klaus GTR will live another day

(Start: 00:08:30)
[Music] mr2 always runs okay that's done he's gonna stay there for like a few months rx-7 just by the way this is just a random video of public talking to guys picking up the camera cuz I'm getting back from check now I'm getting back into my editing back into my filming I'm working Jason in the UK and Jason Sweden and baked hick in the UK and we all trying to troubleshoot this car together what am i doing I'm putting the idle speed valve on just to fix the auto then I'm gonna be looking at my TPS the TPS voltages of ETA voltages lucky off our run out Tom today because it's damn likes the story

(Start: 00:09:31)
not today the GTR which by the way let me talk about the daily driving it sucked that's a GTR but holy crap I wear my tank Oilers on my car sit say like the hardest stiffness whatever you want to call it in the front and slightly looser in the back and jeez it's just but you something and it's just bumpy bumpy bumpy when you come from a luxury car and see that it's like a father jet versus a cruise ship anyway the pops and bangs are just a bit much as well I kind of like oh not the corn I'm like is gonna drive it hard the entire table she's quite a bit of fuel right you know having a problem with Lexus it's just battery probably needs to replace you know the issues I work five minutes puppies I work five minutes from

(Start: 00:10:37)
from the office from home whatever and I would see the battery doesn't get a charge the last two weeks my daughter's been a little bit ill and I've been busy just works that's backwards and forwards backwards and forwards to work homework batteries are getting charged nicely I think about you might be stuffed anyway got my voltmeter on and it's showing 12.16 it was about twelve point yeah twelve point one eight before started this vlog about twenty minutes ago quick check I'm gonna do I've already checked the Olson a does charge it and we'll do it again for the vlog this by the way is 2.5 v6 it's actually sounds decent but I didn't drive it hard pretty much never so what I want to do now is just check the voltage with nothing connected to the call so just plain battery

(Start: 00:11:44)
okay that's about the same okay so 12.16 it's exactly the same put that back on what am i doing I'm gonna stop the cost talks a little bit like it should be about 12.5 that was me I let go of the freaking brake pedal by mistake ignore that one system loading don't turn off power that's near no seen that before I ask Allah pull the battery okay on the seat how to check on just

(Start: 00:12:50)
EPS and FDR x7 inside Alexis I lost all my settings beeping now dammit general beep go one of the lost still beeping [ __ ] wonderful lost my friend stuff I know still connecting my friends [Music] yeah I listen to gangsta music be doused okay your ring still there cool let's go to look the charging

(Start: 00:14:06)
so sitting 13.9 for the tiffany charging automated different target for nom less I think I'm like 3.6 kilometers away from from the office like I said earlier I'm like 3.6 kilometers away from the office the problem of that is alternator doesn't get a give a good charge because I think with traffic with like a low traffic probably at eight minutes minutes drive that car anyway I don't get a charge the comet and then drive a long distance is often however I did go up to Hillcrest to go and film Russell Russell from rustic he's got that silver are excellent you seen in a couple of videos and he's got some he's got some some tirado some three dragons and for our

(Start: 00:15:07)
content that I've been filming and some super awesome stuff that's coming and icon which show you guys I've been editing the video but like I said I've been super busy at work anyway this is a completely random you got see four of the cars like rx-7 doesn't live here now but it will be next week here March is going black if T must come here forever and we'll do a couple of logs so a Russell's interview slash vlog thing that I've been doing is gonna be up next week and this video and a couple others to come we'll do some GTR content with the flames and the pops and all that stuff I just seen it finished filming so much stuff for any regards and girls thank you so much for listening to me talk [ __ ] the entire time I will see on the next video chest piece you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different and you must be kidding think you're gonna anyway just don't care that it's impossible it's not probable irresponsible too many

(Start: 00:16:09)
obstacles you gotta stop the codes you gotta take us though you can't be a prototype no more what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it I'm gonna [ __ ] - you throw these opinions and all these positions they come in the millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen that's it is on fixing cuz you want the powers why is your dream

Title: 7s day RX7 FD3S Startup and Scottburgh Classic Car Show
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjRM7pusnd0

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the vlog i just haven't been able to pick up the camera for plus minus two weeks now it's it's been crazy i've been well working real work and it's been super demanding so unfortunately youtube everything else comes second i haven't been able to post an instagram much i've finally finally had the time now to get youtube videos out really we'll start filming them and now i'm just a little bit busy so i'm trying to film every little gap that i have hence the reason why is he driving on the lexus so guys just a super quick update on what's been happening one i'm still having issues with the rx7 i battling to rev um see yesterday it was seventh day and i decided to celebrate i had a little bit of free time on a sunday and first of all i went to a car show it was called the scotburg classic kosher and i was hoping to see some rx7s there i did see one seven and one rx eight about four

(Start: 00:01:01)
years ago when i did go so i figured there might be a whole bunch of rx7s no they weren't but there were some other japanese cars take a look

(Start: 00:02:27)
then obviously doing a feature or kind of like more like an interview with some three-rotor content two fds and an rx-8 some super cool stuff happening there uh you'll see it in a week to come and yesterday update with my rx-7 man i was so annoyed because i've been working with jason and sweden jason and uk huge huge help uh baytech you although basic youtuber got subscribed to this channel um he's been helping me out just everyone's been giving me a lot of input and unfortunately i haven't had the time to go through and change and do every single thing because i've been so damn busy but things are calming down now i'm gonna get back into it so we've checked the map the map seems okay there's there's no boost cut and i mean i'd have to be achieving like point nine bar boost at three and a half thousand rpm it's not like your usual 3k hesitation this one if you take a look at this crappy instagram video that i

(Start: 00:03:30)
did [Music]

(Start: 00:05:10)
it hits about three and a half k and then it backfires kind of sounds like anti-lag strange so it might be map related i don't know um i'm missing my idle speed controller as i see valve and that that valve i gave away with my twin turbo stuff by mistake um i'm not probably saying you have all the expensive stuff away because i didn't need it and i thought i could help someone out um but that i put isn't the power by mistake other than that i kind of needed idle so that basically allows a little bit of air through automatically controlled by the power of c so the power c will ignore any idle timing that that you have inputted into the map and it will use this to learn your idle and then it will automatically adjust airflow accordingly to get your idle working i'm stumbling onwards here it's super early in the morning um so that's the one anyway i tried starting the car again it was indeed flooded and it took me about 35 minutes

(Start: 00:06:12)
jacked up the car went underneath pulled all the plugs my top plugs so it would be the trailing plugs the ones that use the i think it's the nines bru nine or something those plugs were soaking wet the bottom ones weren't so wet actually but i mean they were super dirty they were black but they weren't wet pull them out clean them with carb cleaner dry them out put them back in the car oh wait first i put pull the egr fuse started to crank the car a couple times and let it shoot out all the fuel that was in there put the plugs back in car fire right up instantly boom running idle was surprisingly better but still not great it kind of still drops off and the car dies out by itself um i need that valve and getting it back today's monday i'm getting back on wednesday and then i'm going to be trying again so i've got issues of that cost of we don't think it's throttle position sensor because the readings are okay

(Start: 00:07:14)
uh they're within range i don't know i don't know what it could be it could be the fuel pump now um remember this did happen when i picked up the rx-7 from port when it arrived in 2017. so this was happening in the past so it could be an underlying issue it did get resolved though when i put the apexy powerfd now it's back but it's not the same issue like i said it's more like an anti-lag weird i'm gonna get down to the bottom of it i just haven't had time now i've been super super busy and i don't have um what you would call it an exhaust i don't have an exhaust in the car right now which means i can't put on a air fuel ratio wideband which i do have with the aem wideband i just didn't have a bung to put it on so i need to go make up this exhaust urgently so i can see what the hell this car is doing with regards to fuel that is it for the update um lots of stuff coming i've been doing ignition timing changes to the r32 gtr

(Start: 00:08:14)
and something else that i did i was playing around with fuel cuts so now i can make these crazy pops and bangs i have recorded the video mostly i need to do one more run in the evening with the gopro at the back so you guys can see flames and then i will edit and i'll push that out i've had it for like three weeks but i'm just not happy with the footage because i want to get the flames on um that's pretty much it that's what's been going on i've just been crazy as busy and it's it's every end of june july every year i'm gonna be like this for like two three weeks so that is it for the video guys thank you so much for watching i will see you all the next one peace

Title: RX7 FD3S 3k hesitation troubleshooting - Apexi PowerFC
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5eb2iuHhDk

(Start: 00:00:00)
it's up gasps welcome back to the vlog I actually landed a picking up the camera yesterday vlogging how much it's tough but I figured it's boring so to show you what's going on now basically I'm having an issue where a quandary of past 3000 rpm on rx-7 fd3s big signal terrible mouthful there's a whole lot of hesitation things that you can find on forums on Google everywhere basically everybody complains about these multiple different fixes from changing spark plugs to coils to coil packs to grounding and so you're just taking a little stuff in my pocket lots of different fixes and lots of different things you can do to try and alleviate the problem I had the car working prior to this on the pixie power FC so that's not an ECU issue it used to be an ECE issue I had this issue with a car ah funny enough with the twin-turbo setup recall it's 100% factory stock did all the fixes spark plugs leads fuel filter

(Start: 00:01:02)
blah blah you guys remember there was like eight nan videos that I did in a row of just trying to get the damn car running because I had it I needed to pass inspection and I'll ended up buying an ECU the a pixie piracy with the hand controller bombed and instantly I could react to 3k which was awesome and I was waking up fine up until the day I started doing the single tip install and now that I was starting a tack on get boss 3k so whatever done I got on the phone with Russell from rustic we did a video chat and I was just double-checking stuff under here so underneath the you I am on the side of the L I am and you can see some of the footage from yesterday just got off a long video chat with Russell and he's been guarding me through a couple of things one are completely [ __ ] up my fuel pressure regulator vacuum hose I don't know what I did I think just not working on the car I kind of forgot where plug stuff and we are left off so my fuel pressure regulator down here had

(Start: 00:02:04)
a vacuum and I saw loose vakyam just lying around I didn't plug it into the manifold because I found a loose tea piece down here somewhere this TPS not this one over my hand those TPS is for the cruise controller see if I go down there so I figured okay well that vacuum belongs there and I plugged in that Kira doesn't work because the fuel pressure guitar wasn't getting any any reckon then I found this or two other things yeah so this one's been blocked off and then there's another one yeah yeah I'll see that this one yeah that one see it's got a block on it just follow that blocked over there spoke to Russell those can be blocked off that's old twin - oh crap I wasn't too sure about some vacuum leads that are blocked

(Start: 00:03:05)
off turns out I was fun they were blocked off because they're actually even apples coming off the L I am that I can really make out so there's one down here somewhere and that's that is blocked off so it's not an issue this is a slightly different UI m and Li into some of the other models there's other models with the li m that have nipples on the side three nipples on the back you see here it's supposed to be like three vacuum levels under them that doesn't matter it's all good one major thing I [ __ ] up and this is the issue with working on a car one month or they're not working on it again because you tend to forget see we're not about to do the first startup I saw there was a loose hanging vacuum line here okay and then I saw all right well there's a watching mccord down here at ep's so let me just plug the run but they obviously

(Start: 00:04:06)
meant to be together and I did that and then it turns out all I did was plug the fuel pressure regulator into the base control solenoid that means fuel pressure irregular water isn't getting any manner pressure also that part popped off the map the map sensor so that wasn't working either so I had some vacuum leaks and if PR wasn't getting any any readings hmm there was also something else here that I found getting down I think it's one of them will inject two vacuums I've just plumbed it on other than that I think I'm good I think I've done everything we're gonna start it up right now I'm on my and I didn't want to bother anybody now push the car out come on start it up so this guy here we go couldn't be bothered with camera angles today just get rough dude oh yeah I also added a bunch more grounds whatever they

(Start: 00:05:08)
just dropped our two in the front see if that makes any difference okay let's do this [Applause]

(Start: 00:06:09)
[Music] don't sound a little bit better still knob or exhaust let's put that red thing back on I'm worried about the brake lines and stuff there's a lot less smoke out right that's not good PJ one okay still not working and this time my VTA one was showing four point eight which far as notes like too much fuel

(Start: 00:07:11)

(Start: 00:01:02)
but that's good enough for the startup cause down for the first time in a long walk I just realized I haven't charged that battery battery charges inside this thing the battery is low so garish should be in the next 10 minutes so I'll give this thing like 15 minutes charge it should be fun actually looks pretty cool when it's down on the ground Gareth's not here yet I'm gonna push the call myself [Applause] [Laughter] just fill up the system much a radiator further came out with overflow we good

(Start: 00:01:01)
delete I don't know it just yet I think probably the delete the neatest thing you can do in here anyway it's currently held on it's up tot it's not moving anyway it's not rubbing against anything which is awesome and in terms of pop work I've got that line running all the way down under there and there's a join now I about the type I'm just waiting for the silicon to harden put these inners they're not explained in C because I'll just use them up they kind of look like like that obviously is the tepees so it'll kind of look like that but it was made out of metal and that's the thing between them put some silicon and some plumbers type I should all applaud nasty and then there's obviously another one that runs right underneath the radiator which is this one here and that runs some way onto the AST I'm done I'm gonna leave that st from now not too sure about this

(Start: 00:02:02)
pop same story here I got silicones drying out pull of that that blue insulation type when I'm done not see happier this piece actually probably I treasure but I don't have enough money right now you're wondering hope that noises my dogs are murdering each other outside Gareth just give me a call he's on the way that means we can pull this guy back and then flip the shroud and I can't quite a lot done which means I can stop closing up here I was a little bit worried that Gareth wasn't going to come through but he is he's gonna be my saving grace I have some fake spoiler to have this in the United States but anyway fizzy drink will be my first fizzy drink in a very long time I used to drink like one and a half litres of fizzy juice every day it was so bad I've actually cut it out completely I'm still

(Start: 00:03:02)
eating a lot of [ __ ] food but I've lost 8.9 kilos a proton kg is just from not drinking fizzy drinks which is insane anyway there's a lot of weight loss channel and I'm Laurin just hit us Gareth Oliveira gonna transfer that shroud we're gonna do and then we get cracking and put in tequila pops back on I need a cut this one a little bit shorter that's not that one this guy yeah see this one that's on the intercooler here remember it's of e-mount and it's gonna go from there to there using that piece I need to cut this angle a little bit more because the bonnet wasn't closing so nice so that anyway garrison though I wanna wait I mean to celebrate with some fizzy sugars to [ __ ] and take from there or it goes fast forward like how long's it been but to a bit hours just before 8:00

(Start: 00:04:08)
anyway but two and a half hours and we finished the or week seven Cameron looks good okay so we pretty much finished cars there's a couple clamps that I still need to throw on I need a obviously get this clamp work here but bitter it's rubbing against yeah pull us aside which means this needs to go across a little bit but for the most part I mean this thing is damn level we through for the most part this is actually working out quite well we through a level on to here everything is hundred percent now the radio is leveled radiator is super steady this is not moving anywhere ast is not moving either I think either to show you guys in the vlog that but this is that I just need to finish some clamps that needs a cab that needs a clamp has clam needs to be taught and and they need to go in the right direction I'm not happy with us but we just do it so I could take Cricut Instagram Twitter and gods I'm done I just need to do that down pop it's it's crazy I mean Gareth nah we're just staring at it now and and we finally at

Title: How to BUY an RX7 FD3S for $300 Dollars!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTkU9HLxd_Q

(Start: 00:00:00)
so you want to buy an rx-7 for 300 well you're going to want to watch this video then all right i'm not kidding when i say this i found an rx-7 fd 3s that sold for 300 us dollars you heard me around 300 us dollars absolutely crazy anyone could have bought it i'm pretty sure this car is going to go to the united states it's a 1993 model it sold for 324 us dollars let me show you what that car is all about and then i'm going to show you how you can do this yourself now generally i look at the auctions at least five to six times a week or five to six days a week i was a bit tied up last week pretty busy i didn't look at the auctions at all and i missed this one and you know it's just one of those things murphy's law wasn't meant to be so without further ado this is the 324 rx-7 fd 3s now i did have someone translate this page for me today and i found out some interesting stuff in here

(Start: 00:01:02)
first of all here it is silver in color i mean it's not crashed generally for that price you'll find a car missing missing everything um [Music] pretty good conditions got that little duck tail spoiler not the one that i've got i've got the whale tail one red badge on the back stock twin exhausts it's got this little spats in the rear as well here's the issue it's an automatic okay not a bad thing when you when it comes to modifying because you can pull it out you can put a manual gearbox in you've got to change the ecu as well and then if you really want you can change the cluster pack not to have a little up thing that has auto on it anyway it can be done and uh it's not that expensive to change or i had someone translate this and there was some interesting stuff in here the first one being 2001 1223 so in 2001 december it had a mileage of 121 000 kilometers on it 2002 the mileage dropped to 71 000

(Start: 00:02:04)
kilometers somewhere here i don't remember which piece i think it might be that one it says that the mileage was manipulated now the current mileage the date of selling june 14 2019 it had 89 thousand so eighteen thousand kilometers was put on to since 2002 but it's mileage this car actually had about a hundred and fifty thousand plus minus the next item is engine does not start it's probably a issue at the rotary i'm not an issue of the right tree it is an issue of the right tree the rotors are probably stuffed or i don't know it could be seals could be anything but it was common it's all speculation at this point we don't know what happened with this car why it set why it sold why anything anyway it sold for 300 and someone was lucky enough to pick up this car it's such a bargain now i mean anyone with enough patience can find a deal like this you can use japan partner i've bought the rx-7s and the gtr from japan partner

(Start: 00:03:07)
pacific auto derek he runs youtube channel he's also got an auction site garage defend spencer i don't know if they've got a full-on auction site yet but give them a shot japan partner is who i've been using and i don't really like using a new auction system i'm still using the old one so we're gonna stick to the old one for now so just log on to old.japan click here old auction search system search and then one you can click market price and you can go back one week only of the prices what do you want to search for in this case we're going to go mazda and we're going to go for if any rx7 and rx7 now why when it says if there's just some places some auction houses so you'll find like this arai bay side there's an auction house gifu auction house yokohama is an auction house they will label the cars differently so they might just put it on the rx-7 or they know that it's if any they'll put it therefore except

(Start: 00:04:08)
so for example there's a bunch of kazia that actually sold and let's make some space here let's take a look at this guy that one and that one you can see here eight and a half thousand us dollars has 94 000 kilometers it's an rb with a c interior and a sea exterior and you can pick up all the stuff that's a little legend over here that you can read through um yeah i mean this this is a great car really nice looking car rd wheel it's got a holder here for an apexi power fc i don't see it in the vehicle though anyway we're not gonna go through all these cars right now just a quick one just to show you guys how to use the auction system and take a look at this one 13 000 that's a great 4c very good quality very good car like i said we're not going through that right now what i'm going to show you what to do and if you have enough patience like i said now i'm shooting myself in the foot because i also want i wouldn't have 300 or x7 but in the interest of helping the

(Start: 00:05:09)
community grow this is what you do so select all the dates don't click market price because it'll just show you what the cost sold for now remember not all cars will show as sold or the price as sold not a lot of people disclose that or maybe the call wasn't sold at all or there was a negotiation afterwards uh they'd say it didn't meet the reserve there might have been a negotiation with the the seller and then it's sold and doesn't list the price so you can see here for example not sold that was the last price that it got up to maybe it didn't hit the reserve etc this one for example this type x went up to 1 200 us dollars and nobody else better not so the reserve could have been one five you never know and um anyway that's how it generally works and you get cars like the silver 300 one with this page when it has this it means that there's no inspection generally there's an inspection like i mentioned will be r a or

(Start: 00:06:10)
grade four grade three et cetera grade five is brand new very very good i don't think i've ever seen a used card grade five other than like a 22 b that was pristine and uh hakusa yeah and then you got your gratings a b c d e e is pretty rotten that means this car is not inspection so you'll obviously find cars with no inspection to be very cheap or a lot cheaper right that being said you're gonna go down to maker you're gonna go down to mazda click on model and click on ethernet you're gonna click on rx7 click search now everything i said earlier goes out the window because i forgot about this they're still showing old cars or the cars that were sold on the old system but now i think they're forcing you to use the new system to actually bid on cars anyway just sign into this and then on the right side you're gonna click on use car options

(Start: 00:07:13)
and all the days are selected click on make click on mazda click on model rx7 and if any and click search now these are upcoming auctions so you can see today i'm filming this on the 20th of the 6th and this car is up for auction on the 21st at 11 in the morning in japan now these sort of cars here i'll know straight off the bat that this one has been inspected so you can see it's a it's an r c c anterior c exterior extensive work extends body kit icon in japanese generally you get this translated but we're not here to talk about these cars we had to talk about the cheap ones so this one i can see it's an outside yard there's probably no inspection see no inspection luckily this car either the owner didn't want to pay for inspection which is stupid or the engines popped

(Start: 00:08:14)
and he just figured let me just get rid of it cheap now these ones when you see the outside pictures these are the ones that you're going to look out for these are the ones that go super cheap this one was obviously a late model 2001 spec in what it's got the nice steering wheel is manual transmission and um to be honest it probably doesn't have a blind engine now country japanese i don't know what this tells you probably this is engine not starting 952 us dollar stock price this car will probably sell for about 3 000 us dollars but we don't know what's wrong with it more than likely engine's gone take the price of an engine rebuild i mean probably still worth it all right so those are the ones those outdoor ones to look out for all of these ones on the inside they're all inspected all right and before i forget these that say buy now these are what japan partner has in stock right now in their yard now it's a bit strange because when my

(Start: 00:09:16)
cars landed with japan partners so obviously like for example one of my cars actually did come from here from uss nagoya when it leaves uss nagoya and goes to japan partner which is also in nagoya they list it as a stock item and buy it now price which is odd and it's not the same price that i paid for the car it was much higher anyway my car popped up on here and i got a bit worried and i said to the guys hey listen why is my car up for sale after i just paid a whole bunch of money for it and i said no no we do that we load it as a stock item we then invoice you blah blah so that's that's that so this is these cars are probably sold what they have in stock so now that i give that useful piece of information those cars have issues and in south africa there is a restriction in terms of getting the car registered and on the road licensed now i'm not going to do a full licensing video and what it entails so the basics are 25 duties there's 15 vat there's shipping

(Start: 00:10:16)
charges now the shipping is an interesting one shipping is a thousand one hundred dollars for a railroad which is roll on roll off the vehicle has to be powered by its engine and driven onto the ship parked driven off when it comes down to africa so they've got a little mechanic crew on the ship that will do basic stuff jump starts and all that just to make sure the car's running so if it's stuffed like that 300 one where we know the engine is completely finished it's not going to start you can't do a railroad so that's the caveat here and that means that you have to put that car in a container now container is roughly about 5 000 us dollars we look at about 60 000 rand uh this is off the top of my head i actually don't remember the price for 20 foot as far as i remember and this was some time back when i was looking probably more expensive or cheaper i don't know so it has to go on that so that's a thing um condu roll on roll off which

(Start: 00:11:17)
works out it's about fourteen thousand round hundred thousand one hundred us dollars and i'm pretty sure that rule would apply to anybody overseas railroad shipping is global it's international thing you wouldn't be able to do it and it would be pretty cool if you could because then the car would land here for nothing i mean i calculated licensing fees your interpol clearance your nrcs are tech waybridge corr all of that stuff plus shipping plus that 300 car would have landed here for something ridiculous like a thousand five hundred us dollars uh plus minus so there was like 21 or 23 000 round which is nothing in saying all of that if you do get the car here and you have to bring it in a container you have a limited amount of time because there's some sort of inspections nrcs will come check the car and all that stuff and you're going to license it it's got to pass cr it's got to get to the weight bridge drive onto the way bridge station so you need a running car and you have to do

(Start: 00:12:18)
all that stuff within one year of the car landing in the country so you have one year to do all that stuff so which means you need to fix the engine and all of that and that takes time to do all that documentation so realistically i'd say you probably have about seven months before you need to have a running car which is not bad the problem is can't use row row shipping and container shipping is hella expensive so that's when a company like grinrod or if you're watching us from overseas there must be another company where you can do shared containers look into getting a shared container throw the car in there it's still a lot more expensive than a railroad shipping but you have no choice for the railroad because the car's not running throw the corner container and get the car here fix it pass inspections do all that stuff registered bank you've got an rx7 for like let's say four thousand dollars maybe less a lot less maybe three thousand dollars with an engine because they're pretty cheap you can

(Start: 00:13:18)
pick up an engine for let's take a look i think it was like 11 or 12 000 rent which is 900 i don't know if i'm looking at the best place but oh look at that added 23 minutes ago getting sidetracked here see here's a gearbox for sale talking about the automatic rotary 5 and 6 speed gearbox for sale six speed must be a rx8 six and a half thousand round which is for all you guys overseas give you something comparative yeah 440 dollars another one here seven thousand round plus minus five hundred dollars there's an rx8 motor now for eighteen thousand i did see one the other day rx eight damn it's currently none for sale

(Start: 00:14:19)
i'm pretty sure someone for like 11 12 000 right okay i can't find any for sale right now found nine and a half thousand rounds about 700 650 us dollars for an rx 8 13 b i know it's not the same thing but let's just double that for the sake of the argument so not a thousand dollars and you have a running car that is ridiculous as chump change just have a running rx-7 anyway that's a story or you could use it as a part car the problem is getting it to wherever you are anyway that's it for the video if you guys want to see other videos similar to this like really cheap skylines or really cheap jdm cars in general i can put that together i actually have a repository of cars that i've been saving over the last two years that are either like really crazy out there for example i found an electric motor powered rx-7 fd3s yeah there was an electric motor put it instead of the rotary motor that i mean i found that at the auctions anyway it's super cheap as well um all sorts of stuff let me know if you

(Start: 00:15:20)
want to see that sort of content in the future i can show you all that stuff if you want to know more about import rules let me know all right thank you so much for watching i'll see you all in the next video peace you

Title: Hybrid Electric Fans for the RX7 FD3S
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQFWI7w_ISg

(Start: 00:00:00)
sup girls and welcome to the vlog damn cold out yeah it's about 10 degrees at the moment early in the morning and figured I'll show you guys what I've been doing with the rx-7 and what's happening all these fans that have been sitting up it's been about two weeks plus mono since Gareth and John are over here at the house helping me work on the big single turbo it's one of these things where it's super slow progress and it's my own fault one is adulting too I'm always busy doing something else another person's car feature or something that's not related to mine cause like throwing a JD a meet that sort of stuff in here a lack of Tom means lack of work so if you guys remember right in the beginning when I took the entire radiator system out there was an issue with the fence one of them built completely melted and killed himself just when you put all this crap back together oh man I need more tongue

(Start: 00:01:07)
because here's three with a fend this stock shroud this is one of the fans of stock panel now these fans actually really good I know a lot of people that aren't in the know with re-examines they say take the fan out put electric fan and and just get on with it well if you guys scour all the forums all the or except in club forums and actually pretty much anything rotary low relates they say use the standard shroud with the standard fans are actually really good they're highly efficient and there's no need to change the middle there's very few electric fans initially spending major money just to get a couple percent more efficiency a couple percent difference it's not worth it so keep the stock set up and also something to do with the spacing of the stock shroud that sits between the radiator and the fan distance and all that stuff burning it's really good now my issue is I'm a cheap-ass then on

(Start: 00:02:09)
to spend money on buying a new shroud a secondhand shroud you're looking at about 200 plus dollars from what I've been finding I think I did find out for about a hundred and twenty past - dollars but then I gotta add I mean a hundred dollars shipping to South Africa which yeah anyway so I made do with what I had my old man helped me out because the previous one the blades actually melted and it broke off completely so my old man made me thus so he made an adapter plate with see that for the old fan and then I picked up this random fan blade thing obviously is fan blades themselves on as good as the stock one but anyway I'll through the Sun and stupidity excuse the miss here that tom kean up the stock fan right oh it's all stopped if you don't even know it is right now

(Start: 00:03:11)
oops look at that so as soon as I open that it's opened inside mom my dad used to be an armature wander about 40 years ago so he has some knowledge with fans and motors and all that stuff and apparently little windings and solder all melted and burnt I have no idea where I put the damn thing I think I may have tossed it I wouldn't have tossed I don't know now I'm talking to myself again so anyway this is what I have left with a fan cuz I don't know what I bit of it somewhere in the [ __ ] I call the garage there's ice melted this will break and yeah I have an issue so we're doing is I'm wanting to retain the stock setup this works well and it was working in the car however the call was getting a bit hot it was climbing up to like 95 degrees plus and then when I shut down or get like 105 and I've started up again and blah blah too hot so what I've done is

(Start: 00:04:11)
again with the help of all day bought an electric fan and he made some funky brackets so they were actually mountain here it's just it's an adapter plate thingy that he made his little triangle pieces pretty cool bolts of the peg back on and it has a smaller fence it would come in look something like this but I don't need that anymore it's now sitting in here really powerful here's the plan here's what I'm gonna do oh wait do you guys want to see this thing in action before carrier it is super powerful I've got it facing the same direction as the other one there's no issues and throw it on to the battery crazy strong love it this is the Spock

(Start: 00:05:15)
bonus over here the suspense what exactly the sampling actually extended these I could actually plug them in because the radiators ever seen me a physician now I'm sure it's V mount setup thin of those anyway stock harness and what it is is ground and then she need to get the diagram doesn't have a diagram in front of me so I ground this black I think the yellow is something called a thermo switch the green is the 12-volt constant and the blue is 12-volt ignition I may be wrong there's diagrams all over the internet but that's what the four do maybe in the wrong order now what I'm going to do is I'm going to plug it in in the front yet before I carry on these four things here these are four relays that control the fans and all stuff that I mentioned was controlled by that now when I'm setting it up what I'm going to do is here's the fan plugs to fan plugs I'm gonna run the stock fan into the original harness and assembly controlled by the ECU s it's

(Start: 00:06:18)
three speed fan setup so basically it's got low medium and high it's controlled by the ECU and marques has got an a pixie power of C stanlon ECU it's also controlled by that offset it's coming a lot sooner factory I think it comes in like at a hundred or 102 degrees and that came and so hot for emissions back in the day and there was the there way to get past the emissions laws overseas and what with in Japan all I wanted to run that hotter obviously so I've turned it down the ones in a kick in earlier and the other one I'm going to run on a manual switch and I'm gonna have it come on we're not feel the need we're not seeing our temperature rises more water temp from or oil temp to XML I'm gonna have to switch manually I couldn't be asked to sit upright and relays and and extra fuses and all that stuff just to get the damn van waiting so what I'm going to be doing is I'm still gonna use the stock harness for that electric fan but I'm running ground and I'm going to be running 12-volt ignition or maybe 12 volt constant I'm not 100% sure yet and

(Start: 00:07:20)
I'm gonna run a switch inside the car some way I haven't decided yet to control this bad boy now essentially that said that's my hybrid sit up I'll always have this fan connected it's a pity I didn't have the shroud I mean I even got in touch with Russell from rustic you saw him in my JD and meat video doing some crazy shenanigans he's using the stock ones on his cause he's got two FDS at the moment and he's using both shrouds I was I think bowing off him but that's not happening everybody uses the stock crowds so anyway that's model hybrid scenario setup thing was he doing at the cause and well hopefully it'll work on another night today when I have a little bit more time I'm gonna clearcoat this we're just doing a test of what this gold tape and I've actually run out so I need to get some more but anyway clear coat the rest of it it's gonna look damn

(Start: 00:08:23)
good once it's done the keyer coat finish that and then I've decided that this strut bar which is gonna be running between that purple thing in that purple thing there's gonna go gold it's a pimple and gold bear what else to have to do let's just put the fans do the wiring for it put everything back together and then I'm done and I'm hanging in my down pop keep selling this but waste something it gets in the way you know that fancy it up I was actually rather bleak about it it was the day after Jonna and Gareth was here I mean I see it's the guys that's pretty much all I need to do it's it's put the fan shroud in and get the down pop made so I gotta looks awesome my dad made the parts for the fan shroud obviously to get that other wot fan blade thing working and I'll super stoked I'll put it all together and then in HoN SOT always I should have

(Start: 00:09:25)
tested the motor so hey I'll put it on and I realize hang on the ones not tuning it actually a turn looks lucky and then didn't want to turn again and then when we stripped it it was just completely fried like stuffed like yeah the windings inside we're coming out and not good anyway and hot salt like a sailor should taste the damn thing but obviously that didn't happen so yeah that was about a day off to Gareth and John over here working on the car and I was super excited just wanted to throw that shroud and then get the car started put everything back together peace everything back together rather and then that week I was planning on getting the dump up now obviously laughs got in the way again and I got a call from Larnaca which was a pink super that I did the feature on and had the opportunity of filming that and then the edit took two days lots of excuses and then I besides red JD and

(Start: 00:10:25)
meet in between and yeah busy so that's why this cars been taking so long mostly because the garage doors closed I see have not forget about it anyway that's pretty much it for the video that's me rambling I am gonna go now and play the GTR because it's made some time so check out the next video it's gonna be really cool see you guys then just peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different and you must be kin think you're gonna anyway just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the bones you gotta take as though you can't be your prototype no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it too guess all these opinions and all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen their cities on fish because you want the power is why use your training

(Start: 00:00:00)
everyone and welcome back today is gonna be the Q&A video it's been now a little while and I'll actually tell you exactly when it was so eight weeks ago on my Instagram I put our story saying and asked me anything an answer in an upcoming video on YouTube I've been so busy and there's been other content that's well but getting in the way of making this video and figured it's time now to the Q&A there's also a couple questions on YouTube and comment section that you guys have been asking me and I've left unanswered so let's get Instagram out the way it goes on following me go check me out at LPL JDM I'm just over 2,000 followers now fishes reaping fantastic catching up to YouTube now so first question comes from 1224 when are you porting the FD I'm gonna run a Dez's and if it blows i

(Start: 00:01:01)
will 1jz expression comes from sub-zero motorsport any Subarus being looked at to add to the collection yes so first of all before I go into this I used to be an evidence uber and collector I was really connected cuz I sold him but I had non Subarus at one stage not altogether I think the maximum I had altogether was three and yes to answer your question I would love to get another one but it needs to be special and not twenty to be special because that's ridiculous money and I'd rather spend the same amount of money in buying three four other JDM cars but something like a two-door gc8 of some style it is very difficult for us to import one but there are a few floating around and I'd love to snap one up now the question from Sub Zero - the

(Start: 00:02:02)
courts would you trade your current gt-r for the new 2019 spec no next question comes in from Gareth Bhagat we know he's shooting the next feature well this coming week reading a Superboy's Britain YouTube 2006 are you going to customize and put a for wrote up on your rx-7 it would look sick dude for it one lots of money too there's already two it was cool your art it was cool the nice 400 money and a lot of people have asked me actually there is a question yeah and that will tie in with this one mr. Denton for three one why you got so many jdms okay what kind of ties in with the previous ones I would not put in a Florida because I'm on a mission at the moment that mission

(Start: 00:03:03)
is to try and pick up as many JDM cars as possible before the process shoot up and ready so I'm try my hardest mr2 FDS of the v2 GTR as previously mentioned but you want to get an NS six I doing again a Mitsubishi GTI so I'm keeping Mars and here's to the ground and there was a 286 that I was trying to buy last weeks and his chassis has already JDM because we had them here locally but still try to figure it out the winch and the chief because sold like instantly yeah anyway so I'm trying but there's also lot of stuff that's happening in the background there's a lot of well I don't think that I have to do and renovations and that's costly very costly we bought this house it was a bit of a shambles we redid the interior beautifully new towels and your ceilings new everything and just lifts outside and now it's been

(Start: 00:04:08)
the time to redo the outside and it's expensive so no flirting to me but I will be collecting a lot more JDM cars in the near future next question I'm in Musashi longtime subscriber if you could have only one JDM car and what would it be for me it's the LFA and if a knight I like all J M stuff I go this is a tough question as much as I love my 32 I would probably try get into the unknown and the unknown would be a Supra - Jay Z Mach 4 2000 like there would be the CID is our spec with a CID or I think it's as it is or that's what I think lost fish lines to gain from Aden for a big what would be a dream occupation car was honesty dream occupation a lot of people would say I would love to be a mechanic for Ferrari

(Start: 00:05:10)

Title: 5 Things I hate about my JDM RX7 FD3S
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu5vn-mxqMM

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to a brand new video this is five things I hate about my rx-7 ft3 years before we can carry on video I got to move this hunk of junk it is a mini Leyland I think 1975 I don't know my dad just picked this thing up he's a lot of work so he's first time driving mini ever I'm gonna put it out somewhere there early Krampus is weird [Music] now here she is this is the 1997 Turing X or X 7 ft 3s but doesn't get a lot of screen time on my channel really because it lives here at my parents place I

(Start: 00:01:00)
don't have enough space in my house yet to keep it there but this is that this is my first-ever rx-7 I imported it's called a mistake 20 years 70 or 2016 in 2016 long story short my daughter was two months old past modest and she was having morning feeds like early morning feeds to 3:00 in the morning and while I was holding her feeding her a little bit despondent that I didn't win an rx-7 at the auction so I landed up clicking on every single Oryx even that was on the birds for about two weeks and I put it on every single one of them and well I'll ended up winning this thing now what you need to remember this is 5 things that I hate now everything I'm gonna mention in this video is what a person you hate about this car not like the r32 GTR videos that I did where I put everybody hate those issues so getting right into us he has issue number one that I really hate this was super bad when the car arrived that's a lot better now basically that's got knocked and badly when it arrived in the port bashed in here this was all bashed

(Start: 00:02:01)
and the lot was whiskey like hanging off and well it's been repaired mostly those panel still needs to pop out a little bit and I mean this is all home job I've been doing this for my father pulling it out and touching it up a little bit but it needs a little bit more work just to straighten these two up but this was terrible that one thing I really hated about the car number two something that pissed me off was this rail side wing that came on the car and it came with rx-7 from Japan I mean it was cool back in 2000 2001 but not these days so now it's got one of these whale tail wings which I really like however there's holes in the boot lid and this is irritating because water seeps through I haven't pulled them up yet it needs to go to a panel beater you need to close it up and you respray everything so that's number two that's what I really hate about it now number three you may not see it with a current lighting at the moment it is getting a little bit dark but the rear of the car is a different shade to the rest of the car to the rest of the body and this door is a completely different color to

(Start: 00:03:01)
the to the rest of the car now bear in mind that's called landed for just under sorry not landed this cause board at the auctions for just under two thousand US dollars so pretty much constant nothing that doors are different color you might not see it in this video but I might overlay something you can see the difference it's not nice it's obviously crashed maybe the doors replaced I don't know just some bonus content here the steering wheel is a piece of [ __ ] I have this in the silver rx even I have it on this one it's massive I mean look at the size of a compared to my hand compared to normal my my steering wheel this thing is huge it's in the way it's right up against your knees when you're sitting down I mean I'm one point seven six meters seats all the way back and the stereos right up against me this sucks the newer rx Evans at better steering wheels are out the fourth issue that I have with the car is the paintwork in general there's a lot of clear coat damage mostly on the side of the car on the roof especially it was actually rusting here so we standard it down we

(Start: 00:04:02)
did some hammer out on the top you see there that still needs a good stand it needs a touch-up actually needs to be a resprayed completely but that was just done so that the car doesn't rust up and go for [ __ ] so paint is an issue all over the place these little tiny touch-ups and blemishes and rear bumper there's spider webs things are not looking great so I mean from far this car looks pretty clean but because of black car also show it's quite a lot a lot of stuff is mana and you guys probably think I'm whinging I mean it just needs a respray to be honest but it's one of the things that I hate about it this lot cavity has cracked that's actually a quick fix run some cube on on it sand it down should be hundred lots and lots and lots of stone chips all over the car let's get into the last and final drop on this car and you guessed it and that's really why this car so damn cheap it's an automatic well having

(Start: 00:05:06)
an FD that's an automatic isn't that fun I mean let me put you in perspective yeah it's still got the primary turbo and the secondary server so the twin-turbo setup so the secondary turbo kicks in roughly three and a half thousand rpm and it goes all the way up to about seven thousand before losing its efficiency or going out of its efficiency range this kicks on at three in the hospital but it changes gears at like five four which sucks so we just get into boost you just enjoy up a stand a chance it gets not cool at all but it is what it is it is cheap it was cheap and values is climbing on these even this one the values just risen so much something burned us that I don't like about the car is that there's all these drill holes all over the dash actually that side of the - it's clean little over here there was some there were two gauges or three gauges here that well--we're crap and they came out then just regards to the engine bay it's like what I need it's still got the stock twin-turbo setup it's name of an open I

(Start: 00:06:06)
have history for with us coops about 120,000 kilometres it's got about 140,000 kilometers on at the moment never been open as far as we know still that stock to interior set up it's got the stock airbox this airbox it set up actually came off my silver FD this car had that HKS super-powerful air intakes and I converted back to standard but the stand exhaust on everything's back to standard anything else modified is this little intake pop broke I don't want to buy a new one just for the sake of lips I put these two clamps on so this happened turn into more of a walk around video well it is what it is that's my black rx-7 fd3s and this was five things I hate about my rx-7 so thanks everyone for watching really appreciate if you don't mind slept that lock button that subscribe button if you're not subscribed already and let me know what you want to see in the future let me know in the comment section what type of videos anything really and I'll try make it thank you so much see all the next one peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really

(Start: 00:07:06)
think you're different and you must be kidding think you're gonna hate it we just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable irresponsible too many obstacles you got to stop the codes you got to take us though you can't be you're proud of what you have no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do what I can to use all these opinions and all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but no you can't listen that [ __ ] is on fish because you want the power as long as your dream

Title: My Response to the $500 Turbo Car Challenge
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vOmJNJfBM

(Start: 00:00:00)
everyone and welcome back to the channel today we're going to discuss the $500 turbo card challenge so I've had roughly a week just to sit down and think about things thinking about everything carefully and also sit down with mates and talk about the situation is it feasible is it not what can we do how can we do it and well let's talk about that quick so this is gonna be a quick casual video no green-screen no flashy lots this is a me talking about the challenge that I got called out to buy 8:02 garage and wideband so first things first the vehicle as it stands is a $500 limit on a car Yonsei Africans get a car that runs for $500 would mean something that's pretty broken we'll need a lot of attention before it actually starts rolling on the road and bum by really I mean someone pushing it but all seriousness a lot of the cause i've been finding for that price mark are just not running at all they either railing Chelsey's or there's

(Start: 00:01:02)
an engine problem number two I don't want anything that's not JDM not Japanese because diehard I mean you my daily is Japanese called Lexus I can't do a project on a golf or when I say golf I mean VW golf or I don't know what else you can get for that price but there's a lot of stuff out there that is going around that prosper it's not what I want to have on the channel as like I said I'm under hot jadianna Japanese now what I have found were a couple candidates that were around that price mark but there were issues where there was head gasket problems or you know some something wrong not not cranking not starting which could be a number of issues and ideally I would need something that's really running on the road driving and not to add all these extra costs on so if you guys remember in the previous video there's a basically what to do what not

(Start: 00:02:04)
to do and how you get mocked and all the challenges in for every hundred dollars you spend on certain part your tongue goes up and you get penalties on certain things and it's just gonna be crazy experiences for me to get something going I was having a chat with tangles there was another YouTube in Australia and there's so much stuff that he can pick up in Australia and his thought actually remember you mentioned I think was like Sentra's and that sort of stuff under $500 basic theatre starlets and stuff like full complete runners nothing wrong with him they would pass your overseas MIT or where I am here to Co are unbelievable here you get an absolute box so for this to have worked I wouldn't need to spin at least a thousand one thousand one hundred US dollars to actually get something as a base now the next part is obviously getting a manifold and parts to turbocharged the car being in South Africa Japanese is said of weird

(Start: 00:03:07)
shipping is expensive for example litter before my FD it came from the United Kingdom and that about 150 pound to get it shipped here within like a week or two so that that's one issue is the shipping it was crazy expensive to get stuff here number two we don't have stuff that we can get off the shelf so for example if I had to get a corona for interest sake there's no off-the-shelf manifolds like in the states you can just go and grab manifold forever because everybody's done it in 50 thousand people have done it yeah different story so everything's custom everything's expensive I had a very kind offer though from here's a free plug for you Russell from rustic race engineering who offered to work on those $500 car challenge with me and I bring the car then he would build manifold everything everything I needed

(Start: 00:04:08)
for the car unfortunately the rules state you cannot use a shop cannot pay for a mechanic if the everything yourself in your own garage and that's why it would be expensive for me so that said I mean stop turbo that would have been easy I've got tears from the Oryx Evans I could strip that but didn't get idea new exhaust manifold for it because the twin-turbo so there's a lot of little issues and niggy bits that are stopping me from doing this channel challenge then that is the short answer I unfortunately won't be doing the challenge but maybe the cat next to me will be doing the challenge because he doesn't shut up so that's the story guys just a quick laid back for the others to let you know what the hell is going on am i entering it unfortunately not if it was involving a little bit more money and maybe a little less busy time of my life so let's say next year around this time maybe you could dirt and I have

(Start: 00:05:12)
some fun of it so at the end of the video I'm gonna say a big good luck to everybody that's entered on earth few people that have I'm filming this on the 1st of June and this is the start date I don't know when I'm gonna get this video out but good luck to everybody go check out the channels each of two garage and wideband links in the description but is the two guys that failed in this challenge and it's a whole bunch of other people that are partaking in it so good luck to all of you and if CK roads are gonna win and I'll see you all in the next video peace

Title: 5 Things EVERYONE hates about the Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQM4nmirpmw

(Start: 00:00:00)
I've been meaning to make this video for plus minus three years now it's just taking me that long to get the car out and talk some crap about it so without further ado this is five things everybody hates about the r32 GTR you may ask why am I getting into the passenger side well that's because voice problems are here so the first one is the most obvious and fortunately for me right I have such a big issue there's a dash bubble that happens to almost every r32 GTR now essentially what happens as this glue that sits underneath here and the glue gets hot when you park the car outside obviously the whole greenhouse effect of the glass please stops being sticky after a while 25 years plus - and the - starts to love to see I can press it down it kind of like sticks but not really luckily my - bubbles not that big there's a quick fix for it I didn't make a video a couple years ago common issues with the r32 GTR that was one of them

(Start: 00:01:00)
and I'll show you guys how to fix it one thing you can do is pop a pen in here inject some glue and then just press it down now that we got that out of the way let's talk about issue number two so if you look at my floor mat over here you'll see there's a bit of a hump well that's rather annoying it's actually easier if you look at it from the driver's side so as you can see there's quite a bit of a Reese lesser than a drop date now the issue for that as the transmission is directly underneath it so they had to make a plan and widen that's odd well you already see let's discuss that's on top of it but it's quite a big hump over here and that sucks it's particularly awkward for a passenger if they're not putting their feet all the way back that can be awkward sometimes now let's move on to number three and four they're both in the engine bay actually as you can see I got the RB 26 that came factory fitted with these models all are 32 3 & 4 GTR models came with the Arbour 26 de TT I'm still rocking the twin-turbo setup and issue number 3 what they call a viscous

(Start: 00:02:02)
fan setup as you can see down there there's a belt that's driving that murder and it spins the fan so once you start the car the fans on it's on pretty much old it however sounds horrific so let me play a little scenario here for you guys you're gonna pull up to a car meet and someone tells you make some noise make some pops make some bangs they want to hear the turbos well you think you're clever stop the car and you start waving the hell out of its low achievers cuz Finn and it's just gonna sound like a truck now a lot of GTR owners have complained about that issue I myself don't like it I like the exhaust sound obviously but for me that's issue number three and I think it affects a lot of people now issue number four is extremely common and a lot of people hate this can you

(Start: 00:03:03)
see what I'm getting at yep the dreaded oil filter location it's all the way and the underneath intake manifold and it is a bloody nightmare just to get your hand in there I mean just take a look at this right so oil filter I got my hand can you see the sauce now I could probably get two fingers around it not to you leave it at the issue what people generally do and what I need to do and I will be doing fairly soon there's an oil filter relocation kit now I've done a battery delete so obviously I've got a lot more space I might put it over here I'm not too over there I don't know but that is an awkward position just to change your oil and change the oil filter that's probably the worst thing on this car and by far the most common to a lot of people that haven't done oil to relocation now for number five I could go technical and I could start listing stuff like the high caste system the 80s system a lot of stuff that girls generally pull out now if you think I was speaking Portuguese there now don't have a falafel to get I was actually referring to the rear-wheel steering the rear wheels induce oversteer over a

(Start: 00:04:05)
certain speed I think it's like thirty kilometres an hour maybe forty kilometres an hour but basically when you're taking a left turn the rear wheels will effectively turn right to make you oversteer no it's not massive I mean if you had to point a camera that you'll barely see it but it's making tiny little increments that make a huge difference however once you start changing tires and you start modifying the cause it becomes an effective and just silly and it's really old tech anywhere I'm going to talk about that much more that is another issue but just a little bit of comedic aspects of this video one of the graphs that I have and I'm pretty sure a lot of people have this issue too is because of r32 GTR because it's a GTR and because everybody knows Paul Walker and fast and furious and it's not a part of the whole Japanese cult scene JDM hey if you know everything everybody on the street wants to race golf sevens golf sixes all the Gulf's they all want to race focus STS Fiesta is T's I mean believe it or not

(Start: 00:05:06)
they're trying race I mean that's cool and all that you're trying but I can't go and race every single person jimmies waste of fuel so that is that gas that is what I feel everybody hates about the or 32 GTR if you enjoy this video please smash that like button hit that subscribe button plenty of JDM content as you can see in the background there's an ORAC 7 ft 3 s yeah and I have any more to sw20 actually have another one of these a black one so if you carefully are 32 GTR perhaps you want to stay for it and the Oryx save and end the mr2 etcetera loads of content loads of JDM stuff happening on the channel appreciate any support if you don't mind share the video guys thank you so much how will see on the next one peace [Music] you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different and you must be kin think you're gonna anyway just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable

(Start: 00:06:07)
irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the bones you gotta take as though you can't be your prototype no more you tell me what do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it I'm gonna - you saw these opinions and all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen that is on fish because you want the power is why is your training

(Start: 00:01:02)
I'm sure if you can see this on the camera but this glitter flying around everywhere looks so cool that's why I can't [Music] looks so damn good off to the second coat so if you happen to pick it out already I'm gonna be doing a gold and purple diamond start the single tuber if d but I gotta go we had some family over now and I had to entertain for a little bit so I gotta continue is another matter any right garrison John right here we're gonna finish off the FD to not what that means is I can finally go get a down pop it's like a car on a flatbed to get a down pot and then drive it back home so we're gonna finish this v-mail to set up fully get it on with brackets we're gonna make some pop work what else we're doing putting hoses why look here and we rewiring the fence and

(Start: 00:02:04)
they're making some extra missing pieces yeah there's a bunch of crap that's still coming out shows redundant they gone ready no only ones gone those brackets that we're taking out and then we extending this because now the indica does move to flush up against here and we just think I should kind of work just to make sure we're relocating the AST getting this car ready for the down pop and road ready is that some yeah getting it ready for the road take it off and put some big one no I'm done okay incoming I'm reaching I'll give you a pair oh yeah five home move and it's gone we should

(Start: 00:03:06)
try yeah one on business might cool it okay guys we just finished this pup here this is how it's gonna look that dough feels rather who I'm doing as a rub down here he's very professional rubbing one out that's a PC or if you say no arms on flexing like the come on you used to the passive so it makes sense because that pops out of the way what are you doing next walk up the radiator put the right arrow in place so we can start cutting the part so guys uh we're gonna move the radiator but now because upside down my pop wig what - cool purple looking pop wig that I bought before I knew I was getting singled server and obviously that's not going to work anymore however I'd like to keep the purple so there's only an extra bin that I needed to do and I need a lengthen up slightly so I picked up this

(Start: 00:04:06)
thing or thanks to my old man he had it as office and we're gonna cut pieces and extend this guy and there's another one there pull the bottom they operate well radiators then made some makeshift brackets actually works out quite well this thing's super steady in the front we need to make up some brackets at the bottom now there's the part that we cut up we chopped off a piece that piece and we actually managed to get it on sitting nasty we had to cut a piece over the radiator with a hacksaw blade somewhere anymore then that cut that piece off now remember this is all temporary until I get my V mount requote radiator it was looking good it means I can start the car drop the car get a down pop my brain into the gear option and then put a v-mail radiator in the months to come so this straight edge that piece is going to go into two pops at the bottom yeah if you can see that this one sort

(Start: 00:05:11)
of that one we might get that right now don't have an angle ground up and cut torch on are not to bring this let's try [Applause] guys I'm gonna meet the card the member we ran out of spring clinch and I remember that my god nut bright the outside broom and I've never chance to get in find you and so I put some finish on it and we about to use those camps in the knee and then I want to show you guys on the blog something I'm not sure if you can see if if I can hang on here but this is what it's looking like underneath the car of put those middle instead it comes on to about yeah and

(Start: 00:06:13)
then they put a clamp there put a clamp there there's no kinks at all and then it's black piece going into the back of the radiator and super ghetto but it's working or like I said there's a little temporary [ __ ] just need to get the car driving again so I can get the dump up mate and then they'll get a proper female radiator you enough making tracks the other yeah if I had that fan we could have finished up to there which means a confident kid I don't know because we need a racist [ __ ] for the shout don't judge me doing some serious backyard mechanic shed because it's like almost 11 o'clock at night now we decided not to pick up the camera for a little bit and just focus on on what's at hand ear radiators

(Start: 00:07:15)
sorted so my temporary stock female radiator is now fixed in place all that shit's done see the camp on there and company too but we got rear it pop everything's sorted out go one more we call it sold ring today this is Johnny's job right you came out the sweet-looking OEM so girls I'm gonna end the vlog here a huge thing to John on at hand Gareth hopefully the next time you see us on the scare out of this car it'll be running and I'll have it down pop thanks so much for watching see you all next video peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different and you must be kidding think you're gonna hate me we just don't get it it's impossible probable irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it no you gotta take us though you can't be a proto what

would have been eight out of ten but it's normally aspirated boring okay we enter the last two cars so this car is and while that belonged to is a African youtuber he's not really uploading that often anymore but used to others Karn used to modify it and we spoke once he called me and talked him through the YouTube game and yeah anyway this was asked our channel name was game on garage and this was his auntie Nancy fatherland nine eight four three three GT is I think I'm sliver of the variance so it's actually videos of him installing these gauges making this panel throwing the panel and I look it's not I like it it used to be an ottoman if

(Start: 00:14:39)
you haven't noticed already on on the cluster and then it's got the big recess yeah so it's got a manual gearbox and now but it was what started life for furs in order which is why I say it's a GTS there's no earth III I love those little key things so the flips that they put your key inside that's pretty cheese good conditioner for cell of a very good condition not much has been done on the body all right so basically still stock sort of its gtst straight-6 near i'll be change for our papers and order with new law since dusk serious earnest only cocoa a little bit too much on los libros for what it is hundred eighty thousand that's twelve

(Start: 00:15:40)
and a half thousand US dollars because I know this car I'm gonna give it a six out of ten and the only reason I'm giving it a six out of ten I'm gonna give it a seven is because they're asking prices a little bit little bit i if you're watching this and you want to drop it down substantially and let me take it home because I go other JDM cause let me know no I'm kidding yeah even ask about the car alright guys moving on to the final one if you made it this far it means that I haven't bought this car and something came up either my wife and said no the car is already sold or I don't know what else could come in the way but as soon as I've finished filming this video like in the next 10 minutes

(Start: 00:16:40)
I'm going to be making contact with liner and maybe they'll be buying it so if you're watching us I didn't get the car it's 296 is chassis is 13 1990 model of DuPont 36,000 right let me show you the process which before you run through photos has nothing $36,000 forty two thousand four hundred eighty two US dollars check this out so dashboard looks great you can see there's like five by three speaker on the bill that looks crappy sense through your radio so that everything was done on the cheap sound was but you don't care about sound when you're buying this car and your dashboard is great it needs a teen you can already see feather duster two and you sorted what he looks okay look straight I'm pretty sure paint would need some issues yeah would need a little bit of a teen up where we spray or something but it's cheap

(Start: 00:17:41)
I like cheap so ever since I've got the mr2 in the black or x7 I mean the the silver heck save and I'm a GTR we're not cheap for the other cars way ever since then I like looking at cheap [ __ ] it's in the front a little bit of ride rash and I don't like the wheels and it's Divini up stock suspension original carpet steering wheel dual quads a little bit bucket seats upright need to be replaced but no honest you'd throw in something like Ricardo broad or I want to scar okay I'm gonna make two out resna just in case it's sold because then I'm gonna surprise you guys in the video with this car so girls and girls thank you so much for watching this video if you're watching

Title: $500 Turbo Car Challenge - Buying my first Honda??
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afqShtVliPY

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys and welcome back to a brand new video last week sometime i got called out by a fellow youtuber known as 802 garage now him and another youtuber called wideband have come up with this thing called the 500 turbo car challenge that's it i don't know too much about it he basically called me out about it like five six days ago i haven't had a chance to even look at it i know there's a video out there's a bunch of rules and i figured what's best then to take a look at it with you guys so there's a little intro video that the guys have put together and then they've got a rule set that we're going to take a quick look at and i'm going to decide whether or not i'm going to partake in this the car is going to cost me about 500 that's the whole plan buyer call 500 turbo the car with whatever means you have cheaply as possible and then there's a bunch of things that i've got to do complete like challenges and stuff and then post my times something like that we'll take a look into the detail so let's take a look at their video and i'm going to react to that

(Start: 00:01:10)
cool little intro so far [Music] that's uh aaron's um 200 sx we don't get those in south africa i've never seen one before i only knew about this because we did a live stream we're chatting about this cough a little bit casey paid for 500 or less for it [Music] that is honda dels oh i think is it it is i think i don't know what someone call me see 206 is er we didn't get that inside [Music]

(Start: 00:02:15)
five hundred dollars for the car five hundred dollars to turbo oh wow okay i may take part in this [Music] you can enter the link in the following description first of all like nine days [Music] doing some skits there bro he's got the sr20de in this car so you've actually got a good platform to to work with a bit of a rust package but you got a good platform dude [Music] i was just i was trying i thought it was gonna be like be 16 or whatever the hell you do on the honda engines also carried sh

(Start: 00:03:19)
okay i hope you enjoyed that little trailer and welcome to the first ever 500 turbo challenge this is something that me and aaron over at 802 garage have talked about for a little while and we finally both had the means to do it and we've invited some other people but we don't know all the participants yet and also if you have a channel you are invited to participate the general thesis here is that you go out and you get a car for five hundred dollars and you boost it as cheaply as possible if i can't get something japanese or jdm for under five hundred dollars i ain't doing this max 500 spent on boosting it obviously you're not going to end up with the best car that way but you are going to have a really good time i'm going to end up with a piece of but yeah could have some fun so let's talk about performance uh these are the performance tests your car will have to pass the first one is a zero to sixty second

(Start: 00:04:19)
one is eighth mile third one is a quarter mile and then finally we'll be doing a zero to sixty to zero now you'll notice these are all straight line performance tests mainly because turbo charging is simply just to increase horsepower so we weren't really going to factor in handling and handling on a 500 car is going to be sketchy at best you're preempting this whole thing two liter turbo catchy at fast then there's gonna be four more challenges we're gonna call these achievements the first one is which car is the cheapest less money spent equals more points for you second one is the dude's actually got pretty decent interior except for this torn seat here i mean look at the dash

(Start: 00:05:19)
it's actually quite neat we didn't get this car in south africa so i'm trying i'm still trying to figure out what it is i think it's a dell cell a daily driver class whichever car you would actually daily drive uh we're gonna have people vote on that to decide who wins that uh third is gonna be how good does your car sound which car makes the best turbo noises or exhaust noises again we're gonna have that be decided by voting and the fourth one is the haggard challenge which would be which car is the most mint uh we're kind of leaving that one up in the air you can decide what mint means to you i thought he was gonna drive into that manifold on purpose for the video and again that one will also be decided by voting right i hope you guys enjoyed this video and we already have a handful of potential entrants but as we get closer to the date me and aaron over at 802 will also release he's got an mrt in the back full list

(Start: 00:06:20)
of entrants before june 1st which is the first date that videos will be slated for release thanks guys i hope you're as pumped about this challenge as i am about locking my friend terry inside this trunk all right i think we can do this no of course i spoke to my wife about this beforehand and uh told her i'm gonna possibly enter and bring a piece of home but then i'll get rid of it after the challenge she's okay with it so let's find something but first i want to take a look at the rules and make sure that everything's okay where are the rules there you go google docs

(Start: 00:07:21)
all right i'm not going to run through this in a lot of detail competition first june [Music] base card you want anyone to be able to encourage sticking to the budget there will be a small pair into your middle and your cars over 500 that's what i'm afraid of what am i going to get in south africa for 500 because that's not a lot of money here five hundred dollars herbert okay so i'm assuming that includes ecu everything  okay let's forget about that one uh any performance most of the vehicles have recorded we don't know something that goes into it okay tracking very requires me if it is a challenge that's easy-ish if i have time i'll make sure i have some friends having fun is acceptable the channel owner should do most of the work

(Start: 00:08:25)
on your shops anywhere all right they've already mentioned all the challenges [Music] uh penalties here we go for every hundred dollars over the 500 car 0.16 so 0.1 seconds will be added to your time for every 100 every dollar will be included rounded to the nearest whole dollar so 655 1.5.0155 seconds added to each time so you can go over on the turbo side 100 one second same story you know i could probably get away with the parts because i can get parts quite cheap here and obviously it'll be mostly secondhand but the car okay i want to do this challenge let's just see what if it's not jdm japanese i'm not if you have three brakes in here be disqualified from little related challenges yes exclusions okay blah blah blah

(Start: 00:09:26)
uh cool i will ask aaron for more details if i need let's do this now we use a website here called gumtree in south africa and well it's probably the most reputable one when it comes to selling cars and i've found the easiest way without me sifting through all this let me give you an example if i have to go to gumtree and say automotive vehicles cars search for all now i gotta find something local to me which is kzn because if i had to go fetch it and let's say johannesburg or something that's going to add another 150 200 to the price so that's not gonna work anyway cars bucky's a bucky is a van or ute

(Start: 00:10:28)
if you guys wanted to know a little bit of youtube's information okay so you know i'm going to skip all these pages that say negotiable because it shows that at first i want all the cheap i'm on page 14 already okay people starting with 1000 now let me show you how much there's a thousand bucks in my currency 500 times 14.5 check dollar two round so dollars around is 14.4 at the moment so we'll just say 14.5 so 500. is seven thousand rand plus minus bloody hell let's say seven five hundred aaron if you're watching this and i do participate just give me a little lever here of like twenty dollars please hmm

(Start: 00:11:32)
yeah that's not too grand it's not bloody irritating because when i go on here there's people advertising like this polo for three thousand rand which is like two hundred dollars but it's not for sale for that that's how much you're going to pay monthly if you have to finance it so like come excuse everything up here you missed a zero it pisses me off so the only way for me to really find stuff is to be more specific so carlsen bucky's low price project and then filter below and this will give me all the stuff for well the amount we're really looking for now okay what we got yeah i got a beetle i had a beach buggy i got a volvo i have a honda and that's a writing chassis i'm just skim reading we'll open everything up in a sec opal astro

(Start: 00:12:34)
beetle and that's it that's my limit so if i did it'll be a penalty i don't know what penalty will be so probably for every hundred dollars it'll be one second so let's say i'll stop there at 8 500. that's what i get for 300 300 i think 300 is 4 500 i'm pulling up the calculator just by the way 14.5 that's 310 us dollars for this hunk of junk beach buggy god i'm skipping all this crap i refuse to do anything non jdm non-japanese i need a haircut just saying hundred percent we'll come

(Start: 00:13:35)
back to that could be my saving grace i'm so keen on making this challenge but i'm not um people astra uh let's just look at it for shit's sake so april astra i want to sell it is not driving no battery has a computer box problem i have a new computer box so i'll give it with no papers also license is behind no no not much waste of time upside down car good job dude unfinished project can stop but starter needs repairs what the hell i had engine replacement exhaust needs to be reconnected okay ford escort no engine no gearbox no papers goodbye old school beetle project how's gearbox

(Start: 00:14:37)
no engine i started the mess at 66. so this is a hundred dollars over budget let's look at pictures first first of all it's i don't know rolled someone stood on the roof secondly i can't drive this thing on the road i get pulled over very quickly it's like parked in a ditch unfinished product driving but engine needs tlc drivery away on the cheap saving grace before i look at everything 6 000 people have seen this

(Start: 00:15:38)
let's got 230 000 kilometers 1991 model and oh geez slash and i've read the description carl's not running has a bearing knock everything is there and working you can actually drive it if you start it but obviously has a bearing knock so spun bearing pull the head new bearings that's really more cost this actually would work quite well as a project [Music] i don't know i'm not gonna make any rash decisions now i'm gonna end off this video guys let me know what you think is this the car should i use this for the project car should i maybe leave it i did chat to aaron about this this thing briefly last week and i said off the bat like when i started this video i said five hundred dollars not a

(Start: 00:16:40)
lot of money and i'm not gonna buy you a decent car to work on as a project and he said look next time next year maybe they'll do the same thing they'll up the ante a little bit so maybe then i'll join i don't know you guys let me know in the comment section should i make contact with the owner of this car it's also a little bit far northern suburbs para so it'll probably cost me a good 200 250 plus minus to get the car to where i am i don't know guys give me some advice here let me know what you think i'm gonna leave it to that thank you so much for watching see you all next video peace

Title: Everything went horribly wrong! RX7 FD3S Wiring
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibf0UFi5ZbY

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey what's up guys and welcome to the vlog this vlog went horribly wrong I tried filming this about three weeks ago three different times three different days or four different days and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse so the whole premise behind the vlog was for me to show you that I'm finishing up my wiring on the FD closing up the interior panels making everything nice and neat mounting the HKS boost controller just getting everything sorted and closing up the interior and then that's finished done and dusted so the first time I go to the carriage I'm working on the car 20 minutes in plus minus daughter starts crying she's sucky Kahnawake in the car any longer had to go inside and we at the hospitals doctors blah blah so basically I wasn't able to finish anything I did a little bit of the wiring cleanup I chucked some wires behind the back of the panels and all that stuff I didn't get to close up anyway - three days post - Motorola Tomlin zero a while ago two or three days plus - I tried again went into the

(Start: 00:01:01)
garage and well this time I was able to finish all the wiring closed up the panel's I was in gonna stop mounting the HKS boost controller and all the other toys inside getting them fixed properly and I was being a little bit lazy and stupid let me show you how and why so like I said I was busy sorting out all the wiring everything is pretty much closed up and that I just need a tuck underneath and then put my electronic toll control system probably no didn't just throw it it's my knee rubbing against the door EFC and all the goodies just tuckered wire in and I'm done now I'm kind of like lying down over here somewhere as you can see the wall is right here and there's no much space so I was like lying down in here working underneath and on the seat I had a pair of scissors and a pair of side cutters and I needed to cut some of the cables I was working with and I couldn't reach because I'm not a contortionist I was being [ __ ]

(Start: 00:02:03)
lazy so what did I have in front of me that try to cut one cable tie and when wrought into my thumb come on focus super deep it's been like a week and a half plus - since that happened so it has closed up I should have gone and got the stitches I decided to try and carry on the vlog and then my daughter started crying she got sick again so anyway long story short cut my thumb open pretty badly decided to carry on working on the car that didn't happen and anyone just bandage it up team that I've been cheated up but I've ended up with went the next day to the doctors they said all the nurse and she set up probably should have gotten some stitches and quando now because the skin's all wet and it look like an old granny's thumb so couldn't do anything they put some

(Start: 00:03:07)
steri-strips or something that like seal it it was like some dissolvable stitches and closed it up anyway it looks a lot better actually looks pretty bad but better than what it was I've decided I've got all the footage I need to show you guys that I'm almost finished so I decided to do some pro work and I whipped up the old green-screen lotting big camera and decided to sit down and the rate sit and talk to you guys about the whole plan and and all that [ __ ] and what happened daughter start crying again she's been really sick the last three weeks so he managed to figure out the problem which was awesome we had some x-rays and ultrasound done and I'm not gonna go into details where there was all personal stuff but she is so much happier now things are a lot better but wasn't there what's freaking get this blog out I've been meaning to get this vlog out and I've been means work on

(Start: 00:04:09)

Title: JDM Cars for sale in South Africa - Carlos Sainz ST185 Celica #EP2
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTE8PZK23sM

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to a brand new video today we're going to be looking at JDM cars for sale in South Africa this is episode number 2 we're going to do one of these once a month there's just not that many JDM cars for sale here so once a month that's what it's gonna be so the first car that we have on the screen has a tiara silica is t105 it's the college saints limited edition number two non 30 out of 5000 ever built this is the European UK version the Japanese version was the RC model so it's a 2-liter turbo foil steering four-wheel drive and it's got a water to here intercooler that's pretty cool car this one used to be mine like this actual car this is the only one in South Africa I sold it but eight years ago plus - probably should never sold it I sold it for a lot less than what the guys are asking for now we're not gonna CC much on this but so I bought the car little while ago and the plan was to restore it and get back to optimum

(Start: 00:01:00)
condition and just keep it things came up I was young and stupid and I sold the car and thinking I'll just get another one in the future that never happened well turns out to stay in once Africa and a subscriber he's probably watching us right now his father used to in this exact car and we made contact recently and he said hey that was his dad's car blah blah blah used to be my car crazy stuff so his dad imported from overseas brought it into the country and I'll ended up buying it they often you know it's for sale now with a lot of stuff and the dudes pulled out the engine he's done a lot of stuff going to read through those you can pause the video take a look he's got a GTE 3582 turbo he's got a whole lot of stuff and with regards to the internals of the engine very very cool car he doesn't have a lot

(Start: 00:02:01)
of photos on him he's actually adding on to photos of the car so most the car when I used to own it I don't know what it looks like now this is the day that I actually bought up this interior picture so it was missing this little trim thing yeah but I did get a new one yaniv I don't remember if I change something I got around to it but I had the route through the mats recon and came out really well the Indian male was horrific when I first got it may I have a picture of the engine when I first got out one second there was engineering our first college Mozza great so look at that midnight on the picture 2013 io 720 2021 taken from an iPhone 4s okay so I 2013 and then I place the order for the GTR at the end

(Start: 00:03:02)
of 2013 so I sold us in 2013 anyway this is model car there's Mahalo subir in the background and we spend too much time with us right that was model car very cool I miss my granny and well he's moving on next colleague coach has of our GT nutless is an import version and I'll tell you why we had a spec called the GT turbo essentially was the same as any other GC a WRX out there the JDM version now we received us it was an Australian spec car and we referred to as the GT GT turbo ej20 turbocharged four-wheel drive all the bells and whistles this is a 96 we only got ours 98 97 98 it looks different when you when you start looking at the interior there's a

(Start: 00:01:12)
[Music] so what happened is I went down today fellas my family this one holiday as a 19 year old kid looking for a sports car one of my uncle's actually said they bolt the squad killer in a race wave it was a tie right and smash was for a TV show called testimo right okay so yeah he has a little kid I ran up to the bank I said listen give me cash and ya shifted up from Kate on Mars it didn't have the wing it didn't have the diffuser it did come with the wide-body kid already on it robbery but when they repaired the snack and I did get the 19-inch BBS's with it there is moss these are cooler and better come in the same color there's no no I actually had them respray they were sort of flat man

(Start: 00:02:12)
that okay that's a that's a vortex look yeah so what actually happened is I phoned up the people in Cave Johnson Carbon sport right unfortunately couldn't get the vortex defuser that I wanted to put my car because of the way buddy kid the chassis is all moved under there so they gave me a one of course based off loosely another guy Joe gray so I took the pasta to Ross champion they basically did a full skeleton EXO gold on the inside and yeah onto the face of the casting off so cool looks awesome what wing is off this is the limo beast back to wing it came just as two-piece wing I bet one day my backyard and I wrap it up looks awesome this is also rap on the Sun brought what's done power was so basically it's full bolts on any mechanical ball phone that you can get I have plane iam space has intake spaces it has a unique chip system the cue system coilovers all around and yeah basically the that's our

(Start: 00:03:14)
for not which is quite long how much power you're making I did it on PC TSS diner I've pushed 171 kilowatts for the wheels that little have the tune unfortunately at that stage but when I had spoken to the guys and I bought the car they said it's roughly about 248 right but they're there Donna is pretty stingy anyway engine by the way you have is a vq35de and yeah this is an aftermarket radiator because the old cooling system couldn't keep up in traffic it would overheat

(Start: 00:04:15)
intake I try to stick with a blue look this red cable that you see here this is an override system for the cooling all the fans so if you come off the track and you need to do a cool-down you don't actually need to do a cool of course flip the switch from the glovebox well that makes sense that's cool and the or coilovers on the car yes you are they yellow pro speeds they pro speed dynamics currently not a bit janky I need to get them refurbished sway bars in America no not at this stage just the queries on the pension brakes I mean you're running the stock Prima's these things up they awesome I had these a master Barrett and they stopped really well how much does the car way so that's one thousand eight hundred kilos just over right so but this cars got off the market fuel saw so I think I got half of the cube capacity that a stock Z has was just to save weight so I got no air conditioning in the car on purpose it was on purpose at that stage but not to get it redone it's a bit of a slip yeah so I'm taking my time with that as part of the plans that I want to do so you do

(Start: 00:05:16)
want to put it back in okay I'm busy taking mine out I'm alright seven interior was so I went crazy for the interior the common z problem is that the actual door panel starts scratching so to solve that are wrapped it in carbon fiber as well is the same - i've gear knob in the shape of a skull she got that from china walls like a keyboard eventually I want to do an aerial delete at the back so I have this temporary aerial system running in so I can think of radio stations for now okay and y'all doubled and DVD in the sensor so what's your future plans in the car so basically this is eventually not going to be my daily park so I don't to get a daily and I'm gonna completely turn us into what I wanted it to be it's going to have a full roll cage on the inside I'm gonna order from racing seats for us as far as performance goes we're doing a turbocharger kits so eventually you'll have a chat to Nick oh we're going to be

(Start: 00:06:18)
doing the logs together okay yeah so forced induction for weight saving and yeah roll cage one thing we forgot you do have an exhaust right now that's correct yes and you can make pops and banks straight to the back it's only got two boxes right at the back of the decaf so all the way from the engine manifold everything's done correct yeah okay so not one piece is standard on the exhaust no that's sick car thank you so much what do we got - what year is this tell me a little bit about the car I've got a 2006 listen 350 said River Edition before you carry on what's the river position the river is well in 2003 2004 with the first 250 shells I came out there with the standard they only rev up to about I think it's five and a half four remember correctly quicker and then the river perdition they added on extra 500 rpm give you better extra legs they're soft but that's and then from

(Start: 00:07:18)
our seven onwards with the HR model okay [Music] so I believe you've just got an exhaust on the car there are yeah that's right okay cool what's I mean just an exhaust there must be future plans oh yeah tell me little brother well I'm basically trying to pull it up as a drift car that's that's the ultimate goal so next I want to do rooms in coilovers and then angle care at the fronts on a roof front bumper or if you know at mlz what I'm going with do I want to do that front bar in and then hopefully in the future I'll be able to drop a 2j in here with a single turbo a little be nice to have a 600 horses there's a teacher swap commonly not too common I've only seen a handful of them that have been done but they use be yes looks

(Start: 00:08:25)
awesome love doing what are yours at the joy father's 35th anniversary model okay what's the difference between lust and the repetition pretty much this this model yeah came with spoilers it came with the back but gods was a little bit different the difference in timing slightly but other than that still stop standard haven't changed much on it just got the exhaust decanter quicker but at the moment all I've done to deserve actually pull that stock flour will average stage to race in clutch most flour wheel okay I don't know myself okay my next four your mechanic portrayed oh yeah not bad shape oh but my father actually took me since I like most like I cook took me six hours to see what my plan for this car is pretty much I want

(Start: 00:09:26)
to go turbo I'll do it myself okay I'm going to be pushing at least 550 500 what's this boss yeah and then plans I mean oh you're gonna be tracking the car you're gonna be doing mainly drifting and drifting oh yeah yeah I'm more interested in have you drifted before yeah okay more interested in putting the car sideways and so it's not a daily drive it is at the moment actually next next next this year I'm looking at buying just has a pair more practical car and I'll keep this for that track a little bit of support car for those yeah yeah pretty much I'll put a trailer bring a trailer okay moss but yeah ultimately in the end will come down to a Tuesday once a populist right you know he was just saying no that's that's gonna be cool that's gonna be damn cool yeah otherwise

(Start: 00:10:28)

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] [Music] [Music] that's about enough space to work put my fed Esther you see what I mean there's quite a gap here yeah and then this side

(Start: 00:01:00)
as the most prominent see that one's going in one swoop it I don't know what's causing the issue I've never looked try to figure out how we can do it in every spray on this car that's not now later other stuff to do it I'll across the way about like that one soon from us [Music] that thing so it's a kill switch for my battery installed us on this car because well quite frankly I don't use it very often so it's best just to kill the battery on it's a hell of a mission take the spare wheel up and then let's connect the battery on a marquee MRX you guys would have one of these you understand so those of you that follow me on instagram probably wondering one of the cause sitting out there for like two weeks well good reasoning the passenger side front bob had an issue we I took up the wheel studs because initially I thought that the car needed longer wheel studs

(Start: 00:02:01)
because of these wheels and law and wheel spaces that wasn't the case of straight up ball tunnel but I did take them out in the passenger side and when I had to flip them back in I kind of knocked the track dust cover thing a little bit too far in and was scraping on the disk every time there was rotation so I left the car there and then my daughter's been sick we've been in hospital again twice more once this week once last week it's been a it's been a crazy ride anyway and cost sorted out now head over Tom two days ago fixed it up and I'm just want to sort of the headlights and I'm gonna pocket back on the cover and then like I said focus on this thing get the down part made up get this con the road because it's gonna be a super fun ride okay first things first is we're gonna take those screws they're not bolts it's a big guessing game for me just by the boss he's bear with me so that's a Phillips head screwdriver what you need for this little different on another car see there's a washer on there

(Start: 00:03:02)
that's true shouldn't be on the car that's like a household screech recovered that one's right that one's not a little bit up in the middle some more screws on this side let's get skill you're not doing anything maybe that's from inside probably this one okay I'm not doing anything either so it looks like you just got to take this cover up first and then you can get to the headlights off yeah skiers doing so a quick shout out to the it works us blow I've been trying to contact you try to get me to do in the club I wanna see it I don't know what's happening off boy drains the battery I managed to find out who my real friends where we're not stopped using what's up these touch with people

(Start: 00:04:03)
people are generally too cheap to sms/text one chord and two cheats pick up the phone so good riddance - what's up couples out I was pretty simple and just looking at that there's some adjustment bolts inside yeah see that that should look at the cover up so the back end was too far down so we have to lift it up so this is gonna be a serious trial and error things let me just fast forward a couple minutes without keeping you guys waiting on cam alright those piece up first of all it looks so much better already this is a little bit too high as you can see there can you see I'm not sure this one needs to go down so sloppy up

(Start: 00:05:09)
oh no there's a problem that's not good let me figure that out oh yeah that whole thing's loose this is doing [Music] [Music] it's certainly a lot better there's a little bit of a gap there like an actual headlock unit itself needs to move this way and that still needs to go up slightly there Apollinaire she's even though it's raining it's like 28 degrees outside in probably 30 inside Magaro so I'm sweating like a pig I wish I was recording I can turn it off sort of save some battery but look I

(Start: 00:06:10)
have a little bit of a hunch and the Huntress to do at the bonnet I check this out I managed to get the bonnet a little bit more down so a little bit of a gap in exposing the middle then it opens up a little bit more on that side I've managed to get up towards the headlights good now the way I did there I realized look take a look on this side and I realize that these bolts on here we've grounded or ground from using for your the wrong side socket or the wrong side spin out just abuse and the paint so from these guys here so I realized someone's been tampering with the bonnet and readjusted the bonnet so figure it out start to get the bonnet rock and then way from the HID lights again so I'll fix the bonnet I'm gonna pop this headlight up sloppy and tuck it back a little bit more and then get this one across but we're on the wrong track here things looking much better than the way before yeah I think we did well now

(Start: 00:07:14)
I can see the bonnet still not having personal on so it was better than before but not hundred percent so here it's a little bit too close to the bumper and there's a little bit too much of a gap on this side I'm guessing the issue would probably be this side here this needs to come over to the denim on and on the middle all the color justice I think I'm done for now I'm sweating so bad near Hobart to human Broca's well that's up for the vlog hope you enjoyed the video it was pretty boring abyss just readjusting the hit lots at least I got it to a point really cause a little more presentable now just history spray and don't stop doing some other cool stuff in the meantime there's gonna be a few more vlogs upcoming and we're gonna have another garage knock with Gareth and John oh if you weaken the Oryx even finalizing a couple things and then getting it back onto the rightful shooting and then the GTR is another story I'll get into that single to where story and that's pretty much it so guys thank you so much for watching I'll see all the next video Jess you're never

(Start: 00:08:16)
gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different and you must be kin think you're gonna hate it we just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it domes you gotta take as though you can't be your prototype no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do all these positions they come in and millions they Park in your vision but you can't listen that's it is all fiction cuz you want the powers while you're dreaming

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the video a very special day today because i'm sitting with this 200 sx behind us i have the owner and the builder of this car and we're going to run through what has been done to it and why it's so special and i'm going to show you guys some awesome footage that we managed to capture with the stunt driver in botswana i want it all i get to buy it i told her she gotta come try it they wondering what i've been doing uh

(Start: 00:01:00)
[Music] lucky i never got trapped in the cubicle if i did it then you can do it too just follow my moves stacking my cash in abundance all of my family funded finally got what i wanted life is amazing i love it everyone know that i run it yeah my family home for the holidays i'm in the studio cooking up music cause i know i never got time to waste this a decision i gotta make all right so most of you guys watching this right now will be very familiar with this car in a left-hand drive spec this is the south african 200 sx you guys would have it as a 240 sx if you're watching from overseas in the united states now this particular one is no ordinary 200 sx there is a lot done to it and we're just going to start with

(Start: 00:02:02)
the suspension side so first of all there's coilovers on the car it's got some lenser wheels on it so project d wheels these are 17's it's got two two fives 45 17's in the front and then two three fives in the rear this car sticks like it drives really really well so with regards to the interior we've got stock seats for now the owner does have a sparkle seat and the sparker seat is going to be coming out very shortly but sparker's steering wheel nismo gear lever it's got new leathers on the way the carpets have been redone in this car so as you can see here the dash all these trim panels they're all carbon fiber this is not stuck on this is carbon fiber mold the real deal right here even got on the door cards i mean this stuff looks absolutely gorgeous [Music]

(Start: 00:03:02)
all right guys i'm here with the owner duran and russell from rustic engineering who helped build a vehicle okay so this is uh a 93 i've had it for about four years um this is actually my second 200 sx the first one i had was a terrible one russell actually came over and saw it was like what a bad car so we ended up selling that and i needed another one everyday car so i purchased this from a friend of ours the martian carpenter that originally had a c18 motor that had originally a c18 motor we put in the sr20 holder conveyor put in an sr20 yeah and i dailed the car for about two three years until the turbo went and uh wrestled the night it's basically where he came in yeah all right well let's fast forward then pretty much um always been into class together all the way through through our school um at one point we even swapped cars yeah yeah pulled into uh dodie's house one day in the morning wanted

(Start: 00:04:09)
i ended up swapping it for mach 3 supra so just continue the friendship until it got to a point where dory found me up one day i was like listen uh my car's giving me and i need to i need to fix it and we just saw after smoking on the asl 20 i'm not coming right that ended up uh turning into an entire rebuild of the car and engine swap transmission swap uh touch up take out any minor rust that was on the vehicle and just really turn it into something special that uh you could be part product yeah all right let's take a look at the engine bay here and see what we've got so russ help me out yeah yeah we got a 1j here that's a 2.5 has it been forged is it a stock bottom end so pretty much what it is is this is a x-race motor came out of my old drift car and what had happened at the time is when uh when we built it we've done a custom turbo turbo manifold on it custom t3 t4 turbo small exhaust goal for quick boost um teal

(Start: 00:05:11)
wastegate recirculating back into the custom downpipe and free flow exhaust all stainless work we've got uh 63mm hot boost pipe uh front mount intercooler we've got a crosstalk radiator on here and outside of that you've just got your your standard 1jz vbt motor we're running a sprint 500 heltec on it keep everything in line it's got a external fuel pressure regulator but what we've done here which really gives the car a bit of magic is we've coupled it to a 350z six-speed transmission so at rustec what we do is we actually manufacture a kit for it it's become quite a popular conversion for for guys to do the ratios are just right you really get to deliver the power that the engine makes and yeah outside of that the only other thing is the electronic boost controller and that's run by the health team all right so in terms of performance just upping the boost nothing else really i mean it's already

(Start: 00:06:12)
making power you made 232 kilowatts so 300 horsepower is that on the wheels yes that's pretty impressive i mean we saw it already on the road with that stunt driver but it was amazing i haven't personally met him so i mean guys uh if you're looking for it uh then i am but now we've got performance out of the way and the interior what are your plans for the outside of the car i didn't want to go with the body kit but looking at how well the car came off from rustic we decided to keep it standard but the long term goal would possibly be to go rocket bunny kids okay so some serious stuff on here yeah just whether to keep it original and jdm neat and tidy or give it some flavor all right russ and duran thank you so much for bringing the car here for me it's been an absolute pleasure filming it i'm sure you guys had fun too guys any last words do you want to say anything to the vlog and to each other i think i want to give a quick thanks to russell and that's tech for the world start to finish polo governor for he's got such a wealth of knowledge on

(Start: 00:01:01)
cool my scar looks given what so this cost for sale four hundred thousand around $28,000 it's got a huge parser sixty-two thousand kilometers on the clock or left that's legit cuz I did see something here you got the 320k power cluster thing is it really 62 babies a hundred 962 I don't know I built my turn that's a good sign GT 3072 gin too great to ever met a redhead fuel rail roll gravy cams trust some Ariel oil pump to put a decent speck less and a big spectacle II with a crack windscreen nice car could be a good price if you in the states need to bring it across we wake him no audio so let's just move on to the next one next one's a GT t-34 I have no idea how I got the car is they registered I've mentioned in the past

(Start: 00:02:02)
week on Ridge the non GTRs unless you live overseas for a period of 12 months and you're in the car for 12 months then you can bring pretty much anything you want across probably the case with us what I'm not going to argue the fact so he's got radar codec doesn't skyline GGT they for it's a head-turner blah blah he's replaced the turbo serviced and we started to strip the car for a full nut and bolt shown on restoration case what doesn't calipers shock support from journey at 190,000 read 100,000 renders like seven thousand US dollars I think without the calculator yeah seven thousand seven hundred US dollars where are we 25 minute and it is si registered looks like a little bit dusty it's alright I mean I'm not a fan mom GTR r34 I mean I actually I do like a

(Start: 00:03:06)
gtst GTS etc in our 32 for more 33 for however 34th look odd if they don't have the full GTR kit oh that's nice okay I see what you're saying yes they spin one hundred 9k seven thousand dollars on thus and some shocks those shocks those dolls are cooler was it on the clock wonder if it's on the call anyway maybe on 220,000 Rand that gives you 2 2015 thousand US dollars as a way that I wouldn't pay that much for a non GT I'm not GTR but each day I still get car probably get better performance in my car door what do you say like 500 kilowatts no that

(Start: 00:04:09)
was that we got a car I don't know how many kilowatts are moving on it's 14 listen so they're a very long I'm just quickly checked in these ads I haven't seen all of them and we're just running through this as we're getting along this cars got 175 thousand kilometers on it it's kept on car to your gold was the matter County ready for will change okay Caldwell budget so yeah so he's done this in two thousand kilometers on the rebuilt engine cars in his name which is great and he's gonna pay break up to 2019 November he's got to speak he's he's going to so 22 ute wasn't a fourth person Conrad scratch-off big shopping las garras GT 3071 are so this was probably like the first back one of the GTX series budget II dump valve external wastegate edge case it says QV dump valve

(Start: 00:05:12)
it's got a pixie RFC mas I'm not loving you guys hates it but I like it it's old-school stuff and I know it doesn't do all the stuff that a hell Tech does and everything else for whatever I still like it he's going to great detail this place I like this so cool post car looks like a sleeper from the outside for sure sleeper that is cool I like this take a look at the insides of sparkle we always got the pill amounts of gauge pods East Coast Park IKEA knob this looks like a a VCR it picks the a VCR I don't see the power if see hand controller says probably just the ECU in the car who knows full day the interior yeah what am i sell the car yes it does devil's unprogressive methanol kit cool very cool

(Start: 00:06:17)
I totally get those cars as difficu 460k I think your test you think it's like $10,000 you know 1,400 OHS yeah good for us for what it is moving on I remember this is rocky and rock car before I forget what the left-hand drive is 14 Kukoc 95 next moving into super I haven't actually seen this ad at all short enough the first time singing right hate drakensberg middle of nowhere Taylor Supra it's good friend one-eyed scooter from what I can see two Jets he cheated by men cool so listen throttle buddy big ass looks like a sheet T X 42 something 4285 big hundred melon like oh let's see it's

(Start: 00:07:19)
a ridge GT engine I guess it wasn't too jazzy GT yeah I guess I was probably the twin turbo variant initially so that's the GTX 22 I got that much rather than to get the rest of the trim rock but anyway he has been whit's got to Sydney to brown prior Brian growl cam Brian crowler cams stop sending retainer a rape kit prime growl again Fortune 1000 6 bt 56 trimming gearbox quota monster clutch so distance big cluster pretty good I mean I'm sure this thing makes a hell of a lot of powerful being a 2j I like it what in one one for the press things this would be like $3,000 40,000 14 anyone 400 it's actually 14 point for

(Start: 00:08:21)
that but whatever 14 was easier moving on mr2 I've seen this ad and no offense to the seller but I think you slightly must LED so in the ad you've got that it's collectible car which cool they are that's for you says the GTS model and then you say where was it original to lead a normal normal as per in a non turbo theater engine see this should be normally aspirated not ever and then somewhere in here might have been an old ad when was that posted in January okay you've probably edits at the ad but it used to say 3s GTE and half and then it still said normally aspirated or normal aspirin on tablets your engine this is a GT model of GTS with 3s GE so it's not really

(Start: 00:09:25)
collectible and that's a lot of money for you honor I believe this ad was at a hundred and thirty thousand rand initially far as I remember price has been dropping steadily I mean the car does look like it's in pretty decent condition unless the steering will look right for us the the interior looks pretty good these seats on the legitimate didn't come with leather seats that was redone I mean and threat does look good but that's a hell of an asking cross in all honesty I mean there's a 3sg you can see from a mile away in all honesty this cost probably with about 65,000 ran maximum not because I have one of not knocking on you it's just under the value of this thing and you're gonna be paying about one hundred and twenty thousand rand upwards for a stock standard GT what model but three

(Start: 00:10:31)
is G the 3s g te ver variant with its over 120 up so I mean ami hatefulness expensive plus you got two hundred one thousand kilometres in 1990 I paid half the price for Moen well this off the brass right moving on very swiftly I've been considering this car and I decided not to get it I wanted it for myself 60,000 and before we get into this thing on you can already see one of those 60,000 I know a lot of money is $4,285 for a Veilside or examine fd3s you cannot register this one on the right because it can cross border the cars got no papers for it there's also no mater there's no care box no paper so probably crustless u2 or Namibia or wherever South Africa into

(Start: 00:11:32)
South Africa illegally and a car like this unfortunately yeah we have to bring it in as a collector's item the way I didn't both of marek Stevens and that was getting in RCS paperwork I'll take paperwork and a whole lot of other stuff approved prior to actually getting the vehicle landed in the country at the port and it's a long long and hard process and you know you got to drop emotions out of everything because not my first one that I imported it was scary and you know you kind of just got to go with the flow and and work on the Japan time because they're they pretty relaxed over there to biast and anyway because McConnell here thankfully and they they both registered and GTR it actually all the cars registered which is which is great but this car unfortunately caught corn anymore especially that is in the

(Start: 00:12:33)
country if it was in Botswana I want to see to everybody came from then maybe you could still make a plan but it's here now I can't do anything that being said it is fail sod if do Veilside kit on an FD it looks crazy so cool and it's super cheap like I said four thousand two hundred US dollars rolling chassis I mean I could literally just take everything off and throw it onto muscle the f-d-a thing out the black on is that water back onto the silver aft end and I'm done I mean I just need to get the front headlights apparently I believe he's got the bumper he said something that the dash was missing but I would see if had threads onto my silver aft then wouldn't need anything look at the OD crap bells on reason are you watching and I know you went to scar so it feels hard 50 right

(Start: 00:13:37)
moving on to the next one we're a Mitsubishi 3000gt Health's the left-hand drive one that I found on our website called OLX there's a local car and it's been registered in South Africa so we had a rule that I think came into place in 2004 2005 might be off in the years but we no longer are allowed to import any left-hand drive vehicles at all into Zaire ago and well prior to that people could so this car was he landed a while ago before 2004 2005 and it was registered somehow so the person probably ended in Europe way about an actually no this car came from butts lifts and drops pick left and drive to manual - really good asking price for what it is Oh for for me rather I mean if I had to borrow the japanese auctions i wouldn't be able to bring it on because it's not enough collectors are time lost which sucks but pretty cheap because it's had its

(Start: 00:14:39)
registered engine where looks great it's just super dusty but i mean it's everything is hair stock such a hot engine bay take this car that's a really really good-looking car Thank You missing one tailpiece yeah yeah was so nice pretty cheap hmm No all right papers in order to connect connections add some really fun trainers welcome I think it's actually sitting in a dealer pictures again look at the raffle range automotive rifle range garage I don't know CG Auto Apeco all right well there's a cheap USDM or

(Start: 00:15:41)
euro left and drive 3000 GT not ever this is the 3 litre v6 rear-wheel drive Montera still great great great platform to work with and finally moving on to probably in the rough from the well side but anyway this chat box for 25 grand I'm sorry go back to this thing so this thing a 60 B 60 thousand foot that's 48 v it's the same process the facade car and then this thing when I was 25 seventeen hundred US dollars a hundred thousand kilometres miles ich das manners needs to refill few to refit fuel tank pump needs to be replaced new tires - tough to recover attention was to rebuild paper I can order office invited so they'll probably take a

(Start: 00:16:42)
little bit Allah I don't know if there's an engine in this card enough there's a draft train this car is up on stance I'm really not sure but it is licensed and it was legal it was cool if you into this all the spec Supra but I'll probably give us a mess to be honest it right guys that's the end of the school series this was looking at JDM cars in South Africa I don't know if we'll make this into full-on series we are maybe do this once a month let me know in the comments section just something where I can sit down and talk to you guys and show you what's for sale and so Africa I mean this is pretty much the extent of the JDM cause that I'll see some of these causing for self a little while now some of them have well someone what year I think what the GTR was listed recently and yeah I mean you know the comments section we can always do this again another song girls and girls thank

(Start: 00:17:43)
you so much for watching see you on the next video peace Ramazan go away peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different and you must be kidding think you're gonna hate it we just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop it knows you gotta take us though you can't be a prototype no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it too you saw these opinions and all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen the cities on fish because you want the power as long as you're dreaming

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the vlog I have a special surprise I finally got some new wheels for the mr2 after doing that little feature if you guys haven't watched it check out a link in the description under the future of an mr2 sw20 had Tom's front bumper Tom's rear bumper whole bunch of cool stuff the car looked awesome and I was sitting on SSR wheels forgot which ones it's in the video go check it out so I got a little bit jealous I'll be honest and thought it was time to upgrade so right now we've been load sheared if you are not in South Africa you might know that means basically our electricity is cut off run now for a period of two hours something's going on apparently a whole bunch of generating power plants are down and the government doesn't have any money to fund our that I was going on anyway don't want some eager Ethan years I'm down 40 hours I can't charge this camera and splashing read it's about to die so I have to film all those crappy thing in the next like two minutes so happier of course he's not so bad but

(Start: 00:01:02)
anyway here's the wheels they are Advent replicas they called real Lux racing I don't know they're 5x1 14.3 which is perfectly 7j so they're pretty small they will fit up to two to five about 45 70 and tires these have got 205 what are you far I think 2 or 540 17 it's good enough I'll probably just change the center caps at some studs that you need a little bit of cleanup and that's what I'm gonna do right now hopefully it's when I get to dog too quickly so what I'm gonna do now is open up the area where the car is it's also about to rain knowing my bad luck it looks already as soon as I pull a toy I got to do it in the carport you guys know what that means [Music]

Title: Making the black RX7 louder... Sort of
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQQJJaJXEl4

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys welcome to the vlog I'm along the way now to go pick up the black Oryx even let me make up an exhaust on the black Oryx even for the silver one so this is story last week I went to powerful exhausts they cut that big ugly back box off the black FD they threw my HKS part on unfortunately I didn't realize at the time that the mid pop wasn't done it wasn't a 3 inch prophecy v6 model exhausts to do some big ugly metal back box it's really small and restrictive and still on this I don't have time last week heading back now they're gonna cut the met Popoff put a nice free-flowing one night cap no silencer then once it's all done test it make sure it works pull the whole system off put the stock system from the silver FD on that car and then I'm going to take the modified one back home to the silver FD so the black if T's in the sty stock someone's gonna have really loud exhaust that's the game plan I'm on the

(Start: 00:01:02)
way now we had to fix the black aft so here's the exhaust that came off the silver FT this one's gonna be going on to the black FD nothing wrong with it it's just too quiet so I'm gonna work on my single server like I said earlier luckily I've got two FDS otherwise I would've had to put the silver car on a flatbed take it through the exhaust place make up the whole system and then drop it back so it's currently got 76 Melo 3 inch for the educates bucks all the way up to here ish and then the poplar goes from there to about here as the mud pop and it's a big stock Aggie box hello I'm showing you let go I can just show you over here so here today has changed and that's

(Start: 00:02:04)
three inch there - there is exactly that piece so that is what I need cut off on the black car [Music]

(Start: 00:03:17)
[Music] all right girls be done I'm back on the start alright guys we've done I'm back on the stock standard exhaust you know this means this car is 100% standard now power but I can't talk is a lot less classes you're wondering exhausted sitting right behind me broken up into exhaust made of our exhibit I still do to make the down pop-up I'm going to use that HPS twin turbo on Civic League small 3-inch I might be cutting that and then welding on to the event section they really have made up so this is probably going to be

(Start: 00:04:17)

Title: MR2 SW20 Exhaust Leak Fix
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSYO2rdd9QE

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the vlog so what I'm going to put to the test is the chrisfix way of resolving the exhaust leak on him or - okay he doesn't know Mustang but this is cooler so exactly let me show you guys what I'm dealing [Music] but ever listen to those horrendous exhaust noise [Music] [Music] we don't want to get too hot suck on a wick in the car research little for now that's what I'm working with [Music] as you can see

(Start: 00:01:01)
[Music] as you can see this little bit of reasonable space back again at all so that's my limit us as on solids in so first things first average the car sitting on jack stands a moment really changing the wheels they look awesome sorry for the wind noise if there is any rough because it is a dual exhaust system on a minute do is block off one side of these so I'm gonna do that time so the first thing I've done is I've blocked off for six awesome first week show that you can either use a rubber glove or a condom for the better content hidden there so rubber glove will be I don't have one of the common either so put some cling wrap and some duct tape looks like a manhole we're not going to use a lot of pressure because we're gonna use the backing peanut or the shop back one will

(Start: 00:02:01)
do is I'm a pretty short system for pushing it in I'm not gonna be running the vacuum which means on either switch what's trout family rub that sit up I'm just going to shut this room a Robin to the exhaust jack so the next thing we gotta do is we're gonna pressurize the system through this in using the blower on the Shelf back my hope here holds up for this watch that way [Music] see that weight working in all you can have to go back on those right so the next trick is we need some soapy water allowance is mag wheel cleaner but there is soap in the water inside here so I'm gonna spray this all over the exhaust from underneath and then I'll switch this blower on and hopefully we see some bubbles [Music]

(Start: 00:03:10)
I found the leak and I can't get it it's a it's a leaky catch so the cap is blown and nothing I can do open the cap back on and walk from do anything I need to take it to exhaustion how do I know this because I've been spraying bubbly water solution whenever they're all over the place put the whole pressurization thing underneath the car oh good open cab I've decided to put a heat shield off spray the top curves you can see a little weird thought and no bottles on my manifold at all but then you said there's a catalytic converter which is parallel to the ground there somewhere I've found anything about it it's blown I need you cut it off replace a straight pop and another cat I don't know damn it I thought I could taste the crucifix away by using some sort of like African JB world

(Start: 00:04:11)
Oh guess what all those did was a quick cleanup and in the vlog damn blows a bit of a PP video that so here's the theory behind all of this and he has done it put the shop vac in make sure it blows pressurize the exhaust system spray the soapy water all over the exhaust wait till the blood bubbles somewhere then you know where it is then you switch the shop vac on to the vacuum mode run it again and then get yourself in jb weld in my case i've got something called gun gun and place it all over the the leak on exhaust and then run the car for a little bit well my case more heat the better jb weld you got to leave it for like two hours until it's a bt solid and then you can run the car what a pity that's cause it's a cool little car and I'm putting some nice wheels enough I'm gonna hopefully drop drop the suspension may be quite levers or no it's pinching the springs I don't know yet

(Start: 00:05:11)
all I know is that I need to make this car a little bit more presentable and I'm working on it let's get it fixed I'm gonna take it out to exhaust shop next week sometime maybe I can just swap out a cap for me there guys thanks for watching it's the only next videos you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different then you must be kidding think you're gonna hate me but just don't get it it's impossible responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the codes you gotta take us though you can't be your proto with your time no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do what I can to use all these opinions that all these positions they come in and millions they Park in your vision but you can't listen that [ __ ] is on fixing cuz you want the power is why is your training

Title: RX7 FD3S AST Relocation and Plumbing
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RtBzaajUVU

(Start: 00:00:00)
I'm sure pretty much all of you figure this out already but I am an idiot I've messed up quite a few things on this rx-7 single server build one I'll drop the bolt into the engine oh my god drop in the engine that was one of my fondest moments luckily it dropped into the Sun side and I'm gonna be taking that out pretty soon too my radiator position is incorrect because I thought I was very clever and I looked at pictures and did minimal research I figured I could get away with a stock radiator which sits directly be like that and well that's not gonna work so the intercoolers in pretty much the right position sort of I'll get to that in a sec I have to be aware the stock radiator completely and the stock fans also going to be deleting the air-conditioning systems that please and I come out with a little bit of a clearance issue there I mean it's not touching but it's close and I don't want

(Start: 00:01:02)
it to be catastrophic in any way I have to wait for a new radiator and fan setup which is going to be a proper v-mount setup which means the insecure the studies and pretty much the same place the radiators gonna come in at like a 45 degree angle roughly and well yeah a couple of you guys called me out on it and I'm pretty much an idiot so that's the story I might be rectifying it by putting in a new radiator and fan what's the third thing that I gonna yes because I've never done this before and again because I didn't research my oil feed and my oil return or not dead center or 180 degrees which means there'll be a buildup of oil at the bottom Jason called me out on this yeah anyway so I've got to fix this up what a big deal have already started loosening all these bolts yeah I just need to get a little bit of a bit of tools I can take that guy out of so anyone the rest of this and then I can clock it and that should be it as you

(Start: 00:02:04)
can see I've been building brackets within secular is a bracket this one I need to cut and drill a hole so it's at the right position now sort of interferes in a move just slightly this starts rot this sad I'm not happy with because the famil is going to be stock position I had nowhere to put this fuse book so I left it in this wou stock position I'm going to be putting in the new radiator and fans under there which means the scan fool down a bit and get pitting in the front somewhere which means the intercooler can come back and this bracket now needs to change which means I'm not drilling the holes just yet that's why there's a bit of a length on this bracket that I'm building so that's the story so the intercooler is not going to be sitting at this funny weird angle like it is now it's gonna be sitting flush and yeah hopefully everything will be hunky-dory and sorted so what am i doing now well cleaning up this mess again a little bit and then I bought some hose I'm going to be

(Start: 00:03:04)
extending the ast and then also I need to run from there to underneath the uim I'm thinking of putting the AC then you know it is right now but I'm gonna put it over here so I'll make a bracket that will run a bolt on some way [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:04:57)
[Music] so I've told you guys three things that's wrong in this car there's probably a bunch of other things but I wouldn't say wrong but just done my way D our budget T whatever it's kind of working for me right now where my ast is sorted I've seen to make a bracket the

plumbing for the URM assorted you saw that now what else I've seen thrown the part of racing pulley I'm know it for Jonah and Gareth the guy's gonna come through Bain is going to be joining us as well so it'll be next Friday we're gonna finish up all you've got to do that's left now bear in mind I'm gonna be leaving the radiator in the stock position for now for the startup until I've got the new stuff so this is going to stay in the funny position until Everton you deliver until I put the new stuff now you saw that funny part that I got or they call this compensation pop it's full of tape well anyway it's not exactly what I want this is just to keep it in position so I did cut it in two different places and I change the shape of it I have another one it's not from the black if T I bought it from Japan from a company called from Japan and I'm going to be doing some plastic welding now they don't know the shape and how I want it I'm going to be cutting that gut up because I [ __ ] it

(Start: 00:07:01)
up slightly I'm gonna be cutting it up and I'm going to be doing plastic welding on it so soldering iron bonding the same type of material heating it up melting it joining it kind of just like welding okay so look because pretty much done I've got my battery terminals sorted out it's go time let's look at the board quickie foot upon operating pulley I'm going to deal with the guy's foot and so I'm not using it radiator I'm going to be running with one fan for now this car's not going to leave the garage until the new radiator female setup is here clean degrease the bay for radio pups I was actually done but we turn the radio that's all done next NASD agency make a break of food so the only thing I've got left to do is block the middle water pops I've done two of them already down the bottom here all right so the ghetto budget or exceeding big singles ever filled is almost done a little bit

Title: The real reason WHY I don't drive my R32 GT-R
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VtEZVy-8zM

(Start: 00:00:00)
what is up guys and welcome to the vlog I often get a lot of comments on YouTube and I get a lot of comments on Instagram guys are asking me why don't I drop off the GTR a lot actually why don't I Drive any of my JDM cause a lot well I'm gonna tell you guys right now so I'm pretty sure all of you know that this one is almost done with a single server so that's the reason why when I Drive that on GTRs kept behind here so is there more - okay so you guys wanna know the real truth - I don't drive off 32 GTR that's why these two crazy bastards okay I guess I'm being truly honest yeah that's one of the reasons a lot of traffic ease cause so often I haven't finished closing up the carport yet so

(Start: 00:01:00)
the plan is to kind of use those things that's a corrugated sheeting or roofing go all the way down to the bottom block up that section there by the shed and then block up over there so right now they've got the back garden which I don't have probably won't sway meters with a run around and play and have got access to these two cars which kind of sucks because it's a mission they're still puppies if I let them out the front they run out the gate [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:02:05)
so another thing that people have been asking me in the comments section is can I please do an updated walk around video on the r32 GTR and well this is what this video is it's a walk around video all right everyone this is a nonce 93 in essence Karla an r32 GTR I've almost caught for roughly about five years now I decided to bat the bullet in non - non non Mon Santi I've decided about the bullet in 2013 November ish and well picked it up the Japanese auctions and not going to disguise the process that I picked it up but as you can think 2013 it was a lot cheaper than order us now so I'm pretty stoked about that the car is actually silver underneath this is Plasti Dip I put it on just to be a little bit different I don't know I'm probably gonna pull it off at the end of the year let's see yeah I don't know yet anyway it's got a couple things and let's run through it okay I'm gonna do this quick

(Start: 00:03:08)
there's a little bit of a lightning storm about to happen so dogs please move out of the way let's go the rear of a car I've got buddy Club P ones for front and back buddy Club P ones they're 17 inch wheels wrapped with 2 4 545 17-inch tires these are federal five nine five RS tires they are semi slicks which is which is scary there's nothing wrong with these tires like great eyes it's just a little bit scary in the reign of Tom's whoa I remember the car is dirty it doesn't need a wash so hopefully the rain will sort that out I've got the N one spoiler on the back what else is done on the back Takemoto exhaust this is a three and a half inch exhaust all the way from down pops the down pops of twin 76 Muller custom made for a twin 3-inch

(Start: 00:04:09)
coming in two three and a half minute popping but my little matchstick on that side so what's regards to the bodywork I mean the cost pretty much stuck it's got that in one lip on the front tier and then the front bumpers been chopped up a little bit not not the nicest of cuts but it has been chopped up a little bit so the Big Brother markings but that is a greedy Trust intercooler original trust into cure this thing is massive now you guys don't see this in the video but I'm busy fasting of this dog with one hand because he's just all over me so I'm really not all over the car I'm happy all right let's take a look at the interior before we jump into the engine bay so what do we have here I've got a memo rice steering wheel I've got a boost gauge that's been fitted into the whatchamacallit a/c band thing so that looks that looks really cool and it's like an OEM top look I really love it I've changed the LEDs everywhere so they

(Start: 00:05:13)
are red see there that looks sick there's a video on my channel if you guys wanna know how I did that seats the stock seats actually a pretty good neck they didn t little bit of a clean ivory installed the rear seats they were out for some time for probably 10 months more every year maybe I with original nurse and Scott on mats in the car I'd be half of the original ones for the rear just haven't thrown them in only have a say belt five-point harness what's sitting on the driver's side it's kind of to be a little bit awkward none can really use it so often take passengers in this car so I figured I'll thread in the front here and it looks cool someone's gonna say something in the comment section about my gear now if you do buy me a new one I've got an apex II power of CEC you with the hand controller I also have the HKS EB c5 or

(Start: 00:06:14)
easy ed model boost controller with the display for it this is actually my second unit the other one broke you guys remember changing and like 20 videos ago that unit is sitting on an apex II holder so HKS the boss on a pixie holder whatever looks cool then over here I've got a Grady full auto timer it's actually tada and I didn't do that it came from Japan with that tammana but they've taught it into my speedo so I can pull up last last 9 speed and all that stuff I don't know this cost pretty neat I picked it up with 79 thousand kilometers it does have the infamous - bubble but it's really small and as you can see there compared to a lot of other people probably wondering what's on the floor there that's one of the HRD is one of the HR these popped and I having run around to changing it let's take a look at the boot the boot is super boring it's been stripped out I almost forgot to mention this car is sitting on slotted and cross

(Start: 00:07:18)
drilled Dusk's iniquity but it's got EBC pads enough calipers have been painted yellow I don't know I think it looks at right now the cost sitting on tain coilovers I think they were the tain super streets I may be wrong I don't actually remember it's also got a whole bunch of Nismo end links and there's no suspension in the back I don't have all the photos anymore but there's a whole bunch and there's my stuff in the back here maybe there's a photo popping up on the screen I'm sure I don't remember if I kept them well that's pretty much it for the interior and the exterior of the car now let's take a look at the engine bay throughout this is that it came with the RB 2620 turbo obviously it's a GTR I still have the soft popping on I haven't done hard popping for the turbos but whatever it is what it is it's got a HKS superpower fly-in text they came by the car but they're green I've changed those up there's element in popping in here because the other one was the caving a little bit and plus I want to change

(Start: 00:08:19)
everything to rid so I need to put a cash account at some stage and there's my solenoid for the HKS EBC five what else obviously relocated the battery to the back my fuse box thing breaks I kind of taped it up there's not much to say on the engine bay side but I'm in a stock heads the stock mmm what the interacts I've got exhaust like a down popov with that big gritty front mount I made 404 horsepower no I made 400 horsepower 303 kilowatts and one point I think it was just just one bar actually it's just one but at my decent power and the car looks cool and you know what I'm not aiming for big numbers with the setup I'm going to be stripping everything as soon as I'm finished with us and maybe do a little bit of work on the mr2 because just recently done a feature on an mr2 and it came out up slices that kind of look so much better than a month so I

(Start: 00:09:19)
think I might do some work on the MRT but I need to finish this guy almost done there's another video coming out check it out I'm right there one more front and out with the boys and the call be running and that's gonna be happening this coming Friday what else what that Grady twin brother nautical a [ __ ] hop so it'll basically be a big gritty t78 when HKS t4z turbo or a gritty t88 ever that'll be sitting here and it'll be a [ __ ] it'll get jewel MEF because I'm intending on keeping the stock EC not stock a pixie power if see I mean so there's a lot of stuff in the pipeline a lot of things that may be changing but this is it I've stripped out a lot of stuff an engine bay that wasn't really required yeah yeah I'm missing one bush it shuttle for nose drag racing I don't know why I don't have questions I need to get a new one I keep forgetting they will remember now when I'm editing well that's pretty much it for the build I

(Start: 00:10:20)
mean that's just the basic four hundred horsepower with a lot of stock pots and dog here so everyone that is my affinity GTR it's gonna get absolutely walloped by this thing when that's running but it'll redeem itself when it got big singles ever okay well thank you so much for watching that's been my little walk around video on the r32 GTR sorry for the click buddy title but thought I have a laugh with the dogs it is a true story that's why I drove these damn cars until I finish up there and was everything take you so long because I'm lacking workers they they went on holiday an extra long holiday which is in like two months now so I've got no weekend workers to come help me with construction and finishing off the house whatever they come back next week so finish the carport put a ceiling in the garage finally and then get carried on race to the house but that's it for the video thank you so

Title: My R32 GT-R is going single turbo

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the blog I have some exciting news as you can tell by the title and the thumbnail I've decided that once I've finished this bloody single turbo or exhibiting and sitting in the garage I am going to be doing a single turbo conversion on r32 GTR nice so this my friends is a single turbo to twin math doohickey thing it's made by Grady this is an original one by Grady I did pick it up second hand but it is obviously a piece of metal it's an awesome condition I think it came up to map sixes unfortunately they're not cos it 32 map sensors there are RB 26 map sensors but whatever I'll have some spares and to be honest I'll probably get sims in 32 now why am I going this route quite simple I want to do like a I don't want to say the way budget but more like a a period-correct build I

(Start: 00:01:03)
don't know has that right I'm lost for words yeah okay but just let hear me out yeah this is what I want to do and before you guys come on over there why don't you do that I've already gotten a pixie piracy and as the DJO version which means I have to use maps and I'm not gonna go and toss my perfectly good working you see you if you so badly wanted me to hit it you see you a better issue and make a better r32 GTR link this video and also to your platforms give me a like hit the subscribe button if you really subscribe thank you so much I need that YouTube money the YouTube money helps with the bar stuff cool stuff and like I said if you want me to get a cool big server new ECU just link and lock and share and do whatever you need to do to make this channel blow up a little bit more than

(Start: 00:02:03)
other ideas too subscribers are there what the my little rent back to what I was thinking period correct budget II build a group there pixie piracy in the car as a DJ trife's good map so I'm gonna get his entity to maps I'm gonna then go for a grade et 78 or t88 Toba I haven't looked at what it would do with a stock RB 26 on I look at Ta yet I might cams might need a lot of the other stuff but anyway I've got with the HSE BC 5 in the car which is the older version of the color screen one-stop the touch screen so it's sort of paired correct there's a lot of stuff that I can do that's period-correct I don't I keep using that with but you guys let me know in the comment section is this still a lot of builds out there if you look on Instagram it whatever tag like North 82 GTR Scholar North easy you'll find a lot of cars that do you have thus set up so

(Start: 00:03:06)
it's not such a bad thing I'm not aiming for huge numbers yeah I'm just aiming for more drivability a little bit more noise than what I currently have now some bit uh noise you guys although how cool and r32 sounds like or any arbitrary sex winners opened up and you're in a single server probably should have done this a while ago so I'm gonna buy good manifolds I'm gonna get a decent server but an old-school top step turbo obviously fuel system needs to be redone there's a lot of stuff that needs to be redone but this is a start it is gonna happen I just need to finish this silly rx-7 get it on the road plans are today is the 22nd 21st of January on the cheapest I don't know whatever date next week Friday not the FATA coming the following Friday the guys are coming over and we're gonna finish this build we're gonna do it on one not because there's not much left to do I am heading off to fabricators on Thursday and they're gonna fabricate I need a market right now actually before

(Start: 00:04:08)
if again right that's it that's what I'm marking that's gonna sit over there and it's gonna look super cool and then I got brackets that I just need I'm out and then I need relocate the ast somewhere down there it'll pop where I got everything it needs to be done and then just making you pop so this is costing a bracket so it's not alone here there's and your pops and you cut them and throw them on and then I've got a running car I needed to do my belts and small other stuff which is what the girls are gonna help me with but you get the idea how about the cause of me running scene and then I can get out of the garage and bring the r32 back into the garage because it's currently sitting in the carport with the mr2 getting nice and dusty it's kind of like an enclosed carport but yeah it's looking dusty that is pretty much it for this vlog at least you guys know what I'm doing and if you

(Start: 00:05:09)
got some advice if you want to tell me anything you will tell me I'm an idiot for doing this no problem just let me know in the comment section below house and girls thank you so much lots of exciting stuff happening very soon I'll have a really cool event that I'm organizing and that's gonna be shown on the channel pretty soon then I've got a feature car my first in the future car which is coming up in about two weeks Tom the video should be up in about two weeks Tom and then there's something else which is exciting but I've forgotten about cousin girls that's it for the video thank you so much for watching I'll see on the next one just peace you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different and you must be kidding think you're gonna hate me but just don't get it it's impossible problem dear responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the codes you gotta take us though you can't be a prototype no more you to tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you

(Start: 00:06:11)
disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it to you for these opinions that all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen that [ __ ] is on fixing cuz you want the power is why is your training

Title: Doing RX7 FD3S things in the garage..
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OInAv23sy9I

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys and welcome to the vlog I'm back in the garage I'm not doing anything special whatsoever I'm just gonna be talking a little bit of crap playing of the what causes or x7f t3 is and I'm gonna be cleaning up the garret because the garage is filthy so it was actually a bit well a lot worse than what it was is right now I just need to put all the tools back and a little stuff back it really really really sucks having a single garage and you know the issue that I have now is I'm busy working on the car I don't know much Tom especially on those Friday nights with the guys we working out too like you live in 12:00 and not and we just picking up tools using them throwing them on the table and then eventually this entire table is just completely full of tools so I'm heating up from all that mess but what am i doing today I want to try and make another one of these pops not try I have to make no one pops so I've got this guy here and by the way how cool is that

(Start: 00:01:00)
in Takuto setup look it's gonna look something like that I've done a test for the ready the bonnet closes everything's fun see those piece over here that's what I used to look like before so I'm going to try and cut that exact piece obviously a little bit smaller it'll probably end up being about there somewhere and then have a short piece of element in there right I'm back I just had my old man comes through and he was helping me out with making some brackets for the intercooler well I'm making them run now but he's been measuring so I'm gonna make a bracket that goes from there it's gonna come out slightly and it's gonna go into this so this is the exact heart that it's gonna be at the exact angle it's not exactly the best angle because of this little fuse box I don't want to relocate that I don't want to cut the wires and rejoin them so I'm gonna have a slight angle this looks so bad there's a boom I'm back it's not tommnow kind of it's like 6:30 p.m. daughter's going to sleep so I can kind of miss her on the

(Start: 00:02:00)
garage for a little while things a little bit cleaner than what they were not much but like after I stopped filming earlier my daughter woke up I had the baby Martha yeah flip to that so I'm gonna cut that up now let's see what I can do I also want to shorten this just do that now right so I'm probably gonna take that much off so what's the easiest way to cut this I actually have no idea but I've figured something out what I'll do is I'll drop this piece of aluminum inside so it's the same size about three inch might give it just before it lands on it

(Start: 00:03:04)
it's roughly there make sure that it's completely straight looks about right and then look at the super sharp blade you see that

(Start: 00:04:06)
so anyway that's the way I cut a silicon pop probably not the right way but it's the way that on earth and they were something I've tried the other day where well wasn't less enough but I took a craft knife and I heated it up so it was pretty much glowing red and not slashed through but it kind of lost his touch the coffee way and cocked it up where my heart is good I'll take a look at my heart which is this one Tracy okay you guys can already see on the camera but it's pretty much on point so I'm going to leave the heart like that so I'm actually gonna take quite a lot of meat off I could probably just line it up with that one and then cut it but I think I think I'll cut small increments and measure and go from there okay so I could probably the

(Start: 00:05:49)
holy crap it's so hot in here I am sweating like a [ __ ] so cut the pop that's what I cut it off of that path quite a bit had to keep marking and cutting marking telling me about 15 minutes and I go to this point here so you can see it's kind of gone all the way this one doesn't but I want to redo this one at some stage but anyway they still like I mean there's they another pop so it's still holding quite nicely but I'll redo this one before the car actually gets in the right property for some decent tuning as you can see it's not exactly the right heart this one is still a bit higher than there now there's reason to my madness yeah but I want to cut it all the way because I need to get these brackets first so there's a bracket is going to be coming from here to here and that brackets actually no prop this up a little bit see it's not fully lined up there now that is but now I'm lifting so I need a weight that broke and once I looked you can see that kind of starts

(Start: 00:06:50)
lining up a little bit more I do need to cut it over here where the cameras looking cut a little bit more this I can get a decent run of aluminium pop in there but you get the idea I'm not cutting it fully until I get this bracket or shut up the bracket a Monday Tuesday and then then it'll be propped up away from everything um you probably wondering why a bunch of towels and rags it's just to prop up the intercooler so my oil drain is coming on the side it's actually the complete opposite see it over there see that so there's more oil feed it should be 180 it should be in the center I need a clock the turbo again jonno if you're watching this gareth if you watch Alice I'm sorry we may have to pull it to about I don't know yet but there's some bolts up here which are pretty easy to get to this six I can get to like four of them okay the other two probably underneath the car but if we loosen those we can clock this section here a little bit more that way Bock [ __ ] I might have to get a new

(Start: 00:07:53)
oil drain pop made up I don't know I really hope but it's not a big deal hopefully we can do it without putting the whole manifold off because well that's the story of the car it's looking a lot better almost finish the intercooler side car looking great I still a their bathroom lugs on Monday I need a leg foot here just to ground the car and then that put the throttle cable back on put the belts on whatever's left on this list you got to pause the video take a look and then I'm done and try not to think about it but just let me get the bolt out both that fell into the engine yeah that ball I'll do it but that can be the last thing just before we start the car All Right girls bit of a strange video turned out to be a how to cut your silicon pop video thank you so much for watching see y'all next video Cheers

(Start: 00:08:56)
you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different and you must be kin think you're gonna anyway just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the domes you gotta take as though you can't be your prototype no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it too you saw these opinions and all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen they're cities on fish because you want the power is why is your trainer

Title: JDM Auctions - Mazda RX7 FD for sale in Japan

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up everyone and welcome to another video today is gonna be a little bit of a different one and that's because we're gonna be looking at Japanese car auctions now this is one of my all-time favorite things to do not just working on cars buying cars driving them one of my favorite things to do is to jump up to the auctions see how much cars are going for look at what they've got what's been done to them and well just enjoy some JDM vibes so what we're gonna do today is look at master auric savings that were for sale at the japanese auctions are basically these are all past auctions meaning these cars are sold and it shows that price that these cause so forth if you guys want to see what's current and what's for sale for example if I have to do a video on Monday I could show you guys what's available for that week Monday to Friday but unfortunately what I have process I can just talk about the cause you guys let me know in the comment section what you want to see but for this particular video let's look at cars that have been sold so the way uppsala will be using is japan partner these guys are great I've actually use them for my previous purchases awesome JDM cars I've randomly opened up a couple I have seen one or

(Start: 00:01:01)
two of them because I do look at this stuff daily but for the most part I think I've opened up about eight tabs I haven't seen five or six of them so this one I haven't seen this is an ounce 97 type R is so you can see yeah here's the mileage 186 kilometers an hour rating so an R rating means that it's been rebuilt so not just a rebuild so for example it could be a crash car that had a panel repaired or resprayed but it could also mean our for modifications now I'm pretty certain of this one is our because it's modified if you take a look it's got a random wing on the back I don't know what make that is and it looks quite a bit of stuff is actually done to this car so let's take a look at the first picture some decent wheels I must say I'm not very good with the wheels I can tell you that these are Artie that he said well I could if I saw t37 but I don't know what these are exactly couldn't you speck bump on up these came with the 102 models I think actually 19 on on words correct me if

(Start: 00:02:04)
I'm wrong off the mark upon it pretty cool off the market fender or sod skirts aftermarket bumper pretty cool car she wonder what makes this is in this wing it looks like it could be a charge speed I don't have charge speed actually make for the rx Evans anyway next one I got your soul for three thousand five hundred and ninety years dollars and one hundred and five thousand kilometers in a month 96 and it's an RB I'll be honest yeah RB I'm not too familiar with an IRA means that it got repaired quite well it's tears ABI which means is really good and in tears the C which means is average so it might be a slot where on the steering wheel or seat it's got like a whole map fob going on here with it's pretty shitty rating you know what I don't like about these Japanese auctions is all the photographs of low quality so you can zoom and let me stress the batch I can see if there's some road rash on

(Start: 00:03:04)
this look I mean how do you tell that's the thing it's a gamble that's why I like it it's gotten off the market exhaust but it's a pretty crappy one to be honest with the exhaust being the tiny little one in the center and outer some little fake sheathing thing they're not a bad bar for three and a half thousand dollars it is a fully automatic Oh while my safely about a minute it is and if far so it's a 5-speed now let's take a look here if he goes no no no how the auction sheets work they pretty much tell you on the side so and a1 is a small scratch a to use a scratch a3 is a big scratch so this cars got a two on the one wheel and one of the other wheel on the door it's got a small scratch b2 is the small defect in bumper or about the saucy a thumb so there's a defect on the door somewhere so three and a half thousand dollars there is a pretty damn good process especially for the mileage is how - man 26 model there was a refresh not to known she's saving that's what opted to get both the black and silver except and that I have my

(Start: 00:04:05)
position as non sponsor seven and above because the rats nest was simplified the turbos were upgraded these you're slightly different bigger brakes no just a type RS at bigger break anyway they were mauled upgrades and no you can google them I don't remember them all fan but I did when I was buying these cars but I won't have the picture let's take a look at this guy right big cross on here which means there is no inspection now I can't read Japanese or kanji it's a manual it's not to 95 got a hundred and three thousand kilometers it sold for two thousand five hundred and five US dollars I'm assuming it's it could be a runner I don't know how to tell but just take a look at the pictures now looking at it I don't know so much that probably night angel in here if you can look at this broad hot that is crazy hot I mean my so the FT has got lowered suspension we stock low suspension because a Type R is

(Start: 00:05:06)
but the black ones attorney X was stock suspension there's not that high I have a feeling there's no engine and it probably says that here but whatever it looks like it's sitting but it may look at the door missing a door card I'm seeing radio this trim looks like has been pulled out a little bit see fob possibly clips broken this looks like she's open seats look like a good to see there's a broad seat in it look see what's in the back seat yeah looks like some sort of a seatbelt I wallet no no no you're a cool thing about my top rs when it arrived and had all the service books all the history the manual everything and the black one didn't come with it so quite thankful to whoever sold for someone that is a wiring mess of night I see vacuum hoses which means yeah look it came from there

(Start: 00:06:08)
is a vacuum or boost gauge aftermarket steering wheel the horns been pulled out for bad for this car I love these broad seats but I'm gonna talk about it all right when I get this car I don't know if it had an engineer was running to an or thousand dollars okay alright here's another one this is the type core to you not too familiar on over the top ours you know so for 4,000 years dollars eighty four thousand kilometers 1984 model again no inspection sees driver okay well good for the driver I'm assuming a buzz drive rear bumper has been replaced it's been in a bit of a mmm just a little knock on a pavement or something out and I off the market bumper it's got some we had fenders geez actually I've seen this car I've had a

(Start: 00:07:09)
look good come with some free spa care gloves that's got at a pixie power of C which is pretty much the only good thing it does have a hand controllers hidden up here looks like to defi gauges modified shift not missing all the trim Mia which is hard to get hold of especially for a JD and model handbrake has been pulled up all the way hidin was supposed to go and it's gone a little drift knobs this looks like a my race wheels missing horn in it and there's a boost gauge plugged looks like there's some gauges here - mmm bit of a shambles this one I don't know I'd love to know what actually happens to this car but anyway it is sold and there is nothing we can do about it honey for probably into the America - not the America - America so if you're watching us and you know who bought this car let me know interesting next it's one of us this is smart man it's type RBS as a

(Start: 00:08:12)
Baathist edition I think is an RP oh I am his telling to say that is because it doesn't have the writ in terror it's also fully automatic and it's awful a lot of money 2001 model 10,000 u.s. dollars Sydney 2000 kids look I know you guys that are watching this can say oh well that's not a lot of money when we paying twenty five thousand US dollars twenty five twenty thousand US dollars for an rx-7 well if you sit on these auctions long enough he'll actually see how cheap these cars actually go for baron 1 my black FD honey two thousand dollars plus shipping plus so i worked out a little bit more but he's cause are cheap but they're getting more expensive because of you dudes in america buying these cars so this one's pretty boring we're gonna go ahead so just the 3e sees that's not the greatest it's an automatic and of course stock exhaust can see it's got a stock exhaust uh boring not getting into I'll swing now I

(Start: 00:09:15)
like the wing don't like that thing so this is like my type RS it's got a little extra spare thingy on the side anyway I'm not getting into this one what's left go to the final car and this one's a Kay limited type RT I have Nadia it could be a type our thinking probably as a type I sixty six thousand kilometers in hun tiny formal no inspection don't know if it's running straight off the bat I can see his Road Rash looks like fire damage on the front mmm flat tire comparably isn't moving a little while it's missing the petrol kept thing and sucks in Tara oh you know what pretty sure isn't that might send this one is the you I am sitting on the floor now steering well I wish I had that stereo I think your steering wheel from our except I got that big bulky one it sucks okay I'm pretty sure let's say look at the rod hard look at that you'd

(Start: 00:10:18)
see how hard this is this is almost as hot oh look at that the ers in the back this is pretty high almost as high as that other one that we saw so we can just say fliest you know the other one didn't have an engine either what a pity it's a lot of money for a car than that engine I think for once you man went to America must have go to America okay so that's it for the Japanese auctions that's what's sold in the past let's take a quick quick quick look and what is coming up and then you guys let me know in the comments section it's eally so you guys let me know in the comments section if you want me to take a look at cause that haven't been sold yet and our upcoming an auction there's a couple websites that really do that and one of them very good one it actually sells the cause is Pacific Coast water Gaza great Derek I believe we hope this one coming up this is a five grade a oh geez it's a spirit or top i early crap I

(Start: 00:11:23)
actually don't think I've seen one of these for sale I think I've seen one of these for sale on a Japanese culture this is insane take a quick look at this car so the spirt are was like the creme de la creme of the rx-7 if DS she just look at that interior insane so this guy's up for auction by the thomas videos up this card have been sold at the auctions already so I don't know man I reckon I'm gonna thumb sucky and I'm going to say eighty-four thousand US dollars okay I'm like I haven't bother looking out the car so spirit all its enough on Spurlock if you guys want to see any more videos of me doing this sort of stuff on the JD emotions let me know let me know in the comments sections what type of car you would like to see and I will do it for you thank you so much for watching I will see you on the next video yes

my issues turbo is a hundred percent bolted on that okay anyway oh my lawns are done a little bit of a kink on that one but it's just gonna be drainage so not a big deal will feed on the top it's going are those little swivel things on that that worked on quite nasty pineapple Racing pulley on the side haven't really finished the install I just need to put the rest of this water pump needs to be topped in and then I need to put the belts on and then we're done with that gonna obviously put the rest of the belts on the car and I need to put the new radiator fans in Gareth another bus looks super cool gold reflector for I don't know what difference it will make I have seen a couple YouTube videos where it's like a couple degrees but I don't know what difference will make there but it does look who it is battery location is done take it to the back of the car you can take a look at that well sorry it's not exactly done because I need something here to hold

(Start: 00:03:03)
the battery so there's this little plastic battery holder thing that I kind of need to bolt into the fourth or x7 but anyway the cables are done I've had those krumpers all end I was thinking about putting in those pivot raisin battery voltages on your on and I'm maybe not I'll just leave it like that have a superkey look okay so let's call that down because the other part is pretty quick I do need to put a leg on this so this is my ground it needs to be a leg an end to go there let's just need to be mounted off to the fans and put back on what else i HT needs to be relocated thinking about bleaching it but I'm not just running from now all right nice big one Gareth and I worked two Fridays ago and we managed to do the wiring for the BBC so

(Start: 00:04:03)
that's the Beast control now the solenoid for the boost controller put all the wiring yeah that just needs to be closed up if you want to run your wiring into the cabin from the engine bay what are you going to do is you're going to follow that or halt over there push your wiring through it'll come through underneath that's black thing on either just put a little tabs but common security there's a grommet right over there normal to build this big what do you want to do is you want a coat hanger so coat hanger straight it's not straight anymore Todd wise or labor wise the bees can try that I mean I've managed to push the link it's thick it is as that rough you typed it up full what was the security seven break push the three ago I'm sitting on inside and he saw it pull it with of all scripts and yeah come out the other side okay so if we control those in the wide

(Start: 00:05:04)
band wiring is in a pixie power of C is and Java Tamas and I kinda just need a close up here and do the 12-volt wiring and all that stuff but you see I'm sort of done with all the wiring let me show you guys what it looks like with the intercooler okay it's gonna look something like that obviously the brackets are not in not holding in tequila and it's a little bit higher up and slightly less at an angle those pop-up II here is gonna have the blow fell the dump valve rolled it on to that down here when you take it off the fabricator since on next week that's gonna suck something like that or maybe I'm in Sodom not hers in short I want kid anyway you get the idea it's gonna be something like that but then tequila that Papa still need make up some wherever they privy that one I'm gonna bend it and yeah a little silicon pieces

(Start: 00:06:10)
that one but I'm gonna run on that side and then put the pop across it's gonna be a little short run that's gonna sit over there awesome cool matches the rest of the gold sort off okay so what the hell is left to do not that much one I need to get new hose so I'll do at the same time that I go get the fabrication gun to run from there to just anything you am it's not a big deal this one's for the Blofeld this the vacuum is going to come somewhere over there there's another water supply bottom that I need to block off have something quick to do then I've written erase the stuff put pineapple racing so like I said I've seen cotton that up and put the belt on halfway there that one run vacuum hose waste gets done map stance is done charcoal canisters done intake wore it in tightly cool pressure regulators done I think I'm in dumper reto Cadbury

(Start: 00:07:12)
almost done the recently I think once it's running I'm just gonna take it out and do a high pressure and all that I couldn't that with everything apart good radiator pops I do have one more idea to pop it on a change to purple one up there Mike it's gonna pop I just told you about it and then I need to make brackets and put the other fans extend AST as you can see there is not much difficulty because that's another thing I'm gonna drop this car with this SN exhaust so that's a V band section which sits in the back here I'm gonna drive with no bonnet get it down a couple kilometers down the road tuning is all shop get them to make an exhaust up but okay not just in car so guys that's pretty much it the car I'm so close and starting it I know it's taking such a long time but there's been so much going on am I in with the house and renovations I know I keep complaining about innovations but it's an ongoing

(Start: 00:08:12)
thing and problem ISM cannot doing it myself so I'll get a team of guys here I'm managing them I'm working with them on picking up the shovel and I'm shoveling stuff with him so the player is almost done which is cool so just he start building jungle gems and all sort of stuff for my daughter fake houses and anyway stuff that you guys do you don't want to hear back to the car stuff I've got a lot going on cousin deals I am rambling this has been a long video thank you so much for tuning him if you stayed all the way to the video thank you so much really appreciate don't forget to hit that like button and oh I'll see you on the next video just you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different and you must be kidding think you're gonna hate me but just don't get it it's impossible problem irresponsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the codes you gotta take as though you can't be a prototype no more you tell me what to do I don't give

(Start: 00:09:14)
a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it to you for these opinions that all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your vision but you can't listen that is all fiction cuz you want the power is why use your training

Title: I dropped a bolt into my RX7 FD3S engine...

(Start: 00:00:00)
oh my god he's dropping the engine that's what the bills are oh my tester come on so we're trying to fish it out if it goes on the passenger side on the right-hand drive it will fall into the sump if it falls on the left-hand side it goes into you into the rotors so big [ __ ] up I got my finger stuck in in that passage where I was trying to see how I did the opening isn't my finger of stuck out to rip it out I was at a point where the guys were about to pour oil over my

(Start: 00:01:01)
finger and I mean I was just calling for the fire department I was at a point where I just wanted if I can cut the car up and cut the engine bay hoping to get my finger out it was so scary here I pulled my finger I don't know a whole lot of meat came out my 58 stitches we'll see you later damn yeah so the bolts still stuck in the engine may the good news is it then fall to the right-hand side which is the rotary end or the rotor it felts a left-hand side which is the oil sump the bad news is there's a baffle plate on there and it's landed on the baffle plate we were trying on Friday night for quite a bit of time and managed to get the ball almost the top actually didn't know it was on the magnet at the time and I figured ah we're never gonna get it as I pulled it up the bolts show it I freaked out and I fell back down problem is it's fallen in slot II and it's landed on the baffle so the sunday rotten house two

(Start: 00:02:03)
days later Gareth is on his way now and we're gonna push the car off the driveway try and get some speed and I'm gonna slam the brakes as soon as I get down there somewhere hopefully that'll kind of jolt the bolt when the bolt will fall back into the sump and then I've made a tool which is a lot better than what we had with the tape on a coat hanger and it seems to be working I mean I'm hitting the bottom of the sump it's just 100% no bolt at the bottom of the sump and sitting on the bathroom so there's a bunch of wire holding two different magnets one from a nametag the Y's actually coming a little bit undone I'm you sorted out quickly but a lot better than what it was I made a little bit of a mess up and

(Start: 00:03:05)
excuse the floral [ __ ] I'm actually on the way to a year-end function for work so first of all what actually happened so I was working on this side of the car on the passenger side on the JDM and I was sorting out the oil filler neck and I'll try to figure out which bolts with rod ones because I didn't actually put them in order so I was trying to figure out which of the right ones and I was screaming the men and I don't know distracted tired whatever I don't want excuse I can give but anyway luckily added it and nobody else I dropped the ball through now there's two sides to this already see on cam but on the driver's side the DEP sod there is some sort of a plate and if it falls that side falls into the right tree end and luckily it didn't film the left hand side which falls into the sump however it's now caught between the

(Start: 00:04:05)
baffle and the side of the sump which is a major issue so I've been using this flexible rod over here with a magnet on the end and I've been doing a lot of fishing rod coat hangers with magnets try bent coat hangers tried setting up a last you on a on a fishing line connected to the endoscopic camera that I landed up buying which is something here this one so [Music] you well then I say if it's in the sump which is currently not it's above them they say leave it because unless you roll the car or go upside down yeah

(Start: 00:05:05)
you'll have more problems to worry about but yeah you're not gonna it's that baffle when we look out there that was please do that that looks like with some thread holding [Music] yeah what the [ __ ] no one heard he sure doesn't [ __ ] know that's tornado cameras at six LED lights on it really brought and that currents button guarding me where the bot is but the problem is quite tight down there so I can't get the camera and anything else in there without moving the position on

(Start: 00:06:06)
the camera I'm not seeing where I'm going so it is it is rather difficult rudderless flexible things of the claws it's stuck in such a position that it's not just straight down you get down and then to the right so for example if I drop it straight down every would land it up in the sump and well I'll just go straight down it's fallen it knocked somewhere and it's fallen down there but between the baffle of the sump and the Sun but by the way what do you guys think of the goal here I mean looks pretty cool not finished it needs to come up to about there and little bit further down and then around the back a little bit but anyway that's gonna look so cool Li aim is gonna get gold as well there's my V mountain tequila that looks so cool and I sit up in the front yeah I still need to do all my plumbing for radiator I've got my fans coming back this week sometime I've wet the girls coming over and we're gonna carry out

(Start: 00:07:06)
working on the car as if the bolt never felt in so what does it mean we're gonna put the uim back on we're gonna fasten up we're gonna put the oil filler neck back on we near the turbulence connected up you're gonna finish the gold we're gonna get the V Mountain tequila on and then I've got excuse the mess it's been crazy with this damn bolt stuck in yes I throw everything everywhere I've got my 50 ml to 70 ml reducer foam that's gonna go on servers I need to cut to dock here and it's gonna come across and then connect to the B mouth and then I've got my aluminum pop work for intercooler popping really and actually there's quite a bit of stuff up here Tony a soda then 150ml dump fell kind of matches the theme of everything else yeah 86 subject wideband I'll slowly slip it out this little car I'm seeing it push

(Start: 00:08:09)
the wiring through which I'm gonna do on the last Friday and the both color HK CBC needs to get in and find a pricing for these inside their factory like how she needs to happen so there's not a lot of stuff that needs to go down it's just this damn vault kind of threw us off anyway that's the story of the vault I've probably fished personally 17 plus hours with the flexible rod with the clamps a little catchy thing it's like it like I've had a Mike from work he's empty fishing like real fishing he was keen on trying and he pushed for hours and probably about three hours himself get everything mounted on and then next week from sought to saw it from over there to over there I'm gonna be raw bolting a massive rod I don't know what tensile steel and and what

(Start: 00:09:09)
sauce just yet but I've got an engine hoist and I'm gonna be hooked up on today a car is gonna get pushed all the way back and I'm gonna be lifting the engine so I can get to the sump and obviously pull the sample drop the subframe pull the sample get the damn bolt out and there's actually a small little magnet that got stuck in there as well but I mean whatever get it all out and then carry on anyways thank you so much for joining me I see you all in the next video Cheers you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same self you really think you're different and you must be kin think you're gonna anyway just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta stop the tones you gotta take as though you can't be your prototype no more you tell me what to do I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove I'm gonna make my move I'm gonna make it soon and I'll do it too you saw these opinions and all these positions they come in and millions they talk in your

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the vlog tonight is gonna be a very special night we are hoping to get a [ __ ] ton done on the car and maybe maybe just started if we lucky right first things first we're gonna pull the turbo off because I currently have an issue where there's a bit of a kink on the oil line right over there so we're gonna sort it up and just change the bin I hadn't had time this week to go get that [ __ ] sorted out but we are gonna fix it now then I've got a bunch of black in flight school everywhere URM all over the show blocking stuff on the L AM and we're gonna start putting that now and I've got a whole list of stuff through here we're doing whenever be running vacuum hers you and you're putting the turbo put the pineapple racing pulley and maybe maybe maybe we'll start the car but I need the twin-turbo system works

(Start: 00:01:42)
beautifully on the draw Beckham is what Maddox is an array of up to six and a half thousand rpm whereas this one goes up to eight and hard to produce okay guys we got all the blanking plates on mostly one of them at the back here where the heater pup was unfortunately my climate of the fault hall is a little bit too small doesn't hang on they shouldn't laser-cutting us they actually gave me the plate without drilling holes into them so let's get the holes drilled off to us anyway all other blanket plates are on which means we're gonna clean up here now I'm gonna put the uim back on and then we're gonna

(Start: 00:02:44)
start doing vacuum hoses and then buffing up everything else once the uim is on are we gonna be able to get to the water polo gear - Chandra sir x4 will all those things check with where you want to go on we only can it's over yeah but how are we gonna dance rats so I wanna run through yeah yeah we go Texas right yeah that's fun I'll run it over the coracoid Packer then through its slightly longer so I gotta do a bit of a year we could this thing yeah we could use them the top yeah so the chocolate comes there will be changes you could methan that one maybe not Rick oh yeah they crapped bad okay this sort of stuff for us to take this out again how much links do you think when you don't map another one for

(Start: 00:03:45)
the DVR let's just wake it up now with a UI Emily we're gonna put off there's a blank reason to pause you know yeah okay yeah that's fine cuz it makes a progress yeah you IM is sort of on we need a bolt it down still Garrett's busy doing the gold foil that's right look really cool everything is coming together there are a couple plugs that we weren't like sure about but obviously I deleted a lot of solenoids and there's many plugs galore so we pushing them back we're gonna tuck and well we makingtreks don't talk not yet and then we might have to put this wheel Lunik on the first yep I'm first I can't get to the one bolt hole if we don't put it on first sorry have you seen that there we go on the table the number 10 that funny

(Start: 00:04:45)
spinning on whatever you know yeah that one football the socket doesn't turn alright so I must just lift this absolutely room yeah but first I need upon identical screws of this oh my god what happened he's dropping the engine that's what the builds are oh that's my toes - come on

Title: These are ALL of my project cars!

(Start: 00:00:00)
hello everybody and welcome to another video this one's going to be slightly different I'm trying out a couple new things on the channel and what we are talk about today is what am I doing with all of my project cause I've had a number of you guys talk to me on Instagram and on YouTube asking me what am I doing with r32 GTR what am i doing at the mr2 and well let's start from the beginning so there's tackle the biggest project that's going on right now and that is the silver or except in 83 is I'm pretty sure everybody here has been following the build started about three and a half to four months ago where I got completely fit up with the twin-turbo setup the sequential setup wasn't waiting so well and I was sawed a dozen I figure it out and try and investigate what the issue was I knew it was something to do with a solenoid or perhaps the vacuum you on something well obviously somebody not working and I started digging around and notice I

(Start: 00:01:01)
wasn't installed down pop at the same time for the 22s you know so I'm pretty sure that a lot of you guys have been watching this single server but if you haven't been watching I'm going to tell you very quickly so about three and a half four months ago I decided it was a good idea to rip out the entire twin-turbo setup the reason why I did that is my sequential setup wasn't working and well I figured let me just modernize it and get a single server and they get attuned and blah get it running which is the way to go I mean pretty much everybody in the FT scene does this and well I started doing that and tom is just an issue for me which yeah that's always been an issue but I've had a few mates come around and my mates have been helping me if you check out the last three videos they've been really astounding you know that saying many hands make light work all that is so true so we at the stage where the teardown was completely done because we need to be decreased and cleaned up and I did a lot of that by myself over the

(Start: 00:02:02)
last two weeks or so so it's relatively keen but I want to get everything bolted on so I operationalize that I Honda right now because there's openings everywhere yeah anyway so peanut needs to carry on I've got the oil lance for the turbo that's currently on the car right now I did fit another test for the gain of the server and the will Lance I've asked a machining company to make me blanking plates for things like the ISC the idle speed controller and a number of other solenoids that are no longer need on the FD so in the next few days I've got the guards coming around and we are basically I'm just going to tackle a long list that I have and one of them is obviously foot all the blanking plates get the UI and back on the car get the oil lines tightened up which means get the turbo fully bolted on so well permanently until it blows up onto the manifold manifold must be taught and and bought on the block then we need to figure out how to push the wideband cables and the boost controller cables

(Start: 00:03:04)
through the firewall which I've actually figured out already but I'll show you guys in the video so there's a hole on the left hand side driver-side on the rotten draft card that we're gonna push it through it's gonna come out underneath the fender we're going to pull the fan little awning out push it straight into the cabin or it's gonna pop up somewhere behind the fuse box there obviously you guys will see that all in a new video then the stock exhaust is kind of just like hanging at the back it's just got rubber mounts on that needs to come out I've got a pineapple racing pulley which has arrived funny enough the part up racing pulley was yeah all alone at the time gonna film the previous video to be fitting parts and I was complaining that it hadn't arrived yet it was sitting in my post box so we're gonna be putting that I've got some gold foil some reflective foil and you guys are probably wondering why the hell are you putting gold foil in the car well I think it'll look pretty cool I don't know if you guys know Aaron Parker but he's yeah he's at a crazy if the I'm sure you saw it on hoonigan Channel well he's got cold

(Start: 00:04:05)
- just let me be with the gold I think it's gonna look cool I'm gonna do it down the strut side so the turbos would be sitting here and then there's like my strut tower over there I don't know it's like gonna reflect heat and whatnot so it's going there it's gonna look cool also the Alim if there's enough I'm gonna throw it onto the Alim stop fuel system for now and then I'm gonna go and get a fuel pump and buncha other but but I'm still going around the stock injectors for another eight fifties in the 550 CCS and obviously we're gonna put everything back as soon as we get working on the car which is gonna be in the next few days the conventional intercooler needs to be installed but it's not here yet and then there's pop work for the insecure that needs to be put on and I think I'm plans gonna be probably the Sun plus there's gonna be little to no fabrication because I'm just going to use some s bends and straights and so they can couplers once that's done we're gonna

(Start: 00:05:06)
start up the car I don't think we even start up the car just yet I have been doing a little bit of research and someone down in Cape Town you guys might know him on Instagram if you don't know go and follow him this channel has 12 24 or not I think he call it Channel and Instagram was page go follow him he's a model builder and a very experienced model builder and we actually gonna be collaborating sometime in the near future which is very exciting but I'm not gonna tell you girl anymore go follow him he's got ten times more subscribers than I've got even 12:24 has mentioned that since my car's been sitting for a while I should probably pour a little bit of oil down the the exhaust chambers of the a la em and then crank the car manually from the front so now I'm gonna do that a couple times for the next week and well at least stop the car in the next two to three weeks perhaps

(Start: 00:06:07)
once the car started then I need to get it down to get it up my driveway first then put it onto the flatbed take it to an exhaust shop get him to makeup down pop and lid pop and then link it to the back box of a HKS back box room once that's done I need to tune the car so do you have a copy-paste base map from another single server you guys all know Jason Jason's the dude in Sweden that's been helping me remotely worth research and well pretty much everything he's been assisting me on skype with his car and I've been asking questions even showing me on his card she's a really really cool he's given me his base map it is a very safe map it's not leaned out in a lot of places but obviously I'm not gonna floor the car I'm not gonna abuse it it's just to get us started to get it running have it drivable and then get it to H you know front let's move on oh okay that was the longest one so let's talk about the mr2 sw20 I got that car I have been driven in a

(Start: 00:07:09)
long while it's been sitting for about four to five weeks plus - but you know it's a tiara just get into the car turn the key and it runs in a never complain that's one thing about these damn cars and you know it is the slowest car and but it's probably one of the most fun it's got snap oversteer but not so much because I got the NA version of the three s GE so it's not the snaps oversteer thing that makes the car fun it's just fun because the engine see right behind you it's noisy and it's cool it's different there's a t-top as well yeah I mean it's just one of those cars that you cannot explain how fun or how cool it is until you get into the driver seat or maybe in the passenger seat and why don't I buy the car it was cheap saw the car online October 2017 made the gun offer he's actually subscribed on the channel hey if you're

(Start: 00:08:10)
watching a lovable JDM cause and this was on my list but very far down my list and we're just one of those things I don't want to let it go cuz I wasn't sure if I'd be able to import one or if I'll ever get another one and anyway I think I made a really good buy however the question is what am I doing with it right now right now is kind of just talked off and yeah waiting for a respray it needs to get resprayed and then I've been getting small little bits like I got some interior trim and it'll those plastics cookie things and just an evening up the car getting a mouse and sound and making sure it's gonna be kept for a very long time in my household so that's probably the most boring one out of all projects actually maybe not let's move on to the black or x7 fd3s [Music] so black or x7 fd3s you guys may

(Start: 00:09:12)
remember this my aborted in 2016 it was a little bit rough around the edges I picked it up for next to nothing and well I'm putting it back to stock I don't think I ever told you guys in the vlog but I moved the entire stock intake system from the silver 50 when I started stripping for the single turbo moved it across to the black ft and I put the stock dump fell up and everything back to stock on the black one the only thing I was not stock is the exhaust system now I was waiting to start single turbo build and I've been hella busy but I'm gonna move the stock exhaust from the same silver twin turbo oh geez I'm gonna move the stock exhaust from the silver fd3s across the black fd3s and then that will make the car 100% Stemmons you know the stock wheels of it someone did however steal the center caps on two of the wheels as the if any center gaps I

(Start: 00:10:12)
don't know why probably someone with an or exhibit anyway thank God I need to get another two and yeah the call be back to stock which is and then I pretty much saved the best for last here let's talk about the muscle Skyline r33 GTR [Music] I recently had an issue with that calling my intercooler pop-pop and rot off and I had to drive it back home there was no choice I couldn't stop where I was kind of turned around and I just blah blah blah blah blah blah made and I'm and black smoke everywhere and yeah fortunately there was no damage none that I've noticed yet I do you have an engine check light on at the moment and I need to do the whole Pinal thing so I can Tommy but the car is running and it's able to Rev Harley and it seems happy I'm guessing us an o2 sensor and since some of my pixie power FC I don't need the o2 sensor

(Start: 00:11:13)
I do need about wideband for this caught some stage I did buy hot band for it and now I'm using on the 54 the single service setup but anyway what are the parents of the E or 3c GTR get it running now fix the intercooler pop that popped off because I don't want that pop over again and I do want to go single server I mean there's guys like its Carter and goods alone there's so many youtubers out there that have gotten these singles over it and won the car sounds glorious when it's when it's got a one big blower and two you get a lot more power and three you simplify the whole thing much like Marek 753 s what I'm doing with the single turbo now the GTR however I'm not gonna skimp and say like I have on the FT so if I'm gonna be using stock injectors and

(Start: 00:12:13)
it's just it's been a very very budget build now the GTR has always been my favorite from the beginning it was my must-have JDM car from years ago I mean everybody says it's the same damn thing and I'm gonna be cliche about this Gran Turismo what caused the best vc GTR debatable but r32 GTR and always wanted one and i never had access to an app or because we want either in South Africa and now import laws are super strict so the closest thing I had to one of them was a Subaru a couple of supers and they're just never good enough and I mean the GTR is a car that I've owned the longest out of all cause I have earned I think I think plus or minus I've earned roughly 30 cars and the GTR

(Start: 00:13:15)
is the one that I've kept the longest I went through Seabreeze like crazy I had Anan series love all the same time I had maximum I go to all mad about three in one time I get that f3 let's say maximum of three series one time but one never money puts to the kept breaking three series on that bad don't buy another one but I've got other thing at the gt-r the selection our first problem with the GTR I've never had a major issue with it at all I mean self-inflicted issues yes like breaking the peace controller and a couple other thing but those were easily fixed this was the first time it actually gave up on me aware that it's gonna pop popped off it wasn't even a major major thing so athletes EGR is a cool car and I'm gonna make a really good build out of it when I have the time and money and like

Title: Smoke and hesitation on R32 GT-R! Blown RB26?
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuKK5bMZJ2s

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the vlog trying to smile yeah but I think I believe my RB 26 on my 32 G TR flip I don't know I don't know what happened I left home yesterday my usual stunts on a Saturday I go and drop off some of my cars by my parents house I have more space here for the trucks come in for innovation then well I made it about a kilometer up the road and I heard this really really loud bang and I lost a little power it didn't sound like an intercooler pop popping off and got me I've had that before once and arthi too and obviously immediately well I wasn't saying immediately pulled over and had a look but I didn't actually turn it around and I came back here but just black smoke everywhere car sputtering switching off I don't know what's wrong and I tried starting out this morning and I've got absolutely no

(Start: 00:01:00)
power I can't even get what I could even drive forwards so something's always wrong I mean here's the car a reversed pocket rizona I'll try figure out what's actually happening [Music] you guys hit it then it sound good at all everything looks fun I had an issue long ago you guys might remember some of your og subscribers but that's popped off so this pop shot down because I didn't have one of those little lips on this pop holding it together on campus that's not the case these pops intact the pop going through my manifold is intact Marta's just kind of rocking like that it doesn't sound good it doesn't really pop I don't know I heard a huge explosion when I was driving and I wasn't pushing the car I mean I just

(Start: 00:02:02)
left I was doing sloppy up a hill so there was a bit of talk but didn't push the car nothing happened it just went boom and so what's the game plan here I got to charge this Patriot on my camera because I kind of forgot it gasps holy crap no it's not another day I just changed my shirt because I'm I got my back in the Sun while I'm working it's freakin hot and I was wearing black before take it out it it actually took about 15 minutes to get the bump off it was so simple let me tell you guys exactly how I did it first before getting into the you're going to take the indicators out let's go there's one script operating you take out and you just kind of force it pull it and bang it out do the same for that one and then they are some clips there and there those need to come out and then underneath on the wheel well side roughly about here actually it is there there is a screw that fits on that side over there and then one on the other

(Start: 00:03:02)
side and nothing at the bottom there the bottom here yes this theory that needs to come out and then there was a bolt on the underside of here and that was obviously one on that side so however many on the floor there that's how many came off within the bumper just stood straight off there's a bumper okay I felt there she it is the intercooler pop but it's the bottom into the pot that one so it's connected data to the intercooler on that side and this piece popped off like to just popped off okay I need to sort this out the clamps were a little bit of an issue I probably need to get some new clamps at some stage so I'm going to put the bumper back on just yet but it's these little crocodile clamps I should probably put those little T bar

(Start: 00:04:03)
ones like I've been getting flow rx-7 but it does back on it's the moment of truth now let's hope this damn thing runs [Music] okay there's still something wrong it doesn't sound good at all a lot of operation in the Pappas but pops on somebody else's wrong proposal Eastern the damage when traveling in packs [Music] sounds like sounds like a bit of a misfire [Music] I don't know if I've popped something but next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna pull up the spark plug see if

(Start: 00:05:05)
I'm getting spark and I'm Debi I'm gettin spark'd but maybe maybe it ran a little bit too rich with lenticular pop popped off and I mean I did Drive it about a K and a half perhaps one of the spark plugs a but wait see if I got some done now and I think I know issues look up fouled as plug is come on camera okay here's my theory on the whole thing I think it cuz in tequila pop blew off my spark plugs fouled up because it was running way too rich you know just backfiring sir I've just started pulling off quite a bit actually first time donors ever which paid other people to do this for me working the dock actually looking really cool that's not thumbnail waiting to happen okay

(Start: 00:06:06)
pull the top cover here and I'm in taking the quill packs out not to get this off there's a bunch of screws that you can take off I think like ten screws new use an allen key to take this cut off they needed to loosen the plug on the distributor there's a plug at the back and then there's another plug yeah underneath and then you get all the coil pack the coil pack wiring there's a coil pack right there I'm starting on the first one and that's the plug that I've just showed you guys from them I'm just looking it up and did one by one not gonna bore you guys with that and then hopefully let's all pray that car starts first let me get up thumbnail yeah spark plug number two looking pretty filed as well but if this is right or wrong what I'm doing but quickly googled in this it's watch it with fuel it he is a cheaper and then I saw some people say it use a wire brush so I'll Lockley went over the wire Brent

(Start: 00:07:07)
and I've been kini with a toothbrush as well anyway that's one thing a little dirty will show you guys with him on number six here's number six Mike eNOS went up throw back and put that little distributor books on among I put the tip of cover or whatever you call it thing and spoke like Kevin and I'm gonna start the car okay here we go this is what I've done I haven't put that little cover that thing let's just one two mats this twin cam me full Velo and put that on and plug in the distributor box and all the coils are and I'll lay this come on boy come on [Music]

(Start: 00:08:08)

Title: Making My RX-7 FD3S FAST!!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDfkxYKF0lY

(Start: 00:00:00)
what is up guys and welcome to the vlog we back again with Gareth and John are sitting down in the corner already playing with some new toys what have we got finally it's everything is coming together and tonight is actually pretty surreal we're gonna be doing a test-fit of the turbo look what I'll go well currently look what Johnny got this is a DNA motorsport or DNA motoring manifold for the FD it's pretty decent I mean the welds on the inside I'm fantastic but the outside walls are okay I've been talking to some guys and to Jason as well about her safety and being about running a piece of flat bar across from this side here to the wastegate section and we'll kind of stopped the Flex on there and also with all the heat cycles this tends to crack around this area so I think the flat bar should help out that's what I'm gonna do but not right now this is gonna be a test foot sometime during this for like you guys are gonna see the turbo sitting right

(Start: 00:01:00)
there hopefully if everything goes well what else we planning we also want to just find all the gaskets and basically all the things that I need to cover with those blanking plates remember I showed you guys before I need to get one like for example on the uim there's the switch is the ISC idle speed controller and idle speed the trailer is redundant and I'm gonna need it that's going to come off so just example that's one of them I think it's about ten blanking plates so I need final stuff make the banking pets we also want to take the old oil lines out and then I'm going to take the old oil lines and obviously get them made up by electronics companies that's okay maybe give me yeah I've got one more just make a hole in the top over there Omega so I'm gonna call him got it so we've

(Start: 00:02:10)
been fighting for the last 45 minutes trying to get the damn manifold a fingers heat shield over here with that covers the bush one of the bushes underneath quoting some issue yourself just cutting the square piece over here I'm gonna see come on camera but I probably should have marked with Windows to tell me the first time I need to cut those pieces off so I'm gonna do that no any weight reduction whatever and then just doing a test foot without that heat shield all good marks here where'd you pick up the search a bit from did neither but there for you it's a turbo access to its equivalent to a Garrett GT 45 connect spawn somewhere it's big but if you look at the back there that's not that's odd it says that it is for an ft 3 s and if C 3 is 2 which is cool what it means it should put so gods matter falls on we good to go yeah it's kind of tempting us he's the

(Start: 00:03:11)
strongest one out of all of us because of that far out there ok that's what everybody else puts in Robocop so at that pops on across it will fit we live in Africa do you want me to heat up up yeah mark say how does a vlog house game awkward in like film being put in what's going on are just I'm going up Mutato yeah hey we should put all the stuff done it just seems like this is gonna suck you in the way you can cut this yeah I think we need to knock the other hammer yeah what's Q okay we push that one they also you can see

(Start: 00:04:27)
sit the house alone good job well then Nelson we busy toughening the bolts in the manifold again your honor so is what happens content oh yeah come now almost [ __ ] up my smart click bags yeah not lying here goes we drop something into my FD OB boy put this tube I need a thumbnail for reals I will see you like licking anything eating laughing that [ __ ] pickup killed my channel I took that four months of medical Anna

(Start: 00:05:35)
that's yeah it's you know it's solid when you can hold call okay so that all those shitty bolts onto now we're gonna go one stab wadester oh my gosh just by the by I lost a little about me but the [ __ ] studs fell off the box because when there's a limiter and burned him on that eBay sod on the side it wasn't even from and hold at the bottom of the box and the freaking studs came out wait who use these nuts yeah buzzworthy yeah but I wasn't even for the month for the skirt but the white skirt could have it yeah Mary Garrett's ago wait yes it's got balls holding at

(Start: 00:06:58)
most asking her he's filming for the vlog very important before you go anywhere Phyllis ask I mean you should build their support brackets I should so this is a teaspoon I'm actually Xbox so we sorts of them of both probably in America or eBay and my middle truth nice okay cuz it's chick my ways good oh yeah this ordinance crap I can see the 10 is caring that's all my needs to be talked a little bit yeah it's definitely possible oh that's caring everything I've lost

(Start: 00:08:00)
someone a mechanic so I'm talking about but I only learned a weird part recent subscribers well now we can use a lot of super meter holy [ __ ] yes tourism yep oh you know what I'm supposed to rob this damn weekend hasn't pineapple Polly thing I mean cool it's an urban I got a thing this is cannot supply oh no no it's not kid dude just like two hours we kind of forgot to pick up the camera well I did at least oil feed lon mostl miss yeah so this was sitting over there you see what banjo

(Start: 00:09:00)
bolt is that was parking over there around the coil packs just took it so and I cut them off and yeah anyway it's out so we need a measure now and wake up the distance between there to there and then get a hot roller company to make something up and then there's the oil return which is down the bottom somewhere so we measure that up as well and and the waste gets on that looks pretty sick yeah goes Chiklis up so we busy going through trying to figure out all these lanky plates that I've shown you guys before in the past and one of them is the double throttle system which here's the throttle body that was on the uim somehow like that but anyway that's all and how it works and what I figured out pretty weird so obviously this is the

(Start: 00:10:06)
throttle body and it's controlled by a furel cable which is connect to my pedal and it opens up these three butterflies but there was another part of our system over here that you can see I don't know what you call that like a butterfly rod thing so this is a double butterfly system and that's all coming out so there's an actuator on here that was controlled by a solenoid and this would open and close sometime don't know why it was on there it's coming out it's best practice to come out and what are you guys up to remove all monopod oh yeah so water pops coming out because it's in the way of whatever we pluck whatever by the way so that's gonna be the position this is that and it's people thanking place yeah the second one as well yeah this one was the idle speed control which is coming out and this is the double throttle control system here we go the gaskets well yeah yeah so John is busy

(Start: 00:11:07)
stepping away here we've actually done quite a lot of stuff I'm really into this is amazing yeah is this the gasket that goes on over that well yeah definitely yeah oh cool so we could collect the gaskets so he can make blanking plates are you freaking soon as I click mock uses talent yeah oh yeah okay good boy you slip up even more space read now this is that is goes onto the back of the you I am okay uh yeah I don't know what it is but it's for the breakfast and it goes on the back the valve inside here at one way

(Start: 00:12:09)
involve okay see the tool there and a real tools one should use axle with a blade the wrong way around yeah there's so much space down the file mark you in here we're not told dudes ordered some gold foil and reflect the foil to go on the L a.m. and on the sides yeah uh-huh white laughing and you're not seeing Aaron Parker's car you know Aaron Fargo you girls not iron poker know what's in Aaron Parker for me look drift or he's in his car he used to he was a mad max mechanic or some [ __ ] okay do you know Matt mark each other Doric seven seas down on Japan alright guys I'm gonna end the vlog here it's pretty late it's eleven something we've

(Start: 00:13:12)
got a tourism other trade has been clocked what guys what do we just do I don't remember a lot of blanking plates oh [ __ ] yeah so we've got all the gaskets here for all the blank plate so you can see I've marked them all off this one these don't exist this is on the Li M for the Zetas ym oh no it's on the uim so these don't exist on the JDM you i M so this is obviously USDM stuff what else do we do on the car knock now since the last time we phone [Music] stupid thing they underneath the Li and which is the air control valve that the crepes come out back on alternate is back on which is cool it doesn't need a little bit of a key nut but whatever I just want to get this car going again I got sucked back in it

(Start: 00:14:13)
we vacuumed the car and it's degreaser so I'm still gonna come out Rene clean up the turbo we need to do a bunch of [ __ ] here and we've pulled off that heater pop got completely broken I think a good full mmm and something else there was a split air pop the guys are on the back into the catalytic converter for some reason that's up here we guys that's it for me thank you so much for tuning in we'll see you all the next video [Music] let's go right [Music]

what is up guys and welcome to the vlog it's been quite a while since I've done any sort of content other than rx-7 big single turbo boat and I'm kind of sorry for that so not much is happening around there's not a lot that needs to be done on any of the cause other than rx-7 so that's like kind of why there's a bit of lack of content plus I've just really done under time because I'm working but my cause of filthy and I mean all of them okay maybe not all of them because the black rx-7 is not here but have a look at this one gasps they also took this one for drop with the reef off and oh it's a fun car they roll up I'm Sunita watch the Nexus that one but I had some bad luck with this damn car brand new tires new car and rear tire popped yeah whoops just realized I've been filming with the exposure really

(Start: 00:01:00)
really low I've got a big footy club green screen one of these pull up ones it's like 1.5 meters wide 2 meters high very cool I'm using it for some of that other stuff that I'm doing and yeah I kind of gotta say two exposure a little bit lower so that I capture the whole green because is my laughing so great anyway here's a progress on the FD until show you guys in the last video but as you can see pretty much everything's torn apart I have started at the decrease so okay a little bit bit of it okay that's better now I've got the expression said probably as you can see things are looking a little bit bitter sneer degrease and there's wire brush thing is like a manual once and I can go through those a little bit nervous using the drill I will however use the drill see those guys over there will use that I like this sort of stuff over here but then the hard-to-reach place I'm just gonna do it manually with a scrubbing brush with the wire in Zona

[Applause] [Music] how many girls haven't seen this in a while this is such a fun card to cover I've lost it around town today with yesterday and damn know what I drop that often you know I worked out recently the mileage that I've done on every single car this year 480 kilometers only obviously not the Lexus and not the listen Jupiter had prior to that but 480 kilometers pretty sad if you ask me anyway I'm gonna give them a wash I'll probably stop on that one and then work my way through I'm not gonna bore you guys with the whole carwash things let us do a quick montage

(Start: 00:04:10)
[Music] one done two to go sham I still haven't sorted out this car the care creditors at all or Blair in the front about these the eyelids and weighing up the back of the cars been nearly sprayed so this one also had clear coat damage on the top so this is all sorted 12th the dude that did it was kinda like a test like if you could pass this and the front then I'll send you the rest of the car I don't think I'm gonna do a test again I'm just gonna see in the whole damn car yeah the backs not so bad the front of this horrific

Title: Lexus GS200T Review
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJl7Wv82fdg

(Start: 00:00:00)
what is up guys and welcome to another video today it's gonna be something different it's gonna be another Lexus video however it's not my Lexus I was lucky enough to get a Lexus GS 200 handed to me this morning I went to go drop off my Lexus is250 it needed some spiky getting reprogrammed and well they caught on either I'm a vlogger cuz I seen the cameras and asked questions and I said well why don't you take one of our cars and I gave me a GS 200 T which is right in front of me now I mean this car is huge it is in the same league as a BMW 5-series those are the GS 300 T so it's a 2-liter turbo producing 180 kilowatts and 350 Newton meters of torque so it's not bad however there's a heavy car I think it's roughly 2 tons I haven't had a look yet but as a heavy car and it still goes and we're gonna go for a quick Drive in this clock so do you go drop it off from fit man so I figured why not let's make a little review on us so currently sitting on stock wheels he's 33 545 18 little

(Start: 00:01:01)
bigger than the Lexus is250 earlier were 2 3 545 17s so the rum stars has definitely increased the front end of the car is very very good-looking it's got daytime running lost on the frontier mast big wad grill it's good like a space-age top theme going on it but I dig it I love it you know these damn dealerships they give you these cars and they give you a better model in what you have so that you want to go any one has great hills in you want to buy a new one best I don't know so much about these but that's like a fake exhaust thing underneath there's little peashooter anyway it still looks cool good parking distance controls good keyless entry all the bells and whistles more so than when I've got on my is 250 now I'm gonna walk up close to the car and usually some lot Sun oh there we go so there is a lot of there so it's picked up that I'm near the car and unlocked and beeped side mirrors came out and now this is cool so

(Start: 00:02:02)
before I jump into the interior these are air cooled seats and they heated as well got a little perforated holes in it and what else have we got you huge long dashboard it's a big car like I said it's like comparable to five series that's a foot on the brake and there's a push start button here as I push that steering wheel readjust and my seat goes forward very cool big infotainment loads and loads and loads of features on this car they start with the cluster so it'll display in the middle here where you can take a look at that I've got a low fuel it shows you your compass shows your mileage range your radio station that you're on so pretty much the same that's on there but small of you more folks for the driver and the stuff on here it's got up to 260 cares and hours could your fuel gauge rpm heat pretty much standard stuff on this side on the door you go full auto windows you've got some settings for the seat so I can adjust each seat specific to my city so I can mean them one more

(Start: 00:03:03)
often be number two number three can be a random person over here there's another display let's pull the climate control now if I push these you can actually see it going up and down right over there on the side we've got the controls for the infotainment now it's kind of like a touchpad for a mouse so I'm just moving that up-down left-right and I can't just moved it around let's go across the menu it's obviously it's got sat-nav and on here it's got the normal telephone and that's got your media which is USB and Bluetooth and obviously CD it's got a six - shuttle actually all these Nexus models got a six this shuttle in the front which is pretty cool hope that I use CDs much climate control is all done electronically and if you're wondering how difficult it is to get to all these

(Start: 00:04:04)
things it's actually quite easy because every time you land on one of these it locks the mechanism here so for example if I want to get to the button just left of that so one of these two we're not moving it actually locks it in place so it doesn't go all the way and jump all around it locks it so it's last user-friendly and I don't have to run around and trying to figure out what I'm doing while I'm driving so super cool it's going to Dolby Digital system sound in those cars vehicle I don't have any music with me so I can really test I was listening to the radio but damn it still sounds great speak over there the speakers on the top on the left side and then there's multiple speakers in the back so there's like a tweeter on the top of the door is a better answer the back and the speakers in the back there it's like a seven system surround I don't have lots of compartments just

(Start: 00:05:04)
like the Lexus is250 but a lot more space obviously so this you can put tea cup holders where is it is 250 you can I put one over here and then we've got the normal glove compartment box which does that and then there's some stuff over there is the laughs connectivity and it flips up and there's a bunch of stuff but two USB devices in here to listen to music and it's got your normal turn off a French stare at mini-jack much like the is250 it has got parking distance control and it's also got a reverse camera however thus I do not have in the is 250 when I drop the con to reverse the sod mera readjusts how cool is that and there's my camera very cool so that is see the little lines there it's identical to what I've got on the is 250 is just a lot less laggy very responsive very cool the

Title: My daughters favorite JDM car!

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to a quick little video recently I'll ended up taking my daughter to all of my JDM cards and she's only 2 years old so she doesn't really know cause I think she knows about a car that it goes Brum Brum she's never been to my GTR she's never been lauric 7 she's never been for a drive and then at all and last week sometime I decided ok let me just take her inside the cars and later piratical buttons and the dashes and all stuff and she absolutely hated the origami but did not enjoy it at all there was a bit too cramped because she was sitting on my lap winner in in the cars and I say in the front seat there are any front seats and but I liked it so he quickly jumped out she loves the Lexus both 3 2 GTR she played for like two three minutes and she would get out and her absolute favorite car well there's anyone left it's the a more two out of all cause the MRT and I'm gonna show you why so first

(Start: 00:01:01)
things first once you get in there is a lot more legroom and yeah then the rx-7 that she just didn't like as a space this one she absolutely loves because there's so many compartments so much stuff ready to play with so the first thing is she was bouncing around with was this club box she landed up scruffing up on my last and sing stuff so the glovebox open close this little compartment here and then the same thing here this was absolutely nothing I mean I could have maybe put a cup holder here but you know JDM cause and pretty cupholders however behind you of these so she's playing a lot of that which is pretty cool so you don't feel quite a bit of stuff from the author I my keys in there and it's not the easiest to access I kind of have to turn around grab the stuff close it up and there's this little compartment

(Start: 00:02:02)
so I should probably actually throw my keys in there but anyway you get the point so there's its multiple compartments in the car there's another one behind the seat there's a little cover that goes over there don't mind that so there's a speaker down here and then a little compartment again this one has the speaker's of compartment pretty useless there's another compartment behind me though so it looks kind of like that but it goes all the way down I don't know I read it on some forum that Americans like putting guns inside they are denied and take my word for it anyway she absolutely loves this car and that's why cuz she couldn't has like lots of stuff to play with it still build anything this thing up so I put new gear Gators on and you get one of those little surrounds for the radio and I mean readings working after that listen to it

(Start: 00:03:04)
in the air but always working oh well staring all needs to be sorted out I'm gonna borrow my my wand but I got a lot more stuff to worry about like a big single-server little busy sorting out all of us that's it for the video just a quick less than five minute video as to why my daughter likes this car and that's just because there's so much stuff that you play with because let me know what video you guys want to see next if you want to see some shenanigans in the r32 GTR or I don't know maybe go for another Drive in the Lexus or maybe in this car let me know in the comment section I know I've been I've been busy but I'm gonna make some time alright everyone that's it for the video thank you so much for watching I'll see you all next time Cheers oh blue 28 sit over you Ferrari drops across this room spit him out [Music]

what's up guys and welcome to the vlog I'm here with my teammates we're gonna be working on the rx-7 ft3 is finally sitting up the camera and doing a little bit of work what are we going to be doing well we're gonna be pulling off that manifold I didn't tell you guys but there's an actuate over here and I kind of broke the boat and I was rushing one day to get it off so a bit of an issue so we're gonna try jack up a car now try get that actuator out get that manifold off and then we're gonna start working on those pulling all the crap out all the Solarize that are not used and then we're gonna run the harness for my wideband and harness with my HK CBC so let's get right to it so we just need get this thing off but that actually that I mean if you pull on that - it feels loose is it well just yank or not see it you guys - it's just being held on by the rod from what it seems and I'm pretty sure there's a circle up on that rod actually I've felt I think I felt it there is that was holding a piece in

(Start: 00:01:02)
place no sir I got first prize let me get underneath the car see if I can pawn that circle oh yeah get the rod off and then hopefully it falls down you think we take the putter down there with the flesh not gonna see what's happening from underneath last time with me yeah just looking in here let me know okay that's a good job so is that a metaphor

(Start: 00:02:22)
that racket you go get sick off the boss time much did you I got lots of it you see you until I've been working no my hands this that is definitely coming up you are contemplating wife's giving this whole thing and then yeah okay you're predicting me I told you what a bit idea

(Start: 00:03:23)
with all this in between no okay all the [ __ ] does this poor people okay I think but it actually loosing yes is this you guys good yes what a serious gasket yeah [ __ ] look at thickness a lot you know that is heavy oh yeah how's that oh that thing not

(Start: 00:04:35)
this ball too useful huh go skip yeah and I'm sure you take that steel door from the subframe as well I don't know they're nuts is that to the other side shouldn't say ever knows only their price change I can feel us over here again yeah you should probably take it over yeah I don't think you need to I thought it does much but I'm checking underneath the coach-office better I see there's a big pop nice really oh yeah is anything else on here Thanks these dudes yeah oh yeah that's like that which seems to be postures no on her okay so this thing comes off yes okay definitely moist Lawson I'm good brand-new Chiba nice one yeah

(Start: 00:05:48)
okay all right this is a bolt over here look like a 10 I am in oh [ __ ] yeah it looks like there's another there's another vacuum hole and I yeah but we can loosen the bolts and then when I cut

(Start: 00:06:50)
it you can have all these vacuum money replacement yeah yeah nice so I actually said check these are couple forums for the Troubleshooters mentors to check these guys out but they look intact well anyway taste those actually stripped this whole [ __ ] apart it was a [ __ ] bolt but I know that you can that's one way to do but all right there's another way we don't have to have the feel pressure we get a solenoid yeah and you just need to do something on the map okay but there's a whole how-to on bypassing the fuel pressure regulator solenoid maybe I should go that route yeah see what your friends and don't as well all right guys we got into a point it's like you live in PMS and I think we're gonna cool it or not we got a lot of stuff done like you saw a little metaphor came out that's out of the way ways a [ __ ] ton I'm actually keeps not weighing all this stuff in the scene how much we're going to take out how much I'm gonna put in and then

(Start: 00:07:50)
seeing the difference I know a lot of people have done it overseas but yeah I want to do it myself anyway let me show you what we're done with a little bit of cam but get manifolds off this side we got this little vacuum chamber ship which are through down here so this crap has out this dude set somewhere over here we have to take the oil filler neck out to get to that and yeah then we got this vacuum chamber out with all the solenoids I'll show you guys and we you know why I took the hardline stilling to come out we're gonna call it a day now or not I think that's pretty much it I was just saying to the guys I need to get all these blanking plates made up so and then I need a decrease and clean the engine and then we gonna reassemble and tackle this [ __ ] again you know guys that's it for the vlog thank you so much for watching we'll see you all next time

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJzpLuC8O88

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys and welcome to the vlog been a little while since I've been in the garage actually has been a little while since I picked up the camera ended a vlog with the rx-7 I was in here about two weeks ago I had a mate of mine Gareth and one of my subscribers actually came in and assisted me with taking out the twin turbos we actually led up working from about 6:00 in the evening and we finished that I think 130 plus minus a.m. it was just a hell of a balls like soul okay this is how MTV Bay is starting to look I'm getting there twin turbos are out the county sitting on the floor a little size comparison between that so I mean that's a hell of a lot bigger versus these two this is what the twins look like Garrett is blown that bloody miss don't have time to get in here but car is looking a lot better I need to start heating up and moving stuff out of the UAM and obviously just making space for what's to come so I was talking into listen like a couple minutes exactly what I'm gonna be doing and what am i referring but first I actually need some help so set up my laptop here got internet access and I need to scalp call one of

(Start: 00:01:02)
my subscribers who we've actually become friends now we talk or except and stuff and that's Jason he joined my channel probably about a year and a half ago plus - and he's gonna or except not 25 top M I think and it's got a big single server and he's helping me remotely with my build giving me Gardens and telling me what to do and well without him I probably be pretty much stuck I mean there's a lot of stuff on the internet but it's all mixed opinions and his kids is working the way he set it up so I'm kind of following suit so let's try give him a call Merrigan here is car I don't know let's see guys I'm on skype right now with Jason this is the masterpiece that I was talking about this is what I'm trying to copy obviously I won't have any going front-mount like I've mentioned the pause I'm going for a V mounts it up but what you see here is what I want to do and obviously Jason is guarding me remotely it's quite difficult but we're getting through it so huge thank you to

(Start: 00:02:04)
Jason just finish on the Skype call jason has been such a help did I know you're watching us thank you so much I really appreciate it let me tell you guys quickly what is what is happening so the deal is I wasn't exactly sure what to pull out underneath the uim and what's needed services there's one solenoid a that controls the fuel system and then I need if you go back to model diagrams is a stock - until go on here's the single turbo if it that I'm going to be following so here's a fuel pressure regulator and it goes all the way over here to the solenoid that's the only solid I need these four are gonna piss off and then whole chamber thing at the top isn't us off see I've got the four and then there's another one somewhere at the back there so I'm gonna install here making this all up alternate it needs to come out mmm it doesn't really need to but it is going to come out because it'll give me a lot more room to play these hard logs gonna come out that's an oil return and that's gonna come out there's some vacuum hoses and yeah some vacuum

(Start: 00:03:06)
chambers like that that's gonna oh come out then I start working my blanking plates I'm gonna get them laser-cut there is this place that sells them called Ben's iRacing I think these guys well sorry 11 so Africa it expensive gift from you guys so I'm gonna be laser cutting my shirt and getting them nasty bolts and blah blah okay what's the rest of the plan is obviously I'm gonna clean up all the [ __ ] I need to take this manifold off interesting thing if you guys can see there there's that it's like a piece of ceramic or porcelain on the manifold and thus those gar moves in and out it's connected to a rod which is then controlled by this actuator over here and obviously that's it up by a solenoid somewhere that's controlling it and what it does is it kind of blocks the entry on the exhaust housing for the twin-turbo setup and I'm assuming I don't pay much attention because I don't really care about the twin-turbo setup anymore but it blocks up the single

(Start: 00:04:08)
TEVAR and blocks of the primary or whatever it blocks off the primary turbo or secondary turbo in have one running vice-versa Lola that's my own assumption I don't know what else anyway that's stray there I need to take that [ __ ] off and use some tin snips just cut around that heat shield get manifold or forget the actuator out toss that in the bin I don't know what I'm gonna do those two ways anyway here's the size say stock twins and here's my big boy you can see the size of that exhaust housing versus these so this would be one tip on sign over here there's a little bit just look at the size difference absolutely massive turbo is a lot bigger can't wait to have it on like a hold on to the story whatever needs to go on I need that manifolds and maybe x-min affords me coming up it's

(Start: 00:05:10)
the way for a whole bunch of parts because I live in Safra it takes whatever one of them is the what he call it pineapple racing pulley that's gonna be getting on there come on gauge this is my am wideband that's here actually never had a in product before every time I did a wideband I always did an innovate the first time I am like I said I'm trying to mimic whatever Jason is what am is what he's got at least then he can help me battery relocation still needs to be done down Papa needs to be done HKS EBC that needs to go on the car and external wastegate obviously a lot more to do on this car once I get all the stuff off I want to have a detailed and cleaned in the engine bay I would say I'm gonna do everything myself because that's sort of like they see stuff like yeah there's a lot of Grom that needs to be cleaned up okey dokey that's it for the vlog a little bit of short one just showing you guys what's up one of

(Start: 00:06:11)
the guys come back again and assist me one of these yuning's and start ripping stuff apart getting alternate off and all that and i think next time we actually could do a proper vlog because the previous one was just work work work work work and we works 1:30 in the morning and minimal ship talk it was just grond and era makingtreks bigots myself i'm not paying anybody so I'd like that little sticker that you can Bob built Lockport kind of feels good again hello mister Tom it's the first time I'm in the garage looking at the car in two weeks anyway Gus thank you so much see you all next video [Music]

(Start: 00:00:00)
what is up everybody and welcome to a brand new sitter what is up everybody and welcome to a brand new series called midnight reviews and to not we are gonna be reviewing an is250 so there's actually a vehicle that I bought recently for my wife she needed an automatic so I figure I get her something that has a little bit of luxury and that was the is 250 now this is pretty much the perfect car for her one its automatic too it's got all the luxury three it's got all the safety we need for her and for the kids and for its Alexis it's pimping so you know what I figured every single Tom Dick and Harry does a car review during the day let me do one during the evening let's see how this goes so this is the midnight review of the Lexus is250 so our students cause fully-featured has all the bells and whistles being an executive version it does have a few extra that the others don't have for example it's got keyless entry I'm gonna walk up in the other car and you're gonna see that these lots are gonna switch on how cool is that so kind of a little welcome I'm here let's open the door now to open the door you don't push

(Start: 00:01:00)
any buttons you just slide your hand behind you and it unlocks nice little latch on the door the footwell pedals there now see looking up saw the passenger side that's big large ishani up a whole cockpit with regards to the interior a lot of people may think well it's quite bland that's until you push the start button and everything Lots up so stock it's equipped with leather seats plenty of room in the back we do need a baby seat in there let's jump in so steering wheels pretty normal it's got a whole bunch of controls in here we'll show that in a sick let's take a look at the lighting fish so I'm about to close the door maybe obviously got this brought light in here I want to show you how subtle it is when I close the door see how doesn't so subtly that is really cool everything is so well thought out in this car now that lot takes about 20 to 30 seconds and completely shuts off right so you can see the engine start button all right over here once put your putting a break

(Start: 00:02:01)
a little lots gonna pop up that means it's ready push start you cluster pack flies up and down and that Sean's up Lexus I'm not gonna bore you guys with little features we're just gonna take this Ford drive but it's got set now that's got voice controls of all those store button voice recognition push the talk switch after the beep say a command telephone telephone say a command see what I mean obviously this is all touchscreen clamor control touchscreen audios got USB audio it's got CD it's actually got a six disc shuffle change it in the front and then some USB audio obviously telephones linked you just saw that now so lotting in a switch to Lansing on here that's your main cabin lot then you've got two other lots so these are your personal reading lot so if I hit that switch it's gonna shut off the seat and if I hit the switch it's

(Start: 00:03:02)
gonna shut up my seat pretty cool you can see everything is now nice and lit up awesome looking Kevin very cool so over here a little cup holder is a lot in here a little bit more visibility every has little storage compartment I've just ran a set of keys in here and there's a lot Nick too and then here is your main storage compartment and see how that flipped up and we just leave me here for Godzilla more often see GTR and that actually flips up I see in the back there is air conditioning and bunch of other stuff for the passengers cupholders etc that's got a lot in the two cupholders there then some storage compartment etc and these are interesting cupholders so that actually flips up empty I can that's just there just to show the functionality but I actually don't have time to clean up the car anyway I'm gonna flick over to the GoPro and let's go for drop alright guys we are on the

(Start: 00:04:04)
right of the Lexus is250 I have no idea how this is gonna look I'm hoping visibility is okay average at best so let's talk a little bit about this car what's under the hood there's a 2.5 liter v6 engine it's producing 153 kilowatts and 260 newton-meters it now the car is quite heavy however the 2.5 v6 does produce enough power to make it move quite fast I mean I've been rather happy of the car one I mean it's very luxurious it's very comfortable when I Drive to work I'm driving to work really slowly now I'm actually getting up a little bit later because I'm enjoying spending time in traffic with the car which is stretch I mean I came from the nursing jig and sometimes driving it and one of the other calls but I mean it's the six-speed manual still charged fun draft I get me wrong very cool grout but this is so user-friendly and luxurious and just makes you feel like you're driving to work on a steeper couch now someone told

(Start: 00:05:04)
me the other day that it's one of the only cars around then once you reach a destination you actually feel more relaxed than when you lift and that it's so damn true everything is just so easy to use is so friendly on this car for example I want the passengers to be a little bit cooler I'll just hit this and it goes more Kessinger temperature I want to be a little bit water so the red one that brings me up to 24 degrees Celsius also cool shows by the temperatures and all the passengers are feeling I'm feeling I got my audio controls in the air with myself system or climate control is very cool I dig this fully electronic my display I can adjust the brightness and sort of stuff you see telephone integrator McKellan there as well so you see meetings and work stuff set a nerve so pretty much all the basics to make this a luxury car and make you feel comfortable on the way to your destination another thing to bear in mind is that it is super quiet

(Start: 00:06:05)
cruising right now at about 65 cares are and there's a lot of people anything in here is a slot rental of a stupid cocaine that was left in the door now it's currently sitting on 2/3 far something 17 inch tires which are made by Michelin sport the pretty decent uh never had Michelin's before but the quiet and they seem to grip again I have spun the wheels in this car few Tom's and let me tell you it's fun now if you can see the cluster side it's nicely lit up with a little bit of blue and white tinge and it tells me stuff like outside temperature how much range I have lived in two kilometers with fuel consumption that's all stuff the basics but obviously only this stuff I kind of leave it on my outside temperature because that's pretty much all do and yeah the range thing I like to get like because it gives me anxiety you know petrol I'm using on a daily driver

(Start: 00:07:06)
I don't look at that it will obviously go to normal field counter I worry about that the steering we all go to my buttons or my controls in there nothing special I do however have flappy paddles wasn't cool and honestly speaking of only use them once so on the side on the gearing section egotistical Park reverse neutral and then your giraffe makes the drive it's got a little s it's nothing fancy here at home about but it does make the response and the gear changes slightly faster on dumping in sport mode and on this side just underneath the steering wheel we've got ET CCTV power and snow so that's traction control I'm gonna set it to power mode and let's give it a test dashboard actually lots of orange when

(Start: 00:08:08)
you flooring it coal elf you [Music] [Music] [Music] when your plants are good you can actually hear that v6 tryna break free it is sorry Shelton right now by the exhaustion behold at middle it really sucks I'm sure once opened up there was sound monsters now the power delivery is really smooth it's one of those things to get used to because I'm obviously a turbo kind of guy and well

(Start: 00:09:10)
there's no to Versailles you got instant power and the gear changes of quick and a lot of people like what America automatic less that it's really quick that's obviously not golf saving to tree but the gear changes are damn forest so I'm not - it's actually sherry with the ramen fourth yeah I can drop they're using all flappy pedals down to the little [Music] [Music] really impressive redhead lick the cross sticks like a pig in [Music]

(Start: 00:10:11)
[Applause] so just a quick bang of the fist and I'm back into drive now I'm back to normal gentleman's car I'm a switch this back over to normal traction it kinda just makes the transmission just acting a little bit quicker and obviously it's got that slice sitting which I'm assuming and just gives you a little bit more grip so there's still a little pull off here you can see how quick we can get off the line now I'm not going to dial it up I'm just going to floor it and let me tell you it is not bad at all let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me tell you something even though it's got a 2.5 liter v6 with 153

(Start: 00:11:12)
kilowatts and everybody it still goes and pulls off damn quick and you're racing while sitting on a couch which is the best part now I'm gonna be brutally honest to you guys my wife is going to be taking everything's calm pretty soon she doesn't start driving it and I'm gonna be quite sad actually because I've grown a little bit of a lock into this car and it's comfortable it's nice to get away again and bloody hell it's a freaking Lexus so sad but happy that's gonna go to here because well I'm gonna be able to write for Carla [Music] anyway guys that's the short and tall of the Lexus is250 if you guys enjoyed this review hit me all the thumbs up I'm gonna try get back into this whole content make you think maybe let's try to do the mid not series

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey what's up guys and welcome to the vlog I'm so sorry it's been a while since I actually picked up this camera but so much has happened in the last three plus minus weeks not so much has happened on if to even I'll get into the sick so what's been going on in my life well a lot of family stuff a lot of house renovation stuff and one I got rid of missing Juke it was a turbulence and you could I had I bought my wife Alexis and she wanted an automatic so I got an excess automatic it's got the full house and Scott set nervous but heated seats it's got air cooled seats let's go please everything you can think of heated side mirrors you name it so pretty pretty stuck to the cards damn awesome but I'll do a full vlog on the Nexus at another stage very cool car truck that's going to the FD as you can see I've done quite a bit of work but the turbos are slow on the car I'm pretty limited with Tamara now so I'm working about three hours a week sometimes two hours a week on the car last week isn't working at all because my daughter's sick but I hope to get in

(Start: 00:01:00)
here again soon maybe over the weekend a couple hours what's left turbos are on the oil pups are on the still need to come up you I Emma's off I've started cleaning up and I'm still not finished they're down pop is completely off all the turbo inlet pops that wolf pretty much everything that kind of connects the turbos is both like what eight bolts to take off here I've printed out all these pages to kind of like give me an idea with what I'm working with and over my board here and all the stuff that's on yeah so here's the stock twin-turbo setup big rat's nest if you haven't seen this before this is what it looks like all these vacuums and solenoids and actuator for the repeaters the rat's nest damn terrible and then here's what it's going to look like this is my single to our diagram you can see it's a lot cleaner than the other one and then obviously I've bought a HK CBC controller that's going to be going inside with my stuff they're just assembly from the user manual or except the manual then blanking plates these are the blanking plates I need to make for certain parts in the car so obviously for example I don't need my a

(Start: 00:02:01)
control valve anymore some when you're making a blank plate for that my a CV tube blankie play there's a kit that you can actually buy from these guys Benz are racing but I'm not gonna do that because I'm a cheap ass and I'm gonna get all of these laser cut and made up not a big deal and if you caught a glimpse of us I don't smoke I found us an rx-7 it's a high light full to cigarette and there was also a smoke with some 810 years probably full of cigarettes so I can read Japanese coming up this is what Garrett is in an absolute state because like I said limits at the top let me show you what I've got so far and tell you what to still on the way the start of the basics I worked in the battery terminals because one I'm relocating the battery to the boot battery just to sit right over here batteries not gonna move and it needs to go in the boot because I need to put a remount intercooler which was set over here that out the way here's my battery cable and it's a full gauge cable which I believe is enough for this calm the GTR in for a zero gauge cable I think

(Start: 00:03:02)
that pretty overkill the other way this side I have got 50ml dump valve assembly going on my intercooler pop the plan is to have that pop that comes off the uim then I call it a compensation pop so that black Papa comes over there I'm gonna be chopping that pop and half I know there's a cool Grady elbow that you can buy but I'm cheap black pop trouble and a half and I might be doing some tubing over here to the intercooler and that's gonna be sitting on the side of the cheering and then obviously I'll change springs and adjust it accordingly so that's number one number two I'm too lazy to open the box is a waste gate there's a picture on the screen right now then actually have a box which is somewhere lying around edge case EVC easy so it's the easy model which means it's easy to sit up and it's just got hard boost low boost and that's all a little bit different as opposed to my one in the GTR because the GTR one I can do offset and I can do base to rpm and

(Start: 00:04:04)
each other crap but obviously I need this it's just gonna be a plain and simple setup whatever you guys have seen this really forgot the sizes offhand but thus turbo setup was meant for an rx-8 a nifty it came off a nifty so it's already physically turned and whatever should other knew how to set but we found exhaust will say I'll get somebody to weld it up and put a proper down pop on for me I'm gonna be BAM the whole damn thing here's the stock down pop on the floor in the way ready for me to trip over and there's the dump of the twin-turbo setup but obviously I'm not going to be using that I will probably sell that but I'm too lazy to sell it right now that I can sell as well hi pixy twins and got in a box somewhere amongst this oh oh this way those

(Start: 00:05:05)
HK super popular very good so right what am I waiting for I'm waiting for four more things to rough one opx manifold really cool manifolds coverage from the states I'm hoping in the next three weeks plus - number two is a pineapple racing pulley product basically isn't a suit over here so the purpose of this pulley if you guys don't know already deleting that air pump that sits over there can be putting a pulley on because I need to run the belt on there now a lot of people do run a belt that goes from here to the alternator and the problem is this is the water pump if the belts running here you get a lot of slip on the water pump and sometimes the car the heats and some people say it's bad some people say it's alright I don't want to take a chance doing a pineapple Racing pulley right there that's something I'm waiting for right what else fuel pump fuel pressure regulator or bro 320 it's also an ethanol compatible one yeah you far compatible

(Start: 00:06:06)
that's fueling I'm going I'm not doing anything crazy in the feeling so just a starter set up there not got a day to log it that actually have an order the data logger data logger is going to be coming from New Zealand as far as allows me to place my pixie power FC which means I can tune out I can load maps and save maps do it and the final thing which should be here next week is the wideband which are gonna be blue I've got an ATM you a ger once I got all that stuff then obviously stop doing the pop work for the intercooler which will be going over here might be doing my own intercooler system our own custom one I mean I'm gonna be going for a 450 sir 450 across by 250 I think it was and then its thickness was Sydney sucks so it should set up to about here and come up to about there - relocate this I don't know but I'm doing my own custom setup I'm not going to be spinning my thousand something dollars on a ve mount intercooler which ya crazy

(Start: 00:07:06)
money anyway that's the story for this car a little bit of a long one well let's go take a look at the gt-r good GTR so not much has been done on the gt-r at all I did manage to get it up into the road and I did manage to get the boost consider to get the boost controller setup crickey got a boosting at 1.15 bar and yeah decent I've done the offset coffee feels great that's the story let's go I'm not doing anything else one of the hit laughs just pops I need to change the LED on that what's happening at the a marked C I've been getting some parts resprayed so I was testing out a spraying dude and like I mentioned the garage because I'm cheap I've been testing someone out again before show they're gonna show you these things excuse the mess here though I kind of like made this temporary makeshift thing could I get possible you guys remember this book German Shepherd what's this rocker and then that is Marla so we go to print fun anyway back to the

(Start: 00:08:06)
mr2 I had the wing resprayed because this was dull like super dull a wing as we sprayed now it looks pretty good you can see the eyelids or lasagna then the bonnet Andrea the bottom needs to be sprayed in the front bumper needs to be resprayed but I'm gonna say and obviously this all back again I'm just testing someone and came out good I'm happy I don't want to go back to this dude and you can straighten the edges and make this thing flush it and spray it nasty sides of the car cool and the back needs a little touch-up here in there other than that mr2 is looking better oh there's Alexis anyway that's it from me just figured I'll give you guys a little update or rather are you guys an update it's tough for me to pick up the camera run now when I'm number two the

(Start: 00:09:06)
summer time because I'm working in the evenings of working during the day I will not going on if you guys won't check me out I'm also blogging everyday JDM stuff I've got a curation guilded I'm part of where there's multiple writers I'm one of them and we're at daily JD and Content ID Japanese cartoons and horror stuff links in the description and flashing on the screen right now it's d mmit calm food stash at nelq LJ TM so go check that out also you'll probably see a lot of stuff that's actually happening to the cause before you see on YouTube so what pretty much everything I've told you now it would have been almost emailed like two weeks ago so go check that out plus it's monitor so if you guys want to start vlogging vlogging doing let's--oh stuff go on their post pictures talk about it rot good articles and you will get paid to blog and let me know I'll come and support you guys I can give a couple dollars here and there that is it for me felt good to pick up the camera again for some reason but yes as always thank you so much I'll see all the next vlog Cheers

Title: Mazda RX7 FD3S Big Single Turbo - 1 : Teardown and Turbo
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qzCXvPZayE

(Start: 00:00:00)
what is up guys and welcome to the vlog I am back yet again with this rather empty looking Oryx 7 ft 3 years that's rod I decided that I'm going single turbo it's happening ok so here's my plan I'm gonna be buy a whole lot of pots one of which is obviously a tear well it's actually here I'll show you guys in a sec but I'm buying a whole bunch of pots - you go a single to her because I'm over this so you got a saw in the last video I was betting to get my hands in there just everything was one big battle now they got lost video was just a desaad it was a cherry on top couldn't get the whatever you call this thing here the biddin lip thing for the rear turbo I couldn't get that out because of space and I was better than getting the warp out out and yeah anyway everything is just one big battle and I figured stuff what let's go single server so here's the plan I'm going to go very basic and then I'm going to be building on this because I would see us still wanna save money to collect other JDM cars and I also want to work on the

(Start: 00:01:01)
art that eetzi GTR and do a bunch more mods to that car so my focus is not the RX isn't my focus just to get it on the road so here's the plan I'm going to be using stock injectors obviously I want to keep the boost la macchina so that mine Jake the GT cycle isn't peaked or maxed up I'm gonna be changing the fuel pump I'm going to be adding a fuel pressure regulator so that'll take care of fueling turbo I'm gonna be putting in the second-hand turbo which was recon I'll show you guys in the sick with the intention to buy a better one maybe like a bog 100 or a whole set etcetera in the future they don't decided that I'm going to be going for a V mount intercooler with pop work aluminium or alloy pop with a career record so I'm gonna be doing something like that then I'm gonna be doing a pineapple racing pulley I'm gonna be getting a wideband I'm gonna be putting on a data logger obviously I need to know what's happening on the ECU side and there's a couple other small nibbly bits but for the most part that's

(Start: 00:02:02)
it so whatever I've done here pretty much pulled out everything from the front end so the Intex was sitting over here there now on the floor actually all of this is part of our exhibit intercooler pops the intercooler I mean look how small it is it's tiny stuff it was like a airflow box thing you know and I watch it's cooler pops chod relief valve air bypass valve here pumpers after that's gonna be staying out like I said I may be putting the pineapple racing pulley because I need to replace this belt over here so a lot of people just get a small belt which goes from that pulley to here but apparently there's not enough grip for the water pump to run and cause any heat and all that sort of stuff so I'm getting a pineapple racing pulley which will sit over here it's just an idler and then it'll come around the sand back there apparently it's a little good I'm going to keep my ast and I'm gonna mount that somewhere it's gonna be temporary

(Start: 00:03:02)
then I'll get an alloy one at some stage so Y pipe is coming out obviously then my uim is gonna come out all these solenoids all these vacuum pops that stuff you I am is gonna go back on and the wall pops in style pharmacy and the turbo is gonna come out and put a big single server here here's my radiator I always the fence and took the fans of why you need to remember I used to complain about my rx-7 running super hot it was sitting here like a hundred to 105 degrees after a spirited drive maybe like 95 if I was just crazy it was super hot and I take like 20 minutes just to cool down I just thought it was an F D thing because everybody complains that it gets so hot and I could never really tell the temperature on the black wire well I found the issue where's the other fan I see a fan there are those so the fan broke clean off from here just for a little bit of putty on there just to hold together and I've actually decided and scrapped this in

(Start: 00:04:02)
bar holding unit but for a little bit of time I thought maybe I should repair it and then try balance it myself but you know I'm wasting time and wasting money just buy a new one and be done with it so you'll see in a picture this was all melted something caught on fire in here those teeny broke often and stayed on there and the whole fan unit was just lying around floating on top there so I only had half my radiator cooling which is super dangerous anyway Tom for the tuba here she is this is excuse me miss this is a 0.60 compressor housing with a 0.85 exhaust housing it's an excess pellet over it's been recalled and it was a little bit wasteful way in terms of the aesthetics when it arrived it wasn't clean properly when I say wasn't clean property it

(Start: 00:05:03)
involved me taking a mini wire wheel and the big wire wheel and yeah making it look pretty anyway not a bad thing this turbo is specifically designed for its era so this turbo specifically designed for the FG this actually will plate in the back here that states that it's for the FC 3 is in the fd3s in terms of manifold I forgot the name of it wasn't a turbine anyway it was a three millimeter welded one that's not a cheap eBay one so basically I'm gonna spend the money on all the other stuff and turbo I mean I can do lost I'm just going to annoy an abuse this turbo hard and I was going to be a couple haters odds excess power it's not it's not a wholesale BorgWarner I know that but I've gone through countless forums and everybody states well my friend of a friend his brother or his cousin had an excess power and it blew

(Start: 00:06:04)
up but nobody's seen it firsthand nobody's had a friend directly that they worked with in the blue and someone does an interesting tests on one of these forums where they took one of these excess power tubers and they boosted it to the max and they compared it against another tip and they had no issues and a competitor against a cheap eBay knockoff of the excess power so anyway the plan is to just get the car driving running run on a low boost maybe like maximum like 0.8 bar but with a compressor housing and the exhaust housing that saw the cars and spool up really quick and it's gonna give me good low and mid-range here's the story I'm gonna sign off now I'm going to carry on I'm gonna be doing this wolf cam this is pretty boring it's a teardown there are so many videos on youtube you can go check out like how's the tick etc he's done tear downs there's tons of people who doesn't it out I wonder who he goes with us it's the same ship however when I get my parks oh I've got a HKS EBC another one arriving next week so that's cool when I get my pots I'll be filling them and showing you guys like for example and be my battery relocation I'll do that for you guys I'm not gonna

(Start: 00:07:05)
show you the teardown whoo before I go here's the little down pop section that goes on the back of favor and this is a V been seen a V been before there's a look on the turbo here and there's a look on this side of the dam pop and the band itself has got like these little plates and solder that will kind of lock them together very cool quick and easy to get it out and yeah that's it so I'm gonna Memphis and put this little down pop section tiny little thing on looks like a three-inch and then I'm gonna get this off to an exhaust place I can weld it together once it's on the car and then obviously I'll bring it back and do the rest of the build I'm nervous I'm excited I'm doing all of this myself which is pretty scary because I don't have that much mechanical knowledge but I'm learning and the best way to learn is on the job and I'm not afraid to

(Start: 00:08:08)
screw it up I'm nervous though but I'm not afraid so do screw it up I'll pay the price okay guys that's a sorry for the ramble but we'll get this corner right over these days mr2 sw20 my black one been pulling off a whole bunch of parts but in getting them resprayed so the cause and start looking what do you guys call it mint so we're still looking mental little over the  you guys call it anyway gasps that's it for me thank you so much I'll see y'all the next video just bye

Title: F.ck the FD!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYxn5YGzuYs

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys and welcome to the vlog it is day two of working on this piece of our exhibit I'm having such a battle here I'm actually a little bit despondent so I battle to get this heat shield off which sucks someone on here and I figured it out but watching house it takes videos that on a right hand drive if T the steering rack is in the way so you can't exactly pull the heat shield off and you mentioned that he had rusty pieces and when he under the bolts things broke and fell apart and I'm not that lucky Mons completely intact every single bolt I've actually been barely using this cute Winnie that penetrating oil to do anything I've been hitting the bolts just one guy they've all been opening up which is pretty cool so the cars relatively rust free but it's getting rather difficult to get some pieces off and it will heat seal I could probably Dremel it up but I don't have the cutting tools here with me and as they - you know I kind of forgot

(Start: 00:01:02)
to buy as well so I've started doing a couple things one I've pulled out the air pump completely the belt for the air pump is this one over here and I'm busy pulling out the [ __ ] hop right now so once the [ __ ] hop is out I should have some more space to get in and under here but it means I'm gonna pull this tip Inlet thingy that needs to come out and I believe there's bolts that you can get up from the underside and then a couple other bolts I need to take off these two here and then there's another two on that side and some warehouse and then hopefully when that's out I can remove the down pop put that HKS one in and start building everything actually before I finish and put everything back together I'm thinking about changing all these vacuum lines I know up in me I'm getting purple so I can do this whole color theme thing but how much to settle on black and just buy it and get over and done with so this is not exactly going to be a DIY video where I'm gonna be working on the car I'll check in step

(Start: 00:02:03)
by step every now and again show you guys what I've done and go from there purely because this is a new camera I don't want to put it in awkward angles I don't wanna break it the camera is also what it's a Canon EOS m fifty it looks awesome but I can't them think it through when they told me the only other watt model door still one said no said yes I didn't kill the color black one yeah I mean it just means I'm gonna keep this one clean so I'll see you guys in a bit alright cuz I am absolutely [ __ ] finished with this car you cannot believe how much hatred I have for the twin-turbo setup it is so bad and I'll show you why so tough house it takes a bus and I decided to stop stripping the if an ey part but first I need to take off this tear pop which I managed to undo all the nuts at the bottom and there's a stupid silver pop that runs along the firewall that's blocking this

(Start: 00:03:04)
thing it's probably about this much space that I can actually move it back and it's not enough it's not coming off the studs I don't know what to do I won't get that [ __ ] heat shield off at all it's just moving backwards and forwards backwards and forth there's a heat shield underneath there that's blocking the actual heat shield that I want to take off for the down part the bolts or the nuts for the down pop I like this first to each other.they so hard to get to everything is just one big [ __ ] up so I know I don't [ __ ] over this car I think I've come to the conclusion that everybody else does it every rx-7 owner that I know and then I've seen online that modifies gets you stupid twin turbos out and they go big single I think it's time for me to reconsider what I want to do obviously a lot of house renovations and stuff still on the guy so finances are not so great

(Start: 00:04:06)
also been obviously making a little war chest for the Honda NSX but that might have to go down the drain for a little bit or be put on hold and maybe I'll sort this [ __ ] out man I'm gonna favorite told you guys but my plan was don't modify these cars to such a crazy extent because I need to save money to buy a Honda in x6 to buy Mitsubishi 3000gt or GTI to buy tea and a cigarette to buy buy buy buy buy before they get way too expensive because of the draconian laws in America and yeah 25-year rule and all that [ __ ] so I wanted robots many of these JDM cars and then make plans I can't believe this what stock I'm gonna modify the GTR single saber I'm gonna do this one I have to reconsider what I'm doing and perhaps sort this [ __ ] out I got a lot

(Start: 00:05:10)
of thinking to do I'm only in the vlog here you guys give me some advice it's super costly but I probably have to do it I'm thinking maybe just go cheap spend the money on the manifold spend the money on the turbo and for a little bit just use I don't know I don't know I was gonna say stock in Turkey Lebanon it's a piece of [ __ ] I don't know later I'm gonna think about it I will address you guys again in the near future and then terminus car can suddenly garage and rot for all I care Gus thank you so much see you next video bye

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys and welcome to the vlog I'm scared I'm actually very scared of about what's about to happen I'm gonna take my FD into the garage I'm gonna move this thing out and I'm gonna bring my FD in here for a couple of days and I'm gonna strip pretty much everything that I can off the top of the engine bay and I want to get the heat shields off and essentially trying to get that first tier to work because I am so sure after all the troubleshooting that I've done that the wastegate actuator arms on issue or at least the one on the primary server and my feeling is that these surf club has fallen off or broken all fours and put on correctly and the rod is now not like paint whizzing and which means the flap of the wastegate is staying open and I'm losing this my feeling is that because when I Drive the car it is put some boosters I'm getting between point 1 point 2 bar boost come to like 1.8 PSRs I mean it's

(Start: 00:01:03)
really nothing but it's enough to allow the electrical motors cool but there's some sort of a flap that if it picks up boost then it allows the second term as clickin completely forgotten but there's enough boost to generate generator boost - I hope enough left a lot of signature it's work so I'm not feeling is that the first ever does work and I've check vacuum I zone of the uim and behind and all over the place and let me vacuum over so I couldn't see when the ones going to the wastegate actuator so it could be there or like I said it could be the Year odd but we're about funner and while we're doing that just about me somewhere there dump up I want to do the down part I need to do the dump but I'm nervous I haven't done this sort of work in a very long time waking the house okay he's just civil stuff right now but it's tough get out of my comfort it again bad boy [Music]

(Start: 00:02:21)
let us realize that the one lockers up in the gt-r Lucky's cool led things in this little control unit Shelby's and savage come see don't did that sucks put them for another day here's the plan I want to take all this crap off so strut brace is gonna come off this popping for the intake is gonna come off obviously the intakes in I come off whatever else does here that could potentially be in the way there's a heat shield somewhere at the bottom here and that's covering the wastegate actuators yeah I can actually see the one way educated okay look at that I can see an X right over there there for you guys can they that thing I got my plan is to get in and around there but the rod itself is covered by heat shields and you take a little crap off and then you take all the junk that's around here so I've got some easy access from the top so I can put that HKS dump up let's go

(Start: 00:03:23)
[Music] [Applause] I'll take a look at how much more visibility I have you see the intakes I never showed you guys are pulling the paper all the radiator pops but I realize that then we can see it whenever little petal is where I've totally forgot to push record I just pull this whole thing up figured out do it from the top and there was one piece there was one fault over here I was holding it and boom and up so immediately I can see the wastegate actuator one of them I don't know which one matter but there's a heat shield and I'm assuming that Fulani it cycle so you get all this other crap Oh first damn yes feels like I've been through the wars here I've been off camp for about an hour and a

(Start: 00:04:24)
half I'm completely black up raise the car up and I actually haven't gotten too much I've been fighting with these two little bolts so they at the bottom that's the oxygen sensor on the down pup and gotta focus here but every day there was a map that I had to take up actually just anita's pop and then there was a bolt that took whatever took about an hour just to get that belt off there's literally much space to work on this car I tried all my tools I couldn't get two wretched sparrows the wicks oh man yeah well raise the car up that was the second-to-last bolt now there's two underneath the car that I'm going to be taking out I'm not gonna bother filming I don't I get the camera duty at I want to damage the camera I'll tell you guys what's happening afterwards man I've been battling but underneath the car for probably would last hour and a half in the top and I've been planning to get this damn heat shield off there's a heat

(Start: 00:05:24)
shield just above the oxygen sensor I've got the bolts out but I just can't seem to wiggle it around and get it out having a quick read on the forums in there they they say it's more difficult on a JDM car but you can pull it out from the bottom I've been trying and failing so I'm going to give us a batch again in the morning or maybe following day I don't know I do have some bad news while I was under the I managed to take some other heat shields off which allowed me access to the wastegate arms and both of them have got the sick lips on it and by their more intact I don't know why I'm not producing boost I really don't know all my vacuum leads that I care as far as I can see I don't know I've changed up my chart relief elf of I swapped out some other valve a bypass valve or something I swapped through the black car when I did the intakes a while ago that didn't solve it

(Start: 00:06:27)
today was getting bitched I'm doing point 1 to point 2 bar depending on the lid I've checked my vacuum reservoir tank reservoir tank and no leaks flipped it on the water pumped me throughout my bowels I don't I do yes but I'm still gonna do this down pop story just not today so that's the vlog have mom seriously out of my comfort zone like big time I've only need to call them hands on super hands-on look at me I don't know go I don't feel like talking to the camera right now so guys thank you so much for watching try make the next one a bit better we'll see you all next time Cheers

(Start: 00:00:00)
to boost up a little bit more what is up guys and welcome to the vlog this is actually the second time I'm filming this video yesterday there was just a more in the hell of a comedy of errors so what I did yesterday was I actually ended up fitting the electronic boost controller and well everything when I care besides the fact that the battery is completely dead on this clock I mean I couldn't even get a charge record have been on charge for a couple days and just not working at all ever I'd swapped out the solenoid I've got a little filter on there now which is awesome here's the old one and there's the old boost controller and that will display for the base controller I found a pack of JDM cigarettes or Japanese cigarettes these were inside the Oryx even underneath the seat and was about to begin saw their 101 yen and there were some slips in there for 7,500 japanese yen for 50.1 litres of fuel and it's kind of

(Start: 00:01:03)
like worn out so I can see that the date was anyway most of stuff was done the mission yesterday was obviously the battery story and I thought about taking the one out of the FD and if T's been probably my most reliable car as of late other than the Juke obviously but the no answer say if these batteries pulled out the battery from the mr2 and well that's in the GTR now so here's the Vorta battery that was in the GTR and that one's completely cooked it's about five years old star implement and here's what I did check this up I'll sickos that look okay so this display landed up coming with an apex II holder thingy which is quite nice I like it there's my power of C display or controller commando or whatever II caught there's my base controller thing

teratoma and V sketch so I'm going to be setting up a GoPro it's going to be going over there I've set up the microphone already taped up there and we gotta go for drug okay guys here's the plan so I'm on the right now to see if put some fuel then I'm just gonna throw in about 20 meters and then I'm gonna get on the highway and I'm going to do a wide-open throttle hopefully they'll give me some values on yeah I see oppressors

(Start: 00:03:08)
microphone injustice [Music] how much she does going to see or hear rear seats and upon the Bekaa strips us it's pretty noisy when I'm driving it but if you guys can see here there's this moving number which is currently sitting fifties there teaser on there negative that's showing what my current beast is and just above it it's got an on video now on is how much beasts the car hit and I waited to post a few spinasse coming out of the garage on tip yes that's like point zero zero zero zero

something's on Racha are keeping these little electrical shorts as I'm driving and cuts power and the stuff gentle for a split second and then it's back on again so I'm just a little bit nervous I don't know I think this battery might be a little bit too small for this car but I'm down the boost up a little bit more we got a little hood

yeah something's up I think one of our pops maybe shut off the solenoid alright sorted out my booze cups came off off-camera tell them just under one ball it's going recur getting these electrical surges back so there'd be something up you guys can hear all the crackle and pops community since I've put in the say pixie piracy justice

race each other we went on that stretch we just came from and the if dear aunt two colleagues pretty much every year all 32 barebone or theses recent kernels completely dead sub but I mean just to see the difference between the two cars I think this would have definitely caught up with AFD top-end but it was a super sluggish because it was missing huge sensation it wasn't me flash run I mean let's say the school of the corner hot links depending on what rolling speed we did the lower rolling speed raters media Christine found a Carter car and she's sorry I'm betting

(Start: 00:13:41)
and anything higher dog or exhibit would talk to colleagues on this wall impressive which means that this ball would have been about a hundred and eighty no that's funny Sarah at the time on 0.5 fall feast because rx-7 of 206 bicycle depicts entirety and intake so it's 115 plus bonus yeah so this was running about 180 okay guys I'm going to end the vlog here so I achieved I managed to get one bar lying 0.9 ba-caw felt good obviously not as strong as it used to be still need to play with the offset so I can make it more Chris the way the base would come in it needs to be home in your face

(Start: 00:14:43)
now that'll do another day at least now I'm gonna set to one bar keep saying one while do let's call one more I'm going to say to me I wanted and that's on the be volume I go back to the table if a number say that would probably exist and 1.14 and then Bob is either the gain and opposite in everything since it's more implicit he should have seen a car run for a little bit strongest guys thanks so much next video I'm gonna be working the rx-7 I'm going to be moving the same atomic force instead and then I wanna start getting the carbon stance and start preparing should be the down part that's going to be interesting and once I've got the GTR set up properly I want to do another race versus the or exhibit with its down Park and then see what

(Start: 00:15:45)
happens because both then we'll be able to stop a big steep RFC maps the base maps are there and it's kind of like even playing field in terms of tuning but obviously modifications the GTRs guys that's it for the blog some exciting stuff to come I'm back good to be back thank you so much for the comments really a pretty sure I'll see what you do thing stuff just

what is up Gazan welcome to the vlog it's been a very very long time I think about three months it's actually picked up a camera and started speaking to you guys and I humbly apologize for that it's it's just been crazy and I've been trying to focus on the laughs on myself my family on the cause I know that sounds funny because I'm gonna carve vlogging what's made of Channel but it's difficult having to worry about camera angles and filming and editing and all that stuff when you're trying to either work on the car and it kind of takes a whole element of getting the job done doing it properly and quickly that all goes out the window any logging and trying to do DIY stuff sure a lot of you guys know I mean I see guys with vloggers and a lot of you guys are bloggers it's difficult so I've just taken a time off for myself and then that time will form a sh t right a bit of stuff there here's aft I'll thought unless there's been a couple minor things on the go one it's fully licensed and registered which is amazing I can

(Start: 00:01:00)
drive it any single time I went and just excuse the car being so damn dirty because been raining the or magic holders in so that looks awesome it's like a vm top look there's the engine bay not too much has gone down here I've got the super power flow intakes and I picked up these purple pretty call them filters from rotten drivers Japan so thankful for them because I'm we're just get any parts like within three days i'm using DHL Express which is a mark two is just in front d as you can see but nothing's happened I haven't painted yet yeah it's just been forgotten in the corner still drop it every now and again but yeah GTR is on life support right now excuse the mess like I said it's been raining and super dirty boot right now but I had to put in a bigger fuse because I had these funny surges and I had to redo some of my cabling but all good it's just on charger out now I need a Barney battery this battery is from 2013 but it's been holding outfits gives

(Start: 00:02:02)
me about a week and a half but I'll change that pretty soon what else have we got yeah oh yeah so I don't know if you guys noticed but the camera quality is a hell of a lot better because I'm on a new camera so I am on a Canon m50 usm 50 but let me show you something cool and I'm gonna let pass Nelson just take it away enjoy thanks future Nelson as you can see I'm out right now we busy testing out on new camera this is the EOS m 50 it's pretty awesome it's actually got a flip screen so I'm looking at myself which is cool I wasn't able to do this before and you can see what's in the background the FD and Gareth so he's come along with me because we are taking from photos random photos outside out in the Boundary Kearney and I'm just London UT on st. it and we felt something epic and I want to show you dudes check this out so in front of me there are bunch of Honda s2000 we had a place called Auto

(Start: 00:03:03)
DNA so we'll sort of the crêpes that there's some really old shaved thing here and then there's five is 2000 just parked here doing nothing this looks like a profitable showroom and there is a little cafe there we can grab some food to eat and look what I found this is actually why we stopped mister - mister cheese brother a red brother and it looks like it is completely stock standard so I'm pretty stoked that we stopped here that that's actually cool - see that's the any other MRT that I've ever seen before and Darren's messing around he's got his big 6d 6d camera those things awesome I mean those m50 is pretty cool it's a mirrorless camera with flip screen as awesome for vlogging but yeah I mean nothing compared to that 16 so check us out I'm going around the back here and here's the back of this little display place they're all soft tops and they each got its own little perks this

(Start: 00:04:05)
one that's got a I don't know this one looks stuck to me the yellow ones definitely got an exhaustion uh it's more to market runs a more tears there this one looks pretty stuck to me I don't know much about H mm but that's cool I mean there's a there's a place here you can come and eat just cool some hot travel stuff we just happened to stumble upon those who stopped and I figured I get it on the floor so anyway that's it for from me let's get back to future Nelson if it was so cool I mean that was really unexpected myself and Gary now we saw is 2000s we saw that MRT which was nice red looks very much keener than mine completely stuck very very cool stuff so something yours don't know about is I got a new toy for the 32 what could it be what could it be everything looks the same here still do my TV see it's still broken I got some news on that there look what I got I got an apex EEP RFC for the r32 with the hand controller awesome stuff

(Start: 00:05:05)
never done anything on earth there was a map when they're ready from the r33 GTR I pulled it off made a copy it's running on the base map but the base map is better on the apex II it's more updated one timing tables are slightly better slightly leaner which is not acid but you guys remember this car had a boosting issue and the problem was with Mark whose control solenoid on the HKS EBC I remember a while ago a couple months ago showed you issues with the ABC CBC solenoid or an issue of the controller inside but then I'll narrow that down to the EVC and I'm pretty sure that I'm the dumbass that screwed it up because I never end filters on the pop were you supposed to put filters and they stopped gunk from going into the solenoid and seizing it up but look how cool that was now I know that the engine bays in the background where I'm shooting I'm so blessed to have this camera enough so the big news on the r32 is obviously the pixie power of see also the booster has been broken but I found a place called from Japan very

(Start: 00:06:07)
cause an auction proxy service and I'm just buying a ton of stuff I've been funding turbo Thomas super cheap I learned that up buying a lot of them over ten I don't know why I just randomly started buying Tim Burton memorabilia Initial D stuff there's been going crazy buying stuff and one of the things that I was looking for as a solenoid for the HK CBC and I couldn't find one I tried and tried and tried I've been trying I bet eventually I just got upset and I'll ended up buying the entire boost controller system HKS CB c 5 so that's gonna come in a couple of days and what I'm gonna do is I'll take you guys with me are we gonna sit up the EBC get the core boosting into one point something boy they don't even do some maintenance I haven't done it yet I have our boot on mates and some rx-7 actually both rx Evans and more twos done bunch of stuffs been done but I'll just forget about it like that and you guys can pause it here and see what's done and not a lot of the list has been done like I said I've been focusing on

(Start: 00:07:07)
the house but at least there's a pair of C in the car and I'm gonna have boost against shortly that's pretty much it in terms of car parts and what's been getting up still go down pop to fill in the rx-7 there's still a lot of stuff that needs to happen but yeah tom is an issue but I'm starting to back into it and vlogging is gonna give me the motivation to start doing it again I've been lazy anyway I'm back on track now I'm vlogging if it's gonna take me time so be it I'm not gonna tell you guys when we and I'm gonna post next let's see this see what happens but I've got one more thing to show you guys give me a sec hey boy sorry singing little vlog this is Rocco he is 16 weeks old yesterday he's a German Shepherd puppy we got him at 8 weeks he was sorry we got him at 7 weeks he was tiny he probably came home a little bit too early but we were people he good to get rid of him too but pretty awesome dog this is gonna get hella big porcelain

(Start: 00:09:08)

(Start: 00:04:04)

(Start: 00:07:09)
way the paperwork for the car next week paperwork's ready it's been approved I'm not just gonna do one more see are so annoying I'd only lost 60 days and it took so long to do the Interpol clearance and clearance Allah or getting the car load on the system you're not gonna go back and do another cor they will give it to me in the back straightaway while I'm there and then drop the law since the department go pick up my new licensing documents and then go get plates major then I'm done so the next week if we've got some time at work if not in the following week but either way it's registered done sorted I'm so happy that music and drugs are except and whenever one and the biggest thing it means that I can flip the down pop and I can fit the Intex and purple plumbing and gauges and stuff so now it's somewhat a fight in the cause I don't need to worry about expections and all that did somebody in the vlog here there was that letter my update video whatever the hell you're gonna cord lock comment subscribe whatever ton

(Start: 00:00:00)
what is up gasps happy new years welcome to 2018 this is Nell Cal JDM vlogs I am inside my mr2 if you haven't guessed ready actually have guess because I just showed an intro of the exhausting so I'm going to wait a little while a bit a bit sick and just really haven't felt like picking up the camera it's all no nothing special about this video I just decided to get on the car and just start filming and maybe we'll just take the GT off a little drama as well let's see how it goes what the mark first set up over here flipping the Sounders again yeah I've been posting on a different platform I've been writing blog so it's

(Start: 00:01:01)
not really video content if you guys are interested links in the description you get paid to blog anyone can do it it's pretty cool couple of creators already on the that downshift channel cada GTR she Sam will drive he's got a 3-2 skyline quite a few guys are probably missing for ya speed demon Pro he's another one he's got r32 GTR so quite a few of us from YouTube are deporting across there and we're posting different content or we usually put in person YouTube and crops posting as well anyway Hey look there's my old Juke the guy saw that I saw that far in 2015 in the 2015 those my first listen G so one exciting thing is that should have the licensing ready for the rx-7 the silver FD probably ready in about two weeks plus - that means the carbon rod legal I could

(Start: 00:02:03)
drive it if I want to and I can start modify because I've been putting the modifications on whole just in case police want to do inspections and all that sort of stuff you never know they might complain about something but you all know I've got a whole host of months ago down top of an intake I got all sorts of stuff and I got that a big steep fc3 on the course I rest are cheating and I'm looking for if your deeds made it thus far in this boring vlog what do you guys think of an eagle talon or a Mitsubishi Eclipse so there's one for sale it's not so far away from me it's relatively cheap and it's pretty rare there's only three Eagle telling since Africa it's a left hand drive course so you guys will be you still if you live in the States it's the TSI version I think so it's all-wheel drive in this turbocharged think it's got the same engine as the

(Start: 00:03:04)
Mitsubishi Evo what are you guys thinking that car I don't know just I saw it it's not so much of an impulse buyers like this I mean I saw the advert the same day I bought the car the same day it's a sovereign online I've never seen one in real life and a Paul Walker had one you had the green one in first fast and furious Mitsubishi Eclipse I don't know I don't know too much about the car they were never allowed in Africa these were imported somehow probably through a delegate or something but they're not on our collectors Artemis that you've referred to you if the coastal available officers logs up and you guys say decent buyers I mean I don't know maybe I'll consider it I just don't want it to be a [ __ ] box in our lock selling him but I do have pants and obviously my ultimate goal I don't know if I've spoken to you guys about this but I'm on the ground now why do I

(Start: 00:04:05)
have all these cause because one I love JDM cause I love Japanese cause I had my first taste with the JDM father r32 GTR and I'd never want to go back to let's say an older Subaru etc as much as I loved Seabreeze there were cool cars but these JD and piece of there's so much fun I mean this one for example it was so slow but I'll often are small when I'm driving this car I don't know why I haven't figured it out yet so that's the one thing the second thing is obviously Internet's been making this cause really famous there's a draconian law in the United States where you guys can import them off to 25 years so if the past 25 years although you can bring them into the state which means in two years time you'll be able to get r33 GTR s etc no that's making a lot of cause more famous instead famous i've started picking these cars up before they get super expensive and i don't want to spend ridiculous amounts of money on

(Start: 00:05:07)
these sort of caught I'll be honest with you guys I am looking at extending my collection and there are a couple ones that I'd like to get so one is I receive the Mitsubishi GTO that's the VR for to enter Bo I've heard some insight infer that it might come on to the collectors arts and bust in the next month or two now I'll say this list with inverted commas it's a long story if you're not a African you already care it might become available in the next two months or so and if it does they're pretty cheap they four-wheel-drive or oil drive they three litre twin turbos they're quite heavy but they're decent but they're pretty cool it's one of those like underrated JDM muscle cause I don't know thinking about getting one so that's one that's on the cheap in and then the second thing is I might be looking at getting a Honda NSX

(Start: 00:06:08)
and it's it's not a joke I'm really thinking about it they are really expensive I'm looking at the starting price the auctions about twenty five thousand and that's for real bottom of the range not a junker but just something that I probably wouldn't really enjoy it's probably gonna be an automatic as well for it to go for that price range so maybe not dead low but they go up to about ninety five thousand dollars plus - I don't know how I need to play around the auctions and see what I can be and how much money I can actually throw at it I'm seriously considering in NSX so in front of me is I'm sure lunga this is like the happening tourist area [Music] pretty much everyone who goes on holiday in South Africa they come here and it's absolutely turmoil right now there's no parking anyway there's people walking

(Start: 00:07:09)
around and Beach guys holiday guys all that stuff so I'm not gonna go right into there a lot of cops it - I don't feel like getting pulled on let's go on the freeway I'll do one or two let's go 2nd gear 3000 rpm 6,000 I was a funny car I've had fun on the aspirin pieces it's pretty impressive because it's so loud it's like 160 horsepower say 120 you want to come hordes it's really nothing to write home about but I don't know if

(Start: 00:08:11)
you guys to see my speeder but I'm sitting 90 cares now just over 3,000 rpm fourth gear no lag no turbos ten hundred twenty not bad I got a hold in the captain Etta convinced on the back I don't off-camera pulled put the corn ramps and started rappin yeah I can actually feel like a leak coming from the cat not a big deal you get a sort of that problem is time damn house that I'm still busy laws that have so much more time on my hands it's gonna get fourth gear

(Start: 00:09:17)
you guys think I'm losing out a little bit of power with this econ the cat so as far as I remember with a normally aspirated car you kind of need some back pressure otherwise you lose power I think I don't know I just thought I need a sorta stuff cuz I hate the fact that it sounds like a modified co2 conquest of Toyota Corolla and that's probably one of my biggest effect is deciding factors if I had to go for any engine let me go saying I'll go for the beans might uh I don't think I'd ever go through so we have some [ __ ] oh they gonna have to go through the three Sgt and here I'm almost back home I'm gonna take the gt-r for a spin see how that falls guy so Levin sold out that base controller probably to buy a new one

(Start: 00:10:18)
is what it is so right now I'm just rocking 0.5 ball [Applause] she's probably about 170 yards which is crap [Music] okay guys that was a for the vlog to some random meet I'm just getting used to my cars driving my car took on loaders from the drum

(Start: 00:11:19)
just make it into the garage there it goes I'm going to end the vlog here as a Down pulpitis wrapped this is fiberglass wrap con retains all the heat I haven't finished doing us these are temporary and siesta loose that's Tiffany not supposed to be on there so I'm gonna need to know if these two a permanent those have done that one has done I've just won Totten these two for some reason I need to fix one of them and then take that thing off dudes that said give me about a week or two I'm gonna plug it back my feed a few cars wanna follow me on steam it go ahead I first see every single day some cool stuff lots and lots and lots of JT I'm content than a posting on there just easier for me to do that having to pick up the camera girls thank you so much [Music]

probably why i'm a little bit sick now but uh so the plan now is i want to go and start crossing stuff off that list and one of the things is there's a slight oil leak on the black rx-7 i want to bring it across here and diagnose see what the issue is hopefully try and fix it quite quickly but i don't feel like driving the duke so i'm either gonna drive that or what's in the garage i'm gonna leave this one up to fate uh we're gonna do a coin toss but before we go into that guys i just wanna give a little shout out to another youtuber his name on here is friend built he's been on the ground for a very long time he's also got an r32 gtr he does a lot of vlogging he sees some pretty cool car and he's like an avid jdm fanatic yeah anyway go check out his channel he does a lot of vlogging um friend built so let's leave it up for the old marty coin here's the gtr tails this is this thing either way [Music]

(Start: 00:02:37)
i forget how much fun it is to drive an r32 gtr it doesn't absolutely i'm still lacking boost i've disconnected this whole display from the evc and i know if you guys remember but this car can't go over 0.5 bar boost and if i switch this off then it goes to 1.5 list so i'm just trying to something out i figured let me remove the display because that kind of adds in like extra features and yeah well it's not working just look at that boost so it's either the control unit or the solenoid in the front is an issue but it's still so much fun at 0.5 bar

(Start: 00:04:19)
so this caught inspires pretty much no confidence around these corners i just went around these bins at about 65-ish 60 and yeah because of the automatic and i don't know what else but it just doesn't feel right if i had compared to the silver rx-7 the mr2 the r32 gtr it just feels a lot more unsafe i'm pretty much lost for words i don't have to explain to you guys but it feels sloppy around the world maybe it's a combo of the shitty ties that are on them this one's at the soft suspension because it is that touring x model which is supposed to be like the luxury version um so yeah it feels here

(Start: 00:05:24)
there we go uh still such a good looking car especially in black i wish the water was a silver and this one was the manual but uh oh looks cool both black ones together actually took this one out for a drive yesterday so i'm kind of glad the coin toss landed in favor of the gtr i just wish i had a road permit for the silver rx-7 then i could have at least like driven all my cars together last time for 2017. [Applause]

(Start: 00:06:30)
oh by the way i don't know i mentioned to anyone merry christmas and uh but i'll see you guys have a happy new year oh that was easy found the leak it's coming from the sump plug washer that was super easy and maybe a little bit embarrassing but uh some plug wasn't exactly tight i mean i wasn't like i wasn't able to undo it with my fingers but it just wasn't that tight a pretty school boy here on my part anyway i've just tightened it up now i've checked the oil levels they're still pretty hot because i've been topping it up oh the car is good that's one more thing scratch off the list i know this is like menial [ __ ] that i'm busy doing guys but hell i am tired i'm sick i've worked 18 weekends in a row i just want a break

(Start: 00:07:30)
that's not a mr2 that's a black ifd fix oil leak yay if you dudes missed out a video skipped a video or something i've got the 76mm hks down part for the silver rx-7fd i've also got somewhere here apexe super power flow i don't know what the hell they're called intakes i don't know if i'm going to throw them on the rx7 because i didn't realize that these little pieces were chopped off and welded up so but remember i do have something on this black one i've got these hk's intakes so maybe just maybe it'll be easier if i just take the intakes of this car throw it on the silver one and then put this down part in the silver line and then move all the stock bits onto the black one remember i want to make this black one completely stock oh something cool i've ordered one of those big wings for the rx-7 for the fd is this dammit the silver rx-7 keep forgetting of it too

(Start: 00:08:31)
remember this card used to have the veil side wearing on it i didn't particularly like it neither some of you some of you guys did some of you guys didn't i don't really like it so i ripped it off i've been running my wing which kind of sucks so i'm taking the wing off the silver fd i'm going to spray black color coated match geez i can't talk today i'm going to color match it to this car obviously there's different shades of black and then i've got that big wing that's going to be coming for the silver one cool it should be on about a month i live in the jungle so everything takes forever to get you then i've got some cool stuff a little apexed service armor this is an old-school one from the 90s and then i've got the very first apexi airflow converter so now this thing you set it up and it kind of tricks the ecu into thinking that it's getting different voltages for the mass airflow sensor so it works on like a zero to five volt basis and for each point one it kind of like means something so the ecu will know that

(Start: 00:09:32)
let's say for the sake of this discussion 4.1 volts equals 260 grams of air flowing into the intake now obviously the ecu knows at 260 i'm going to throw x amount of fuel at this amount of air that's coming in so now what this does is it obviously a lot of cars run rich and it's a stock car so it is going to be safer running rich you wanted to lean it out a little bit get a little bit more performance performance and you're going to be telling this fake readings basically obviously you don't just go on and go wild and like drive it and use your butt as a dino and say okay cool that's feeling good you put it on a wideband so you get an lc2 an lm2 that goes in the back of the exhaust and you do some street shooting and you got a little little bit by little bit so it's got like increments of i think three percent yeah so it's got three percent increments goes all the way to 18 and -21

(Start: 00:10:35)
obviously this is like not best practice for tuning i mean i've got a pixi power fc on the silver fd that is a full standalone ecu uh i was going to say this car but i meant the r32 gtr that i'm more than likely going to be going for a healthtech platinum um just because of the tunability and the scalability on it but for the mr2 if you guys don't know already i'm going to do error-specific modifications so i'm going to be buying stuff that was made in the early 90s and i'm going to be slapping it on the mr2 and it's basically going to be like a time machine for me so i can feel what it was like to drive a modified mr2 sw20 back in the 90s and then i've got some other stuff so i need to heat wrap this car i've also got a heat trap damn it that's not the r32 i got to heat wrap the r32 gtr then i've got some hell better brake hoses these are going to go on the silver fd i've got some more silicon radiator pipe things for the r32 i've got

(Start: 00:11:37)
purple silicon radiator pipes for the silver fd i've got gauges with apexe holders for the silver fd i've got a cam belt that i need to change in the r32 gtr and i've got a whole board that i need to start crossing stuff off so i've got a lot of work to do and the problem is just time because i'm working on the stupid house and i haven't had workers i'm doing things by myself but now is not the time to complain geez i'm finding it hard to breathe while i'm sick and i'm sweating so badly guys i think i'm going to call it a night i'm gonna take some flu meds and have dinner and go sleep it off if you guys enjoyed the vlog give it a like give it a thumbs up and dudes thank you so much for subscribing uh go check out my steemit page you guys might like the content that i'm publishing on there so i'm doing some cool stuff like jdm auctions i'm doing daily picks of cars i did like a rear wheel drive edition told you guys what date the cars are for sale on my opinion on the cars all the pictures the auction sheet what the auction sheet means just some stuff like that and i did an all-wheel drive edition of subaru's and

(Start: 00:12:39)
stuff and today i did a mint edition which is pretty cool honda nsx with like 9 000 kilometers on it i think that's 4 000 miles maybe less maybe like 3 000 miles mint nsx that's gonna go for huge money um and then three other minters that i found um and they're all for sale like tomorrow and the following day so dude that's it for the vlog this is my final vlog for this year guys thank you so much for all the support we've grown back a thousand three hundred subscribers i think so dudes if you're new to the channel i appreciate your support i'm gonna carry on vlogging and i'm gonna try and get more time in my life so i can keep on vlogging okay guys thank you so much i will see you all next time and tuesday is ocean blue 28 sit over you ferrari drop some roller skulls

Title: You need to hear this!

(Start: 00:00:00)
because it's not easy way to say this but last week Oh sigh I've been cheating on you in all seriousness I have joined another platform they hang before you close this video you need to see this something amazing has happened on the last week oh so I've turned the platform called steam it steam F calm I've started a couple years ago it's a social media website that pays you to blog and blog and cryptocurrency it's backed by currency called steam and basically you go on and you post about anything whatever you want does lend imitations I mean you guys can do it too and I'm gonna tell you guys a little bit about what's been going on how much money I've been back making cuz I mean it's transparent as the other day so I thought about making this video and making it scripted and sub down and hey guys okay this is how it's gonna be I'm on this platform this platforms also I thought that's very natural that's not how to talk to you guys I'll talk to you guys like this I already made a couple of serious videos like that common

(Start: 00:01:01)
problems the r32 GTR video that was scripted then I sat down and it took me like on a couple hours to put together the script and then run through it and then I've got a whole bunch of user that's a viral video and it's carrying on building them in some everyday but I thought you guys know me then we just be up front be honest just be casual velvet softly so I started about two years ago social media sought you go on if your blog you post pictures it's kind of like Instagram YouTube Facebook all in one all mesh together they they growing out at every day there's new features being released all the time and then it's generally just cooler so the last thing about if you have any interest in cryptocurrency this is the platform to really look at because not only do you get paid to blog blog etc but you can pay them well to dirt and you help out people think the community and you share the coin that is Steven now for me what I've been doing is I've been going on and trying to build my base and my followers and I mean I'm up to about 70 followers on there nothing like my youtube

(Start: 00:02:02)
subscribers but I'm on there and I'm publishing my videos and I'm publishing older videos so I can get awareness and get up there and then obviously trying to get to current and posting pictures and the first thing different types of content that you guys may enjoy but it's been a ton of fun and now if you look at you are getting paid in steam which is a cryptocurrency right now as I'm talking the value of steam is 11 to 1 US dollar so that's doing ok we're shuffling around 5 6 during the week and then it just boosted up its gonna go back down and I mean smaller solids any cryptocurrency so how you get paid and who pays you the people who pay you other people that have interest in your content so you give something called an upvote or like a lock on YouTube and that up vert is valued and worth something so if you've been on the platform you've been posting for whatever a year or two you're gonna have a lot of something called steam power and that is the amount of power that you

(Start: 00:03:03)
can give a lot going up foot and that will have some monetary weight to it but if you go on for instance one of the big guys that refers them as whales whales are the biggest they have like 150,000 SP or steam power and there's orcas and dolphins and minnows you guys are getting stood a few joiner but a whale will come on you give you one thumbs up and that thumbs up could be worth like 50 to a hundred steam dollars now Tom's up by a living that is crazy so let's say 50 clumsily that's five hundred and fifty US dollars now for me how Tom's about a 13.5 and I've got six seven thousand red which can do a lot I mean that's almost and they pick C power of C C I'm thinking of youtubers or joining this platform like crazy right now David pac-man is just on he's got about four hundred fifty thousand subscribers he is absolutely killing it on the steam platform I myself I'm small I'm still Amina but I've got some

(Start: 00:04:04)
backing and I've been making plus minus about $40 per post roughly now I want you guys to check it out and I want you guys to support me if possible I'm still gonna be focusing on YouTube I'm still gonna be posting on YouTube I'm gonna be however cross posting on steam it now the last thing I'm not just posting videos so I'm doing in between us stuff so as you can see on the screen I'm posting content that you guys wouldn't see before the most embarrassing card ever earned that's a cool I got a whole bunch of cash with that I got she's 15 steam dollars Tom's 11 he comes to the math that's crazy you're getting paid like you can't believe and obviously you don't understand lien sell sell sell you want to go ahead and you want to build up the community share your coin with others lock and stuff when you given up foot or a lock and forgot to mention this before it does not cost you anything nothing at all doesn't come off your base I'm gonna go into this very technical with you guys if you want me to this video is just one to get you Alice amped it's exhausting I want you

(Start: 00:05:07)
to come and follow me if possible you guys really support me come on follow me give me an update doesn't matter how big how small we build momentum we're building spreads it a one more cause I've got my 32 GTR I've got three rx-7 FDS I've got my mr2 I still want a Mitsubishi GTR I wanna tear a supermarket for hunt and I need my unicorn Honda NSX because that's not why I've been posting videos I love talking to girls I love engaging of my audience may call me a sellout and that's why making this impromptu you kind of casual video if you got one more info about it drop me comments we can do Q&A about it I don't know there's a link in description there's a verification process that however it takes a while it takes anywhere between 24 hours plus minus 100 and something else so one day two week so unfortunate thing but it's there to stop BOTS and PR people don't need a good body stuff so if you guys do

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZvHtET3vnY

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the vlog so I managed to work on the MRT this weekend for a little bit but I didn't land up logging the whole thing I had a bunch of workers here they were doing the driveway and rebuilding and digging and doing all sorts of stuff another one I look like a complete idiot holding up the camera I basically just worked on the mr2 for a couple of hours here and there small stuff just trying to get things right let me show you what I've done and what's in store for project mr2 so first of all please excuse the mess we're still building we having to dig up this entire drainage system redo all of the stuff sucks but the draw boys almost finished Musti cool mr2 so first things first I managed to get the radio that's in that's working [Music]

(Start: 00:01:01)
seems like there's any speakers here and then these tweeters are in top and bottom they ask because I'm supposed to be in the back but then up there so I just thought what's ours our past the speakers and get this sorted out next thing about that is the seat used to used to be loose so I actually did film that little piece and this whole plastic section had to come out and it was a screw over here or bolt that wasn't taught yeah so the seat is back to normal steering wheels a bit of a cock-up so you guys remember all of this damage on the steering wheel yeah I made it worse we're now suing off the radio I put a piece of tape on here insulation tape and I'll pull it off that came out just some slightly cleaner conceal its yellow logo I'll polish that up looks a little bit better pretty much does everything just get lost wipe down a little the key

(Start: 00:02:03)
note a little better strut brace needs to be repainted that's gonna come out soon and yeah just looks a little bit healthier than what it used to be if you haven't liked it so I finally got my place which means the cause legal so my name I should drive around whenever no issues what's good my loss and stores and I look like in front now if you look at the bonnet and see I've done a little bit of work on you global standing so what I've got is one of these Frey grams palm Sanders so basically it's the Sanders I'll hold a palm like hood and just go around and do whatever so I'm planning on sorting out this call myself in terms of paintwork and all that like I mentioned I've been learning as learning mechanical stuff and an electronical stuff learning up to tune lots of stuff so I'm just trying to make myself better and a couple things and I'm no expert and we're learning as I go along and I'm trying to teach guys as well what I've picked up what I've met along the way one of the things I've always wanted to do is bodywork that's probably not going to come up the

(Start: 00:03:04)
best but at least they can say that other than I tried and they're not gonna hand it over to a professional so what I'm going to do is I'm going to sand them and prepare to do the body full of where I need to which not a lot to do it's just maybe this section over here and pick us up a couple of small things and then get the car Pramod and then I want to spray it myself so I've got everything but the compressor the gun I'll pick up some TK paint match up the black on the car and then spread over said he did it in a controlled environment so I wondered he'll probably do it at my dad's work he's going to makeshift spray booth that he does for his cars pretty good there he's got experience in spraying and he doesn't down the job he's done himself Espada Triumph Spitfire he's got a couple other cars that he's done himself and they came out looking pretty damn good so I don't want him to do the work for me I wanted to give me some Gardens and show me and then obviously I'm gonna be learning from YouTube so that's one of the things sorting up the bonnet sorting out the entire front end so this needs

(Start: 00:04:05)
to be prepared the entire front needs to be prepared everything needs to be prepared I'm not gonna bore you guys on film with all of that so I might do a lot of this off-camera and just show you guys update but that's it I drove the car yesterday I didn't actually feel the need to pick up a camera at all this weekend especially of guys working here so I drove the car just around the block coastal driving very well I'm pretty happier so these hit lots are still need to realign but otherwise this is all something that I'm going to be and hope I can be proud of my work also the beating I need to sort of just be dance flaking everywhere pull it off repaint it obviously the other thing is I'm waiting for a couple things to rob this bunch of a pixie boots that are coming through I've got it if you'll controlling us there's going to be a Terry Thomas arriving and a couple small things just for me to monitor but essentially what the plans are for the corn I mentioned multiple times is I'm going to be putting this car with non tees of vintage electronics HKS a pixie gritty trust those sort of things

(Start: 00:05:05)
vintage electronics from the early nineties and I want to know what it's like to drive this car back in the nineties modified as an era specific part so whatever I get is going to be here specific parts maybe not wheels and that sort of stuff because it might be a little bit hard and expensive fun but I'm gonna try my best these wheels are going to change that don't you girls worry because that's it for the video just a quick one just to show you guys what I've done more to what I was doing this weekend messing around the car having some one-on-one time with it getting tonight oh yeah you guys are gonna need a boss anything at all spraying preparing that sort of stuff let me know I'm keen I'll have all these guys comments read them out reply back cause I'll be back to speak again I've got another video maybe doing a little bit away from the r32 GTR might be doing some stuff in or x7 let's see what happens guys thank you so much thank you for the support we have now two thousand two hundred and sixty subscribers gals thank you so much for support see you next time Oh almost forgot I managed to get the power antenna to go down yeah

Title: Focus ST Tried To Race My RX7 FD
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFvcUWRb2MY

(Start: 00:00:00)
here we are boys be with rx-7 don't mind a piece of plastic gonna stop the water from going in here's the silver one now this is gonna get weighed right now let's move this guy out of the way [Music] yeah mon-sol a fun fact I can't start this car without two hands I got a hold down this button here and then put my foot on the brake and then turn the heat then occasionally the cost of [Music]

(Start: 00:01:24)
so currently I'm driving around with one's ever and the only tip that Sonia is the second tip which kicks in about four and a half thousand rpm so as it stands I'm sitting about three and a half I put my foot down a little bit of talk but no you're right how about the black or x7 is a lot quicker in the low range than this cause because the first server works from roughly 2,000 rpms just under four and a half thousand and there's a slight lull in power in the second turbo kicks on this one it's just flat lon four and a half thousand bang brutal second turbo kicks and there's much 206 whatever kilowatts but anything prior to that it's a little bit dead its but Donna tells me 130 hundred and forty kilo words children horsepower max damn win that second turbo kicks in awesome stuff I got a lot of cars in front of me so I can show you guys temperatures sitting at 95

(Start: 00:02:25)
which means a selfish thing but traffic let me tell you guys something if you're from South Africa and you wanting to import a car get someone to do it for you because this is a dam not me and having to do twice over jeepers look I'll do it again but I've got the process down now I know what to do when to do it how to do and I'm gonna tackle these proportions in the future like getting the right VIN number stamped with original ones on the Weybridge I have got Eric's luck he's got a 63 Bowl exhaust two and a half inch exhaust some sort of cheap feedback box Betsy turn rod oh he's still he left dude I would have locked you up

(Start: 00:03:27)
interesting to see those car around the twisties versus an STI or WRX stock there's the stock of course all-wheel-drive this is a rear-wheel drive stupid beep a lightweight 50:50 weight distribution they will be a good run just a useless piece of info of now down a hundred and eighty seven kilometers driving in this car since its landed from Japan in South Africa pretty sad but considering our quarterly draw this far out without a mind you have any learn about 5,000 kilometers upon 432 GTR another in the car since late 2013 so we going on to five years warmest five years of learning this car there are 32 GTR again about 5,000 I imported

Title: The Day My Subaru STI Was Impounded
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sDtQ9J646g

(Start: 00:00:00)
oh boy I've got a story to tell you guys so I was busy cleaning up my garage or just getting started on cleaning up and I found me something all the way back from 2008 the bus is an impound notice in 2008 my super II got impounded and it was one crazy nut actually was a crazy for five weeks plus miles so in 2008 there was this group of police officers that got together and they were trying to tackle street racing and they were going by the name of Operation quarter-mile and the the leader or the guy ran this department let's call him inspector Bob just full intensive purposes but inspector Bob he took no [ __ ] whatsoever now I had known about this and I was I was trying to keep away from street racing and all of that at the time

(Start: 00:01:01)
something stopped me from getting together at the Subaru club and everyone else but I just doesn't attend the main drag racing events because I knew these guys were up in full force they were catching these guys they were impounding cars etc etc now just to give you a little bit of context as a subaru club we used to meet everything they're not I believe the gospel do I'm just not really part of it anymore but they we used to meet every Thursday mount and occasionally we would get out on the road and go some fun and I'll just happen to take my plates off but not don't know why but took my plates off we don't accept or I had some fun drove the car blah blah blah the next night made someone calls me says listen let's go Alfa's carts are not cool what car we taking of course we can take the Siri I forget to lots of the plates off completely forgot so we're hitting off a me we pretty innocent now we we weren't planning on drinking we're just going to go a good time and drive the car they show off a little bit you know young street but I mean those 10 years ago we roughly

(Start: 00:02:04)
about to two kilometers but a mile plus - away from from the venue cop saw Special Arts he's behind me freaking out what do we do sub pulled over I thought it would be just quick easy fun it turns out it's inspector Bob with your plates what if both plates off heavy even street racing et cetera then he turns around says we saw you at the street race of all the drag racing and not before the legal ones and I said no it wasn't me and it really wasn't me it must have been another white super II know at the time this was a 2005 sorry 2004 WRX STI jet 20 there was a little bit of work done to it he jumps off the car bunched him jump out these guys are loaded there with guns existed there click on said will you play - what's going on just really going into us both of us mom mom it wasn't a car guy he just didn't care about cause didn't know anything about

(Start: 00:03:04)
cars and then to getting him there pushing me there trying to figure out what the hell's going on so after talking a little bit on the road I could just see these girls didn't want to be reasoned with and they put us in the back of the cop car it was a Golf GTI got in the back of them that they cook car and someone drove my super drove it police station we got up the corn we're talking in the parking lot of the police station we hadn't yet gone and I'm a little bit stretch because they were saying okay well what modifications you've you got and I said oh no I wasn't playing it but stupid I don't know what's on the card cetera they said will tell us tell us does it look satellites my STI they were pretty crude up and he'd be picked up the phone and he knew someone at the Tom who was the manager of a super easy leadership and he phoned him up and he described my car and at the time I was the chairman of the super e Club pretty much anyone that had anything to do a super in the area they

(Start: 00:04:07)
knew I was the goddess grabbed my car and all of a sudden the tone changed he started laughing and thought I could cause maybe let's go hangs up the phone comes back and he says look you knows what's on the car he knows what spots on the car he's spoken to the actually sorry I think he was a dealer principal and he said we know you the chairman of the subaru Club don't play dumb we're gonna lock you up or you take away your car etc done nothing wrong so but they finally realized that my mate pretty much had nothing to do with anything even my car so they kind of let him go and he called us though he was a lawyer at the Tom's during this time they put me in a holding cell pretty scary doesn't charge me anything we now use a chairman of the superior Club we will give you your car back - not if you tell us the whereabouts of every Subaru

(Start: 00:05:07)
club member that has modifications on this car we they love etc obviously people that are known in a part of the club and what days what Tom's does the racing happened and sit up like a traffic pass to myself what I've thought about it for like a second and pretty scary you know how the thoughts going through my head I'll get my car back which is cool but then I'll be writing everybody else up and I'll probably get stabbed by a lot of these guys so I have to tums that this happen I was freaking out I don't know what to do I would think about it for a little bit of a second I figured you know what if I do it I can't call back I can take it home - not everything is forgotten I can keep Ahmad's wants to figure out what what's ahead on the car and everything will be golden then I thought about the other way I'll be renting out my friends the scary thing is if I did I probably would have had 1020 Gaza or one that come off - and kill me obviously telling them what mods they

(Start: 00:06:11)
have and they cause anyway they didn't end up charging me in keeping with also my friend's sister came she was lawyer she talked to them and there was absolutely no they they couldn't hold me for anything however they kicked my car and that's what sucks the most they took my car I actually went with them or we put it in perspective it's a police pound damn scary because there's tons and tons and tons and tons of cars so the scary thing with most of the cars over there they were stolen and now my beloved Subarus getting parked next to and amongst all of these inspector bobby'll ends up rotting out all the stuff while we there and one of the things was vehicle to be inspected for modifications by inspector Bob he's headed to Inspector James condition of release motor vehicle subject to examination by inspector Bob from the accident unit si PS you know he already knew the girl from Seabury manager or the dealer principle obviously he'll deny one month oh my god

(Start: 00:07:13)
it turned out for 12 weeks letter went to pick up my car they phoned me up and said hey Nick that baby car was a horrible four to five weeks I got there and he said to me look you've got to take in takeoff but all you want to know I'm lying to you guys sorry the intake stayed I think it was a parent intake that I had a red one there was a full exhaust it was a Kakuma exhaust 76 meltdown pop all the way through there was an extra boost controller HTS you see this and then there was a bigger than circular I don't remember what make it was I think it's taller than him they just told me the second integral off put the stand and went on and they wouldn't release the car then unless I've got a tow truck because of these illegal modifications and yeah well I fortunately because I knew I was going on Condor after speaking some people I went with full standard exhaust intercooler

(Start: 00:08:15)
in take everything in my car or van got dropped often and luckily header with me how quick you changed out the intercooler hey so today you can drop your corner doesn't deregister the car didn't they like sound like this and step on the wrists there wasn't fun and they charged me a whole four hundred bucks so just looking here I was 23 at the time when this happened so guys that's the Tom that my car got impounded it was hella scary I've got a whole bunch of other stories if you guys ever want to hear them some pretty wild stuff not did have a co accident once major co accident actually the car accident magic has been the only other car except I had forgotten I had a car accident about T three days ago in the listen juke and you're a costal [ __ ] I write off my 2005 WRX yeah that was interesting if you guys want another story plus there were a couple of other ones

(Start: 00:01:00)
out and we are also going to fix the boost gauge because we're not working on the call last time boo sketches at one lot up and all their shoes there but they are probably power here we go that's the story and let's get cracking never pull the door cards off on this car turn on some serious comedy that difficult so generally you start at the door handle I can't nothing on the door handle okay so there's a screw down here there's one at the top one over there and then I'm guessing this just pops up and the screws at the bottom and one screw at the bottom to squeeze the three screws at the bottom okay cool let me see the fourth oh it's crackin man I realize I really need to sort out the last thing in this garage

(Start: 00:02:00)
excuse up at the top here I got some like protective waterproof I sort of do this with the camera off because I realize I've added items but basically what you need to do is you need to pull this little cap thingy because of the day that's for the door handle that must come out this little compartment thing there used to come out and then you start from the bottom and you just stop typing pulling these clips and you start looking up that's pretty much up I've seen you take out the electrical oh that's odd that's up door cards art and there's some interesting speakers in here they are called pail mica never heard of it look at that they're actually Kenwood's see the little mark on the front now one

(Start: 00:03:03)
of the spacer bracket thing was stuck on the car gotta be looks tough jeez okay that was super simple kind of just fell back together like Lego much easier than doing it W Rick so HTR door guess I realize I mean this is a little bit of a failed block yeah I need to move a pocket car little closer this one and I can really open the door and there's people that have popped me in and I don't wanna go Austin's maybe there cause I can move the Juke and then we look back so I'm gonna do one door for now and then it's a little bit too dark so I can't see the boost controller or show you guys in the camera I can see it sorry the boost gauge so I'll just open our oath care then damn there's not much I can do right now because of

(Start: 00:04:04)
anything about an hour and up but I'll have to jack up the car for the downpipe heat crap please problem on you test the car reinstall the rear seats I don't actually know if I want to do that I am very relieved ac removal maybe I can start it up although I need someone to cleanly take off the e gas these two I'm dreading big boys how a pickle is this look now

(Start: 00:01:00)
one of those little square ones and they didn't have stop for some reason to go no place so I put the front for them on Monday cheese I pick up the rear plate but that's that I've got the call out since it's on my name which is cool now I can drive it around whenever and yeah so the only car that's I'll stay it needs to be registered is the silver or exhibit it's still a little bit of a process that's gonna take probably another four to five weeks and then it's done it's on the road I can drive which is cool you gotta be hungry a little white board going yet butter rotting up my plants I've got off at et world changes urgent radiator changes urgent amor to same story need for that our magic holder they change radiator fluid just a couple of things I mean you know since skin the throat and does the plans for the car and obviously there's gonna be videos with everything I'm gonna be moving the head unit from into GTR putting in the MRT so I'm gonna tackle it to that so that's probably like something boring for you guys but I

(Start: 00:02:02)
also want to put these guys so these are the LEDs for these - or cluster and those three gauges in the center when you change those two so currently at stock at screen and old-school green are you changes to red and I want to do that same time as the radius so I'm gonna start fully out the radio now I'm gonna stop dismantling the whole cluster getting it out and hopefully we managed to finish up in okay what are we gonna need a some installation type we're gonna need a Phillips screwdriver and we'll need a small flap okay I'm being Austin see okay the first thing I'm gonna do check out the cigarette ladder goes quickly you gotta pull up this trim here kog'maw needle the getting up he goes

(Start: 00:03:04)
back up if you didn't see there's a spear at the bottom hand as a screw over here that you seen psycho yeah once he done taking out those two screws there is another one just on the yeah the story Kayla needs the radio and makes see the cigarette lots of thingamabob and how that's free everything okay cigarette lots of do you he is connected like that some of these plugs at the fish on either side your clip this one so I just want to got the radio which is gonna be these screws over yeah alright so this is like one whole complete thing

(Start: 00:04:06)
so you gonna take up all these gold screws okay old screws out this is sort of free get up the whole thing come off Oh teams to swim yeah so every foot of this radio kind of typed up the antenna thing Ariel okay so we can take another little shell chassis thing you've seen these supersonic screws or formula right here just something I forgot to say idea when you take your negative terminal of the

(Start: 00:05:08)
battery just tap your brakes once kind of drains a little fella the must will be a little bit of power here somewhere I don't know I'm up technical I'll just hit from someone but I'll do it just in case kind of stripping show them I'll take us apart let's take these screws out just pull it down let's knock the back in working on Mon now looks like a plastics to one you very space like pull it out somehow but that's a cat because it can get enhance these a lot so there's three little lots of it there these little blue things and you just kind of turn them turn them to

(Start: 00:06:10)
the rot and then they'll there we go these are like just luck Stan it is she tossed a lot you just turn it and they pop out okay figured it out so this little blue plastic thing and that's just the cover what you do is gonna pull it out but turning it rot from where you sitting will lift from requ it goes off and then you got this little locked in here that you just push and pull it up up grab your new LED take that Pop's in my good so this panel here is really busted I'm looking we have a wick from the radio that's something that kind of like pull this I'll see you to take this whole he's supposed to take this whole thing out and then this will come with you pushed that back and then

(Start: 00:07:12)
it kind of just comes apart or someone had LEDs in here before and they've been said and break all the clips the way I'm doing this you're not supposed to do okay cool so that's it alright I'm gonna connect the battery on my tester and see if this works okay cool everything's back to normal just try and just on 12 volts Houston Sara cool lots on get one way I'll have the color that's that's pretty cool that's the raid that I want this is this year I'm just switching LEDs around so it's probably got a positive and negative or Hester read this with the standard looks like like a green watt

(Start: 00:08:12)
old-school stuff so this is gonna go rid that was the same color before cool all right so let me unplug the battery this tackle does Connor oh it's pretty easy we back together in a bit let's say 35 minutes 40 minutes probably about 30 minutes for you guys if you're not blogging sitting up cameras and talking and all that stuff it lasted yeah it gets in the way but yeah we done I'm just gonna test again [Music] and we good I watching a YouTube a couple weeks ago and he said well one of the things that he hates about is r32 I don't remember for the GTR but there was my steering wheel adjustment on it and yeah dude its Harding under here so there's a little lever right there pull it down and then there's a longer one just any good allowed to use dangled to go up and down they're not emotional adjustment you can't pull it towards you but you can at least go up and down

(Start: 00:09:14)
because the first price will probably be if I disconnect must angle now again guys they're in mind I've never done this before but common sense would tell me let's get the mouse space so we can actually take our release squeeze over here and let's take out the steering wheel just a hint when you're taking it out just luck at aid center you know when you lock your steering wheel and you have to like wiggle around to get the key to ten lock it in it's into position so that you know exactly where it goes when you want to put it back on you're pretty cool maybe show you one of those removable ones and obvious is take those screws out nowadays the help you're gonna take out these screws over here there's two screws just about this teratoma to squeeze in the right hand side out now you gotta take out the excuse it but

(Start: 00:10:15)
underneath is handle the sexual and tire handle help school say that just kind of drops down she screws there we go okay so those bottom sections not out now I'm assuming you gotta take that screw up and those two and then the whole thing should just come off I usually like research the hell out of these things and because I had a bit of a shitty week it's just been one of those damn things we just walk into the garage and the dirt if you're breaking anything okay before you start pulling and tugging on the stairs a screw on the side underneath the windscreen wiper stalk

(Start: 00:11:16)
thing and then there's another screw on the side hair by the indicator stalk okay once you do similar this you've got to pull this cover off and so you kind of get a little bit of a gap on the side here so you can put your finger in here just give it quite a bit of force it'll hear it click and then on this side you just kind of go to hold and then yeah nothing break just sound like it did oh that's up stop playing out this whole thing very menthe is a bunch of plugs in the back here you want to take another's out first there's three on the side sorry

(Start: 00:12:18)
they off four on the Sun so yeah once this panel is out then there's just two screws at the bottom to the top and that's out okay so that's the back of it [Music] let's see there's a whole bunch of lots on this side I'm just gonna do a quick count I'm changing it [Music] once you finish putting in all the LEDs just plug in the section and then just switch your Lots on and then you can just do it quick test so I'll show you guys when I'm done here I wanna ruin it so I'm gonna put everything back together okay we're almost done so this is all back in just you put the steering wheel back on my electronic boost controller and I'm sorted okay I see a

(Start: 00:13:22)
problem already and knock the power out for those boost gauge somewhere anyway I'll sort that out off cam here's my dish [Music] kind of like a little DIY video I can't really do the camera angle thing I just couldn't be bothered today just get it done so that took two hours 15 minutes with filming and editing and talking and all that so you guys can do an hour and a half if you got a naughty to GTR and you want to change your Lots so that's something to cross off this list [Music] please pause the video I have a quick look tell me in the comment section what you guys would like to see next maybe I'll do it that way you guys let me know let's see who gets the most the most comments for something so you guys

what's up guys and welcome to the vlog today we're gonna go check out what's wrong with my rx-7 basically I took it out yesterday I decided not to film anything I took it out no internet my certificate of roadworthy called past hundred percent no issues at all no breaking issues I've got a pretty mentor exhibit so I'm stoked about that however I got back home dropped it off and I got a phone call a couple of hours later saying this water in the garage there's water everywhere around the car so I forgot to check it out yet we're gonna go often now have a look make sure they're examines okay probably the damage is T again unimaginable I don't know why I'm going into the car and all I want to do is just get this car right worried and licensed under my name and then I can stock modify and I'll probably delete it or I'll get in Elementium one when lol winding else call it but yeah that's the story so we gotta shoot off quickly and misc assorted stuff

(Start: 00:01:07)
[Music] which should take you guys for a drive in this car been a long time since I've actually driven a puppet so apparently the whole of the water all over the floor my gut feel is AST let's see you know probably about coolant okay [Music] okay what happened [Music] see anything wrong unless a HT that we saw that he taught me put these two

(Start: 00:02:10)
plates that we clamped together with these grab screws and then inside has just a bunch of silicon and then all the all the nozzles those all change there's a little copper nozzles now a brass nozzle rather so deafening out the ast it's not bitching about any fluids or missing coolant the water that's on the floor is actually just water it's kind of an air conditioning see what's going on the coolant yeah yes does not make sense we still got coolant yeah I'm not coolant splash back or anything so you know what I'm gonna reel it down to your AC just dripping with

(Start: 00:03:13)
blistering hot yesterday went away another of the AC pumping PC works very well guess it was just that it started up in Suez can and if you can see previous history on us okay that was quite a scary sound [Music]

(Start: 00:04:13)
doing some water on the belts in the belt or colored duct when I walk across you good felt guilty leaving a book to do this now it just kind of go together and I can hear like belt fluid like water being on it let me dip t help happen I don't know what that but the water that's on the floor is just plain water my AC story

(Start: 00:05:38)
she goes I don't know what to say that was very strange so the concept ain't even water however those water on the floor a lot of water on the floor it doesn't have any green good into them so where did I come from what's the other fight tanks when you scream water I made this mistake before they closed the bonnet before put the windscreen wipers on I've no idea what just wind up anyway the cross seems fun I'm gonna drive it for probably another month or so until it's fully registered and I'm gonna bring it home so we were worried about it then I've got a little bit of time I might as well grab this black thing around quickly I know she is I don't know my GoPro with me let's see if I can mount this camera somewhere for you did

(Start: 00:06:55)
so this car is officially road-legal 100% library this cause 100% road-legal I can drop it wherever I want way no one which is pretty cool however just kind of like time so the plans for this car is to go back to standard so I'm gonna move all the standard stuff that's on the type of Ras silver exhibit we're gonna move it across to this car the saris stuff being the intake and the exhaust we'll move that across then take an exhaust that's on here I'm not too sure what I'm going to do with but yeah [Music]

(Start: 00:08:18)
it's actually pretty quick fully automatic no usable this footage was I was busy watching the camera while I was busy driving and the camera all just came like this shaking all the time but I just took the black or X 7 foot drop if one threaded into the vlogs do you guys night very different to the so on it's got a lot more low down talked us definitely something wrong with the solo on it doesn't feel like the first tippers working on the silver one after driving the black one is quite a big punch for nine thousand comes again and

(Start: 00:09:20)
it is a bigger punch on that car and obviously it dies out because of the automatic I think it changes gears just under 7,000 which is pretty lame whereas the signature on the silver rx-7 is crazy you can really really really feel it now it's damn strong obviously this mobile car on the soul bar XM and I think 30-odd kilowatts with more standard however pretty sure the first tip it doesn't work on the silver extender so obviously I consider with my plans in the future maybe a single terror fixing first-ever on like I said on a defensive ecologist it feels pretty good I'm not very happy a little automatically named I'm gonna wrap up this vlog I'm sweating like a hobo I want to go back inside with a/c

Title: My R32 GT-R is home.. but it has boost problems!

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up girls and welcome to the vlog if you guys are new to this channel I have got an r32 GTR to rx-7 fds in a toyota mr2 sw20 I'll do a bunch of DIY videos miss around with cars and I'll try to do some informational stuff so if you're thinking about subscribing hit that button really appreciate it so guys I actually filmed a video earlier this morning I was reviewing the footage I'm not really happy that I figured I'll just do it again now I'm a bit rusty because I haven't blogged in about two weeks but I'm at the new house I'm here as you can see outside almost caught us in our exit or 32 GTR is here freaking awesome garage is a lot bigger than my previous one there's still a lot of stuff that does not need to be in hair like bags of cement a gate but you know it's a work in progress I still have to sand down the wall here this one hasn't been painted yet so single coat of paint what else have it done so for the first

(Start: 00:01:03)
time I've got a work bench full of stuff these boxes current just needed me better the way I've got Nussle - holy huh all my Spanish and stuff going from number 8 to 22 and with some random stuff here that I could use shelf washing stuff another shelf Connor needs to be propped up a little bit better but ya know the shelf with stuff and then I've got a pegboard that I thought I'll just put up a pick this up somewhere I don't remember where but pretty decent so if you guys want to send me stuff I kind of pick it on here set up a little clock Agora doesn't bun no means complete at all I mean the Lighting's not even finished yet like I said this was all put on hold because honey it's focused on the house so we are in the house now which is really cool we're now living in there we've been living in the house for about a

(Start: 00:02:04)
week now this was the last thing that I picked up from the old house it was pretty sad going into the garage area empty topped little geralt compared to this one I mean this side I've got a lot of room to walk around so if you guys remember in the previous card I parked really close to the wall on that side so that I could actually move around a little bit here I mean now it's a look that's a decent amount of space and I've got exactly the same amount of space on the side very cool still a single garage a little bit shitty but the gt-r is in here and the last thing is the old garage didn't have a plastic in the reefing so all the water used to come of this leak on top of this car so I've got my first ever issue with the or 32 GTR and it's such a weird one and it kind of put me off of the vlog that I actually recorded this morning and well I'm not gonna use it anymore I have this big

(Start: 00:03:04)
idea in my head I'm gonna go clean up the garage abode which I've filmed I'm gonna go pick up the car with an uber and then do this whole cinematic thing and we'll show you my new driveway garage carport whatever and picking up the car and I set up the GoPro still set up in I warmed up the car a full up fuel I'll put about a half a tank put an optin booster we're sitting at about a hundred run boosting issues actuate a boost hitting 0.5 bar that's all it will do these controls on fiddle with the settings they don't want to take any of my settings at all so I'll turn the boost controller wolf still actuator boost 0.5 bar switch the back on then all of a sudden I had 1.5 bar beast all the time no matter what I did I never went full throttle that I mean see it was climbing up to 1.5 volt maybe more I don't know but now the weird thing is this controller or forget point

(Start: 00:04:06)
five this controller on no matter what sitting no matter what offset it actually retained all my settings so it's not that it got wiped out it's still set to internal waste gates nothing's changed I'm just getting one point five boy it sounds cool but yeah I mean I'll probably pop something very quickly so yeah I need to fix that we can take a quick look now see what we can fund let me show you around the corner before you get stuck here so you're still busy over the driveway but for the most part it's see me done this rubble needs to be thrown over there and that's getting extended across there like I mentioned in one of the other videos we busy cutting back I'm gonna be setting up some garages here I could fit two Garrity's over there and I can put two guards on top of it you know I'm gonna hell of a lot more land on this side of the house and just trying to keep some privacy for now but there will be more garages that will be built but all ng tom here's the carport area is the mr2

(Start: 00:05:09)
so the plans for this area is a mark twos and a secure and where magic is right now that's gonna be living down there and tollable garages didn't run away okay but Jake will be sitting over there and in the spot will be the silver or exit so if you guys have missed out I have got and it's w22 I'm sure you guys are seen in the videos needs a respray in the front needs a respray yeah that's peeling I don't let the cause I'm pretty good Nick I'm happy jobs well gang well so that's the carport area that's my tool shed at the back obviously good tools stuff I'm using on the cause I keep it in the garage it's mostly for the garden workers and whatever but yeah we've got a mess of garden at the back there but

(Start: 00:06:10)
yeah I can't use it for cause I'm gonna keep the cost to the front and then there's some exciting news for future car storage but our quantity guys just yet until it actually happens essentially it'll be like a place to protect city cars plus very very very close to home so it'll take a couple months but yeah that's on the cars Rhona this is more of an update video but there's more between slicks but guys just by the way if the lighting is bad it's because I haven't finished that all there's still more sealing boats and I need to put it on like I said I'm still busy with this whole place but I need another set of lots exactly like that to there that one's missing needs to be put up another one there so yeah this place will be super bright the car has not been touched in two months I haven't done anything to it I did start it a month ago battery is flat charged it up started the car laid around for about 15 minutes then drive it sound fun no hiccups then I charged it up three four days ago

(Start: 00:07:11)
while I was moving stuff from the old house and well today I went and picked up the corner she's the car started up car drove on Quadro perfectly just that beast is she so here's what I think if I don't find it now maybe you guys give me some info in the comment section but it's either faulty boost controller the EBC is faulty which I really think that's the case it could be a vacuum early to the EBC that's an issue and it's giving it the wrong readings doesn't know what it's doing it could be a faulty solenoid in the EBC you know this guy over here I've been naughty and I haven't had any forces running on here so there's made some  that's inside they are twelve seconds later no leaks at all nothing about you all of these up pull them out of put them back in there's no leaks I've tested every single k.will every loose cable on its own fun so from one end to the other end no leaks pretty short see electronic

(Start: 00:08:11)
couldn't be bothered sorts us out right now what other issues on my hand I need folks on the house obviously we're doing just more things now I mean we we living in there at the moment but we're still need to put up our decor and all sorts of thing put up mirrors those stupid things a lot of garden work to do we extending the property so that's gonna wait for a little bit good news on Monday I have to take the silver rx-7 for certificate of roadworthy they're gonna test the car tell me if it's okay and then I'm gonna hand in all the documentation on Monday see the last things to the department to be sent to pietermaritzburg that takes four to six weeks and they will load the car onto the system then there's one last step after that which is the Interpol clearance they make sure the car hasn't been stolen in the country we have bought it from or any other country and yeah that's our except and stuff so I'll be driving the car of these logging out I feel a little bit bit of logging in this one I'm I'm tired I'm not used to holding a camera so bear with me then

(Start: 00:09:12)
I'll be back properly on the 28th back at work and then probably vlogging during that same week like proper vlogging so I'm just gonna upload these two in the interim just so he hasn't got some content but thanks so much for the support and thanks to its caught a Nazi 87 he gave me a decent shout-out the other day I got a couple of subs guys welcome if you new here appreciate it if you guys don't know it's Carter guy take a look at his channel it's caught in 1987 he's one of those Australian boys him entangles zero one go check out his channel to buy some of the Scotland's quarter may have seen his video when he raced at Lamborghini and absolutely Meredith that's the dude he's no YouTube channel he vlogs tangled zero one has got a busted or 32g the r32 gtst he's also got a 300zx go check out his channel cool DS cuz that's it for me hope you'll enjoy it boring ass vlog but it's a blog thank you so much for joining me I'll see you next time

Title: Toyota MR2 SW20 | Walkaround And Future Plans | EP2
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI2NOJMX5f4

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up girls and welcome to the vlog today I'm going to be doing a walk around video with my 1991 toyota mr2 now I need to warn you guys about something this car is a little bit rough around the edges it is a project car I did buy it on the cheap and I'm planning on fixing it up so here she is 1991 tra Morty SW 20 G limited this is the JDM spec the G limits that I believe has a slightly different trim to I think the G model they both carry a 3 s GE motor normally aspirated version 2 liter so just bear something in mind I've spent roughly an hour with us caught picking it up and then driving it back I haven't done a full inspection I was writing that there as well so I haven't bothered this is gonna be the first time I'm gonna see all the dents all the scratches all the issues you guys gonna see it with me so the badging is starting to show a little bit of silver underneath I know these were color coats or to the vehicle color rather matched Sierra badge as well Chernobyl the sun's away here it's a bit of a strange one but the keyhole sits all the way at the back there it

(Start: 00:01:02)
see the care card on the wing has pretty much gone so it's still that clear cut at the bottom here but on the top care card it's gone over my spot lots of those scratches on the side it looks like the previous owner or learner before that had animals jumping all over the car lots and lots and lots a little scratch marks now these can mostly come out bumpers cracked here paint missing sort it out car needs a good wash tape on the side I'm guessing stop the water from going in so it's probably missing a standard rubbers that were on there I don't know I'll have to take a look at that again scratches all over here looks like a dog's been jumping up more scratches on the side here easy to sort out now the car is equipped with these 15 inch one on 555 15 now these

(Start: 00:02:06)
are tiny these need to be swapped out probably do this just yet obviously girl's number focuses on the rx-7 and also on the GTR so so be on the back burner for a little while however I have bought a couple of mods that are gonna be thrown into this car it'll be into the side here another dance over there we'll touch on the interior in a moment paint is missing on this beading now this is the t-top or a Targa model if ACOTA where each of these panels left off and you kind of have a convertible get our remember see this is a project cost the front of the car is pretty much stuffed lots of clear cut missing bonnet is very very rough paint missing paint missing here again haircut pretty much gone on the bonnet even the number plate is fade it looks like a new light over there that one is cracked and it's old so I'll need to get a replacement for that side bottom look I've seen better

(Start: 00:03:06)
days got tons of little stone chips missing pasted Citra also a little bit strange but I don't know if the bonnet is out of place but these Lots just feel like they're a little bit sunken in or at least that one this one's a little bit higher than the other bit of smaller right a little bit of a rough spot yeah that's easy to sort out a little bit of rust here on the waffles paint again clear-cut paint missing on here the speeding flaking easy too slow so that's the exterior of my project car I mean for the price are paid which was next to nothing it's okay I mean it's it's driving it's working nothing wrong with it make sure you girls interior in tears pretty good right so you got your standard non tees JDM interior everything's pretty basic I mean the

(Start: 00:04:08)
interiors like straight out of a silica so the car comes equipped with these little bucket one of these seats but feels like the headrest does come out yep he drapes raises and it can come out dashboards in really good condition no issues no scuff marks it's really good however steering wheel has definitely seen better days lots of scuff marks everywhere I'm looking online is there always to sort this out otherwise just get it unstitched and researched yeah no radio on issue I'm gonna take the sound system another GTR I'm gonna move a chair cuz who needs the sound system you gotta be 26 love books if you only have but it'll us carpets and very very good Nick original carpet sought Souls good condition just

(Start: 00:05:09)
dirty house these seats it's got a little thing Hannah says lumber support hey look at that watch that you'll see that so when you pull down this lever thus either goes down or what goes up that's something new I've never seen that before drop the seat forwards and back here you got a little compartment that's cool put a gun down some I will store a bunch of cash it's here at the trim panels falling off so I got a speaker behind yeah I'm pretty impressed them and all

(Start: 00:06:12)
the stuffs got nice scuffs really really good handbrake differently needs to be readjusted I mean this is a liquor I'll start going forwards it has to be this hardest to hold the car gears are really really long I mean look here's neutral here's second all the way down there first is up there third fourth neutral kind of lives over there not even in the middle weird got air conditioning no climate control maybe it does I don't know it's got an econ mode whatever that is cigarette Lots on the side hazards over here I must say everything's still working the dish there wasn't issue you were no it's driving with the handbrake and I just

(Start: 00:07:14)
kind of had to fiddle with this little knobby here and a little handbrake lot window friend so it was stuck for my spot while I was driving and you got so I called tilt yeah so that's just tilt steering wheel okay that's cool so you've got a couple functions you have to manipulate the angle of the steering wheel this fog lights these little Japanese Roxanna power windows are working the electric mirrors aren't working there so in the front here you've got your spare wheel underneath the spare wheel is the battery that you sit through under there you got your fuse box some pretty standard some relays here as well I'm

(Start: 00:08:17)
assuming this is windscreen washer water it just says normal on the side you know what that's supposed to mean okay so that's the front with ugly the hell of a cleanup you can see how dark it is it looks good I mean just looking at it quickly it doesn't look like a car has been in any accidents just this needs to be sorted out a little bit of rust on these bolts at the bottom here so I need to get those cover off and on and see what's going on underneath it's not cleaning up a car that's the front some more Japanese writing over there okay that's popped boot some of you guys might be surprised but ours there's a boot on this car this is not with the engine sets and it's pretty spacious and goes down to just above my elbow I did see this on a video before I actually bought the car that there was this boot

(Start: 00:09:18)
in the back but prior to that I always thought the engine took up the whole space and when I said mid-engine I just thought the engine was kind of here in the middle but then this was empty but nice there's a beer fully functional boot engines over here took me a while to figure out how to actually get there it's behind the seat and there is a lever somewhere uh-huh oh yeah so right beyond the driver's seat oh yes she goes everybody notice this panel is our care and this one's quite sunken and someone's bent this so they're probably working on the car and I think pressure down there while they were working now there's no thing to hold the engine cover on it I don't know what you call the back section on it so they've put a little rod thing in the

(Start: 00:10:18)
front and then you kind of got to do this there's a little stick evidences rod and then you can understand put it together like Lego this is the engine three sge you normally aspirated two leader die not too much about I did have its big brother and one of my Silica's I had a caller science limited edition one of 5000 ever made it had the three s GTE four-wheel drive through cool car I have no idea why I saw that still regret to this day but yeah very very similar miter so nice thing about this one is it is stock standard intake over here stock as your throttle position sensor everything on this car looks stock now there is an exhaust leak carrier from somewhere it's probably coming from the exhaust headers I don't know just yet

(Start: 00:11:21)
yeah that's down yeah yeah there we go that looks yep it is sweet check the oil and it's just below the full mark now to get this back to where it came from a different story so cuz that's a quick walk around on the car I know something special I mean it is a project car it is a little bit of rough around the edges like I mentioned but it is my new tra mr2 depending on doing a little bit of work on it so obviously I'm going to clean the car up I'm going to start restoring the car and start painting things I'm gonna get it looking spigots bad and then I want to get a little bit more performance out of the cost so I didn't mention in the previous video here but the audio is bad and I've decided to cut it out so in the near future I am looking at doing an engine replacement all this car because I mean as it stands 121 kilowatts it's nothing so I'm looking at perhaps doing a beam swap which I think it's around 150 kilowatts plus minus or a three years GTE swap now someone gave me an idea yesterday they said maybe look at

(Start: 00:12:23)
turbo charging the beams engine so I'm gonna start looking into that as well but I mean this is something that's gonna be a little bit further down the line like I said I've got rx-7 to worry about a GT ought to worry about however I have bought some parts ready for this car so I have thought of buying some parts for this car and a lot of you guys might not agree with the route that I might be going now I have started buying some parts for this car and for the most part some of you guys may not agree with what I'm going to be doing but well it's my car so I've always wanted to do this and I've mentioned before in some vlogs I did want to get like a turn or a six or something old let's say early nineties and start buying vintage electronics for it and vintage parts when I refer to vintage I'm just saying here are specific so electronics by HKS a pixie trust or gritty brand names that were manufactured in the early nineties so up what a couple things already one being an apex II airflow converter so

(Start: 00:13:24)
that basically tricks the airflow sense or tricks the ECU to think that the airflow sensor is giving different readings where every high voltage or lower voltage etc and then the ECU will compensate fuel for those readings which essentially means I can tune the car but it's very very basic tuning there's no ignition Tomic it's just air fuel time that's just a few changes that's all and it's the very old school when it came out 1990 it's got a one sitting and you do it across the entire rear French so that's one the second one is I bought an 8 Pixy turbo timer it's the original turbo time it does nothing other than countdown our nose quarters never turbo just yet I don't know what the engine plans are just yet but it's always a good thing just let the car cool down a little bit while it's idle plus it sounds cool people kind of tell you hey across Florida while you walk away from it in parking lot now it is the old school one all it does is count down it doesn't study 0 to 100 it doesn't tell you your voltage anything else it just counts down switches your car off I

(Start: 00:14:24)
think it was made either 91 92 but they're both in really good condition I'm gonna flip them to this car there's a bunch of HKS parts that I can get greenie trust I've been looking at quite a few things and it's all era specific and I want to do the same thing I want to get wheels that were made in the early nineties and I want to get those wheel sets along the car any parts that I do intake etc it must be Aris Pacific I've always wanted to do this because I want to feel what it felt like to own a car back then in the nazis and modify with what they had back then that means i will also go for a turbo that was built in the early nineties it may not be the most efficient but it's from the early nineties and i'll get to feel what it felt like back there let me know what you guys think about that i think it's a pretty cool idea I've been waiting it forever that's by no means gonna change me by eternity X in the future or 180 or 240 you guys may call it I'm still gonna get one but maybe I'll change the focus from that

(Start: 00:15:25)
whole vintage era thing and I'll do drifting something in the car I don't know but yeah this is not gonna be my vintage era car you guys let me know what you think about it I think was a good buy I'm happier the Korins really well if you didn't watch that connection video have a quick look you can hear the motor running I got the GoPro face in the back so you can kind of see the back one screen you can see a little bit of the engine bay and the quarter of really well didn't skip a beat almost forgot I forgot to start the car for you guys okay guys as I mentioned in the last video I'm gonna be moving house this is my final weekend just to finish putting up these burglar bars not that one that's old putting up these burglar bars sitting up the loss of the security putting up curtains starting to move into the house and I'm gonna be AWOL for roughly two weeks plus - maybe about a

(Start: 00:16:26)
week from when this video comes out I'm not too sure enough but that's the plan I'm gonna be moving in now which means I'm gonna be bringing all my cars here Martin or move them all together right away because we're not exactly finished with the driveway and we still need to cut back all the section here and do you all the cement and all that stuff and having all the file cause here is gonna be a bit of an issue so I'm not just bringing the GTR pocket in the garage those car can go into this whole carport area back yeah we clean up all this rubble and dump all the stuff that we've been kind of breaking from the house and then eventually all stop bringing rx-7 and i'll our exhibit and yeah be one big happy family of cause yeah so guys that's it for the video let me know what you think about the new car let me know what you think about the project if you're gonna need tips if you got any help let me know I'm willing to take any advice and I appreciate any of it guys thank you so much for being here I'll

a super important day I'm gonna be picking up my tiara a more twisted Lee 20 so I'm gonna be catching at uber now it's going to take me about sixty kilometers the car came with a trucking company but their warehouses yeah 60 kilometers away from they didn't have an option to deliver the car directly to me but I figured what's the fun in that let me go pick it up it's an excuse to drive the car I can figure out on it etc so there are you becoming now it should be in the next three full minutes catch a drive into town somewhere pick up the car I'm pretty excited I've actually started buying a few parts for the car already I've got some rx-7 parts on the way and now with some mr2 parts in the way but I'll get into this in another video I've also got unboxing them every day pretty soon well seconds later [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

(Start: 00:02:00)
[Music] before you guys carry on with the video I've got something to tell you there was an issue with the second GoPro that I had so I had this little GoPro Hero 5 connected and that was facing basically like with us it was looking at my face and obviously it's a wide-angle said corpse the outside of the car the dashboard all that sort of stuff and it didn't record so I got on this morning and started doing my edit realized there was no footage on it and it turns out that there was an issue of the SD card and the brilliance a common issue at these 128k SD cards with a rack protect themselves and you basically can't do anything so any footage I have is from my GoPro and this is facing the rear of the car so audio is not so grand because I was running audio for other camera and

(Start: 00:03:02)
obviously all you can see is the back of the car but it was probably one of my bitter talking Drive videos and it's such a pity that wasn't recorded so I'll put a link in the description if you want to skip forwards and I'll give you the exact Tom Tucker and skip to 12 almost the end of the vlog but yeah that's pretty much it so sorry about that guys oh what a person is gonna be able to get yeah we got lost because we're in this massive business park yes sir and she found the place but nonetheless I'm inside my mr2 I wasn't able to film any real footage they're not allowed cameras because there's a whole lot of new toys that are getting delivered I'm sponsored as business complex speed bumps and a whole day on the hallway pretty soon so first impressions anymore - it's

(Start: 00:04:04)
a cool car first time I've ever inside one of these swet I must say it's bigger than what I thought interior was I mean there's no back seats there's no space behind me but because like I got a lot more space to move around it if you can get to compare it to the rx-7 very tart it's an rx-7 very small economy the seat back too much without obviously modifying it but this feels like a good a lot of room to play with getting back not at the maximum like I am an rx-7 again auntie steering wheel I mentioned before they beg very very big as well as a replacement emergency I have a big Chinese stand just like the re excited actually I think it's a slightly smaller the readings very driver focused and the gearshift of rachab on my hand if I had to pick on busy different ago since Russia the handbrake is ratchet everything is in place focus to the driver very cool so this is a project I bought this car

(Start: 00:05:07)
because I want to fix it and on a decent fixed it so there's obviously a couple problems one is clear coat in front is damaged - I'm feeling it now the driver seat is this looks like the front right bolt is probably not on so I can jump backwards and forwards one of the cool sensation [Music] third is the economy else is not on the car and there's no issues with the a quantum person is just meant on the car the cheap fix hopefully for there is a leaky gasket there be a hole and exhaust that probably changed these are things that I've just seen with the whole team Minnesota

(Start: 00:06:09)
and reduce become super news such as shine [Music] eliminates possible I saw the causative innovators [Music]

(Start: 00:07:09)
because we made it at the new house with the car in the garage like I said I cleared up a little bit of space but yeah this whole this ship needs to come out it was a pretty good test to see where the car sits and on our 4 cork boards I've got a ton of space in for working pretty cool I'm pretty impressed the Quadro squad I see here this from the back I'll do a proper walk around video if you guys right now it's it's raining I don't want to put the car outside and you'll walk around the walk around video in the rain will ruin my camera equipment and stuff but those are the car nonce Nazi 103 sgem I turn it see how the mr2 t-top these come off haven't figured it out yet then you do that when I'm not driving engines in the back here this little boot compartment there's another

(Start: 00:08:09)
compartment the fronts of the front is nothing it's just a spare wheel in the battery in the front and yeah it's just the two seats that's pretty dark in here I know but your little compartment at the back there there's no rear seats it's pretty cool so guys that is the vlog I'm going to end it right here I hope you enjoyed funding on my car and then I'm gonna be moving so don't forget about that I'll probably take about two weeks off and won't see me on YouTube or you reply to comments but that's about it okay guys one more video after this I'll do a walk-around but then no more for about two weeks guys thank you so much for being here with me I hope you enjoyed the video don't forget to Like comment subscribe I'll see you guys all next time Tuesday's ocean blue 28 sit over you karate chops and spit em out

(Start: 00:01:00)
now always like every two days or so I'll open up multiple tabs in google chrome and also two random things for example Subaru Supra GTR NHK is a big seat I'll just refresh them and if I see a good deal all I'll buy it maybe that's exactly what happened I found this car on my first choice but I've still won one and I buy it so they only land up being one person who gets this call right and let's give it a drumroll Gio de amor - SWE [Music] the only person to have gotten rod was the May 26th well done did please send me your address I will see you submerge so it's not the kind of picture that was just some random photoshopping out of it it's it's a black sw20 flashing on the screen right now so that too much to say about

(Start: 00:02:02)
the because I haven't seen it myself in person but so it is a instantly twenty however it's not the turbocharged model it is however a JDM spec it is wrought Hendra and it's the G limits of vision so it's got the three is GE might Senate non-turbo and it produces 121 kilowatts that's pretty decent for it in my car but cause 100 percent stock standard the wheels need to be changed though those will get sorted out and there's a little bit of pain for it so don't eat you just stood out on the front end of the car other than that it's pretty decent car everything is stuck now in terms of plans for this car I really don't know I've got a lot going on I'll just look at project you are gonna need to start finishing up on or rather maybe even starting my thinking single server it's not short the steady rx-7 I've got some goodies already be coming soon that I'll do a full unboxing video with my actually arrived but there's down pocket intakes there's a whole bunch of stuff that's coming through that'll pay be in about two to four weeks plus - so there's a lot on the go with cause the mr2 it was an impulse buy

(Start: 00:03:02)
it's gonna sit for a while I'll Drive it it's fully registered which means I can drive it straight away and I can drive it whenever the car is getting loaded on 18-wheeler this Saturday which means it should be with me but she's there wins there next week obviously once it's yeah I'm gonna be doing a whole collection video going to pick up the car you let's see my reaction so girls that's it I know a lot of you gonna be disappointed because not a super it's an opportunity six do I ever want to get it sooner at six at one stage and probably ten inside roof guard house let me know what you think in the comment section I'll be doing a full video we'll be doing walk around all sorts of stuff as soon as the car arrived Scouts thank you so much thank you for all the support I hope to see you all the next video don't forget to Like comment subscribe thank you so much [Music]

(Start: 00:01:00)

(Start: 00:02:01)
up I've been posting so many trees that are pulled down and also stuck on the roads are just collapsed I'm trying not to hold my camera as much as possible so flexing right there's a couple song posts that have been locked down pretty minor damage compared to what I've been seeing and I'm gonna get wrecking the road cut check out the new house make sure the HP is like I am to reading because an hailstones coming down the side just go up with the deer house and don't be still working out for college at the moment welcome to court area and this is storing all the rubble and bits of walls

(Start: 00:03:03)
that have been breaking now so this will needs to go to rubbish but yeah driveway flooded in here as we're even excavating but see a whole lot cave done over there so my granny's system every house will  up Easter garages safe not much has been done I've been focusing on security and pretty much everything else the garage nothing has been done lot things needs to be finished came out not the other day and these lots or super super brought we put lots in there there and then finish the ceiling yeah we're getting this lady we did some measuring and some been surveying this weekend and in the future not right now but cut back all the way to the fence and I can build a double garage at the bottom so I can come down the driver park few cars there I could talk to you plug this up any garage is over see next door here this little cop waters gonna be closed up and then I can put two guards on top of those two

(Start: 00:04:04)

(Start: 00:05:04)

Title: DID NOT REALIZE HOW FAST MY RX7 FD IS!!!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz2RBJQDINk

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the vlog there's a big day I'm gonna be driving more exhibit for the second time what for it's about 120 kilometer round trip that I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna get this Cory stamp with it number because that's stupid law that we have here so one of what a GoPro set up here it's a meeting my FaceCam thing - I've got another camera that's gonna be set up at the back here and maybe I'll rotate some of the views I was trying to mount this or magic holder thing so I'm not blaming anyone knowing throat doesn't damn well stick so first of all the trot some cheap saint-gobain double-sided tape that I had lying around I was quite then that obviously then works I went and bought the stuff that I usually bar to hold up things no more nails headaches so one roll equals K 80 kgs doesn't damn well stick I've cleaned the hell out of the dashboard it sticks well

(Start: 00:01:01)
on the scar it just doesn't stick on the dashboard so just before I started recording has a little piece that I cut off see it wasn't freaking stick it'll stick anywhere else now it's hard to get off so weird I don't know if there was some stuff that was used to Keeneland dashboard like simulator keno something but I've washed it down like four times now think about putting some rubbing alcohol but I don't know if it will do anything to this area girls I just made it to the new house in the rx-7 I decided to bring it here just to see if the clearance of beer care because I had issues of the driveway so coming down in the GTR I got my Duff

(Start: 00:02:03)
stuck and I got my exhaust stuck so I was pretty damn scary coming through so we redid the entire driveway coming down and we're gonna be redoing the rest of the driver I see so I figured which caused pretty low momma's will bring it down let me show you guys the clearance just before hit the garage my beer mom this cause stock standard I don't have quavers on a it is however the type area so slightly lower but I would like three fingers seconds later so to annoying things that have happened with the rx-7 so far one I try to wash my windscreen and the windscreen wiper got caught and it got caught underneath the other one so I'm sticking the bush on this one has gone just like the black car and it got caught underneath and when I try to pull it there's now bit so now it's so kind of in my points of view of the road second thing I don't think about any power of cooking pretty much no beast

(Start: 00:03:05)
I've tried getting to four and a half thousand it's just very very linear so there must be something wrong maybe a vacuum line or something that's out just go to each other but someone got a thumbs up it's most sick and thumbs up in an or exhibit go on no black one on this right away so just water no sorry [Music] this is such a boring drop so he goes I figured I'd at least get on the freeway and boost a little bit one I

(Start: 00:04:07)
have no boost - I couldn't get on the freakin freeway try hitting it again up this last hill and power it feels like it's just running an actuator boost and very linear all the way to the five and a half thousand doesn't even feel like that ii turbo stick and anyway I'm not too bothered the car is driving that's all that matters I'm only now just getting onto the freeway or the highway but I have no boost so according to anything this blog has been totally in the opposite direction of the Ruby I was actually like playing it in my head yesterday exactly how I wanna do it on against the house on a film and he'll thing and then either Sunita and it's

(Start: 00:05:07)
gone complete sub direction well for the first time ever put the coin fifth gear during 110 in the 120s on-call Phil Smith if he does need will learn meant pulling slowly to the left we'll need balancing other than that coffee feels good sister practice so just drop now to fourth gear and I'm sitting at exactly 4000 rpm and ups today at about 110 or down okay second timber is working okay let's change left in third test here I'm sitting at 4000 rpm 110 put my foot down run now still nothing significant

(Start: 00:06:14)
I'm gonna try third year 4000 sorry about 90 kids now a Shadowcat is working McMillon speaking for a completely stock car that is freakin Faust I've driven some pretty decent cars I mean our energy TR it's not the slowest around us of the fastest either I've driven a 911 turbo June 350 said you're a couple course of course cars and this is stock and it feels pretty ski here in the second tier kicks in shut the guy says something must be wrong with a small turbine because we're not one and I actually think if I recall correctly and are pretty threatened is hit it in the first video that I made I think I said the first tip is not working but

(Start: 00:07:15)
still feel like there's any puffed perkily yet when the second turbo kicks in at there's damn strong you guys are probably thinking oh hell it's a stock car that's not the point it's super lot the low center of gravity it just it feels like you're fine so we're gonna look down I mean I saw must be then it wasn't a crazy speed but it just felt so damn fast low center of gravity weight all of that added together it just makes this car feels so damn fast I'm so glad I got to go on the freeway that second server really really just under 5,000 120 or 140 goddamn Lascars quick again I'm sitting just under five thousand just under her

(Start: 00:08:15)
desk special 7,000 rpm 120 130 140 160 early I can any imagine what a single turbo version of this car feels like I know that dude in blue just a review now 200 horsepower single server that must have been ridiculous a lot of you guys know subscribe to my channel who have single saver conversions Jason watt you one of the days he's a friend of mine lives in Sweden and he's a single server and there's a couple things need to be done I can only imagine how fast your part ii turbo is pretty crazy I'm still obviously on paper and actually not just the favor benefits to race and I think I should organize one now but race against machi TR and this do you like a top in top run much easier I'll definitely flatten the spot but you

(Start: 00:09:16)
feel more in control and ha speed in the GTR I think this feels a lot better around corners because the GTRs are cast all that sort of crap but what this car has going for it dimension is the weight and all that sort of stuff first the GTR just feels 3d forest my temperatures are pretty decent checkmark a big cigar you see occasionally and apparently now sitting at 7 I'll see what a lot of people say be very careful around corners when that second turbo kicks in I now understand one more last one for the place 7,000 up here 160 on a private ranches bother it was third gear it was just over seven

(Start: 00:10:18)
I had about seven and a half thousand rpm and I just tapped 160 that was quick so pretty much yeah I am in an area called prospectin this is the police pound this is where they impound cars if you're doing something wrong they take your cars but yeah I don't know if they crushed it now if it's just storage I actually had my super ears impounded and the cost side chef it was a bit off it was in 2006 2007 I've actually still got the impound notice and myself my mate got locked up and thrown into a holding cell it's a long story but I got my car taken away from me and I'm actually thinking of doing a series when I move into the house and get some good lighting and good seating and doing something called storytelling and story Tom I don't know the name yet but basically just sit down and I've got

(Start: 00:11:20)
some pretty wild stories to tell you guys like for example first time I'm Couric's and anytime I own the correct I write off my Erichs there's photos on my Instagram if you guys wanna check it out there they'll kill JD look at that anyway so that's just Nadia for some new content she said I'm so keen to start modifying and working on this corner I've got those gauges that I need to throw into the car I know it's boring stuff but I bought a gauge potholders and I need I need that to be in front of me so I can actually see what's going on a pixie piracy I need to get that or magic holder on this probably like I mentioned the beginning that there must be some residue on have something and understand a teeny bit better maybe some rubbing alcohol or tried in a small corner of the car first before exhaust needs to come on intake need to come on I need to tune they fix piracy

(Start: 00:12:21)
okay thanks what is the time now Tinh run I'm back on the highway a little bit annoyed to get this event number you have to make booking a day prior or two days before which I did she's there a Wednesday latest wins there which is today and I'll be needing 17 digit number for this is no problem they're gonna order a whole lot of them I don't know exact yellow system were a bunch of them apparently I mean I sure quite late now but apparently someone came in early this morning with a fleet of cars that needed VIN numbers and their son all the Denver numbers there they had nothing left me

(Start: 00:13:21)
so again I'm one out-of-pocket for fuel and all sorts of stuff just to get away I go now go to drop back here again tomorrow to house late ale I guess it's like 7:30 some APM Epoque the call I took my G coming back to work carried on for the day and then I had to come back here for something else but I know it's just a whole lot of water behind or except and we're parked it and I want to take a look and you guessed it the ast split so this is actually the ast from that car I don't have thumb to fix it and I did say I think about three vlogs ago when I actually fixed whoa no temporary fix and we just fixed that little nozzle thing on there and bother doing this because all I needed to do was just get two tastings into it and then back and

(Start: 00:14:22)
that's exactly what the court did I drove 100 plus kilometers to that cause perfect boosted nasty second turbos Brustein laughter yeah I don't know it's the first ever boost I got almost so she drove the black hog in and see what it feels like but the first ever is pretty per second to her kicks hard it's really cool and yeah well something happened probably all the heat when the product was closed at the course which dauphin the buddhas can unsettle itself and yeah it fell apart I don't never with me now I took it off earlier it's about the house so yeah anyway I'm moving things from the black car across Europe because I have two Guardians please tell us tomorrow without fail TF gasps that's it [Music] [Applause] I get no

Title: How much did I pay for my RX7 FD? Honest Walk Around
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBKKi2gU3gU

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey what's up guys and welcome to a new video today's video I'm gonna tell you exactly how much I paid for this black rx-7 I'm also gonna do a walk-around video on the car show you what it's got what's on it what's wrong with it and why did I buy it so let's go through and start it up [Music] [Music] so behind me I have a 1997 touring X or X 7 ft 3 years now I'll be honest because this was not my first choice of the auctions now the reason why I bought this I had a certain amount of money that I was willing to pay for a car and it was plus minus about $5,000 and I was

(Start: 00:01:01)
trolling Japan partner TOCOM placing birds on certain cars that I thought out when and was my first time buying or exhibit obviously this is my first or exit and except for roughly about four or five weeks I kept losing Birds I came placed in a couple of cars but my expectations were a lot higher for what are we getting for $5,000 and I am a bit of a Mazda and that's all I wanted to spend now the time zones are very different between where I live in South Africa and Japan so I was having to wake up at 2:00 3:00 in the morning some days and chats the exporter and also look at the auctions and follow my bids and I was pretty much following my bids love I was super tired we my daughter was about three or four weeks old I decided to put some late night Birds or early morning birds on a few cause I received a phone call the following morning I landed up winning an rx-7 now I'm super excited they told me I won black 4 X 7 on 7 let's call behind me

(Start: 00:02:03)
and then also have the auction sheet I don't know what I did I put it on this car it's not what I wanted I wanted a C and a C grade for interior and a degrade exterior or vice versa and I'll ended up winning a de so this was a D on the exterior and a e on the interior which for those of you that don't know that's basically like a rating out of five so is pretty much the worst that you can get the car is in really bad condition it was a little bit better now there's a lot of work that's needs to be done I'll end up winning liske off way less than what I actually wanted to spend and I won the Crawford $2,000 it was actually under $2,000 now you guys can do the maths and shipping and all the cost I'm paid next to nothing to get this car back yeah and that's why I have to or exhibits now this video has absolutely nothing to do with this car but this is my non-starchy 7 top RS you guys haven't

(Start: 00:03:04)
seen it this was the car that I purchased after the black one now this stock standard absolutely nothing done to it I've changed these butts since the car had arrived but the car was 100% to standard now those car costs 5 times across now these BBS LM 2s these were originally on the black car added this one on the black car right now are the type RS wheels so that is the honest truth how I won this car it was a fail on my part I wasn't supposed to win this call especially never have this car but fate tells us here and it's with me now I'm going to do an honest review of this car as soon as I get the licensing I'm getting the licensing this week which means the call be fully road-legal and I'll be able to drive it whenever I want however I want I've never done a walk around on this car it's been a little bit embarrassing to show people because of the condition

(Start: 00:04:05)
that it is and but it's all fixable and it's all negligible so the interiors rated as an E which is pretty much the worst but it was littered in dog and cat hair all over in the seats everywhere you name it there was cat hair dog hair everywhere must will be a little bit in here but most of it is elf I mean it was full I could pull out clumps and the entire car was a little of that the car is also littered with electronics it had a nav system it had all sorts of microphones in a aerials these long arrows that you pull up from here one on either side and hit back some sort of settler TV system as well it was really littered with rubbish electronics stuff that I would never need never use so I did replace and insert that double didn't right here now the car isn't automatic and that is why I got it so cheap we're not won the car I thought okay not a bad thing I'm going to change it from

(Start: 00:05:07)
an otter get in your ECU put a manual box and it's not a big deal obviously plans have changed I now have the top RS now the only electronic but that I decided to keep was the turbo timer and as for the interior self the seat condition average is cigarette burn mark on hair which is rather annoying that seat is a near-perfect condition just needs a little bit of a wash this scuffs and scratches the rear seats on pretty decent condition there's a residue on there simply something that can come up and can come out rather easily most of the stuff is broken so the hooks on here broken is a line cracking here rather annoying everything else works the locking mechanisms away the water functions work the electric windows wig this however clip inside is broken so someone has thrown a bunch of pipe on it but I can sort it out I can do some

(Start: 00:06:09)
plastic welding and fix it up now this piece the clips on the inside are broken I just need to fix that it's not a huge deal and it's kind of because there's a boost pop here that for the B sketch that actually fit this sucks someone drilled holes into the dashboard and there were some gauges there and they're really in cheap shitty gauges on the passenger side this still needs a Polish the maths are pretty neat nothing wrong with the mats good condition those seats fantastic this just needs to get tucked back because I have to lift everything up and don't put it back properly few scuff marks this sounds really good I mean it looks like you just drive around by himself most the time and yeah that's a little scratch let's go however this is torn that's torn that's annoying the hinges are broken on us

(Start: 00:07:10)
so I'll just slam it shut please see this that's fixable over and he pulled it out I've had a look at the hinges and I can fix it I can do plastic welding on that no problem the touring ex was equipped with a sunroof sunroof functions no issues on the center console everything's working not working it's all fun air conditioning works a bunch of residue up the top here which can come out set another time to clean it up but you can see there was some electronic part of the day one over there one of the another one day and there was something at the back here and there was also stuff hanging from here clips broke another day good old fun what's up broken I can see why they go since the interior but to me this stuff is negligible obviously I wouldn't have bought this car knowing knowing fully

(Start: 00:08:11)
that it had all these issues but I can fix much this stuff I mean even less I can send this down I can fill it up with some key bond and then blend it all in all it was obviously used for storage it's got scuffs everywhere along here along there very different if you had to compare this to the top RSS the type RS is spotless the trunk or the boot is near immaculate looks brand-new this model had no struts race across the standard and there's also no parcel shelf that comes with the car so that was not an option on this now this is a JDM touring ex model it's not the same as detering ex model that you guys got in the US now let's talk about the exterior of the car the exterior is greater does a D now it had a little bit of rust on the car which I mostly sorted out but I'm not finished yet so there are rough spots in here I've just done some hammer on I need to actually set it down within that and this whole section here you can't write everything but that's something for nose huh same with here missing paints and a lot

(Start: 00:09:15)
of the section paint chip over there missing page missing paint lots of fully functional the look at this practically here are there a couple dents in this car one day in there but they're all funny they can all be pulled out and also do that this unfortunately happened when the car arrived at the shipping yard someone backed into the vehicle while it was still out of my position there's nothing I could do we have been reimbursed and I do need to get that sorted out but I'm planning on when I do you have some fake cash just get the whole car redone in the initial photos are the low quality photos that I did see before I got a full video of the car I did think that this could potentially have been an REM a Mia obviously not number plate holders rusted a little bit of rust of me there the trunk little boot lid it does have holes here from a wing that was on the car and the og guys will remember on the channel was car used to have a Veilside wing that Suns

(Start: 00:10:16)
been removed but there was some extra hole that we drilled him to the car to get that wing to put a little bit of damage yeah this has obviously been backed up somewhere and cracked a little bit of paint missing over there this door it's a slightly different color to the rest of the car you sure you guys can see that maneuver there so this doors obviously been replaced something happened it could have been an accident I don't know but the denotation though the door so that's why I want to get this whole car redone get all these things sorted out doodle together on the bonnet the paint missing the bush was gone on this whopper initially and it was kind of like sagging at the bottom so this section here was rubbing up against you every time you swing with wapis it'll come back bang bang bang knock that and every time you open up every time you open up the bonnet this would scrape on here rather annoying I've sorted out the bush that's all fixed now with regards to the braking and the suspension the hub

(Start: 00:11:18)
assembly was completely rusted on this car we had all the parts sandblasted clean it up and respray let's move on to the engine bay now this is probably one of the only areas in the car that was in decent condition or working it was one fault this pup here now this is a very common issue there is a piece of plastic that's unless end that's supposed to come up to about here and that kind of just peeled itself God and exactly the same thing happened on my top RS so I'll just put on us for temporaries and well it seems to be serving the purpose the ast cracked about two weeks into getting the car it pushed up radiator fluid everywhere so I had this reinforced changed all the nozzles to copper nozzles and it seems to be working okay I'm probably gonna leave it on this car for now however the other car probably gonna delete will get an alloy one now this car came with the HKS

(Start: 00:12:18)
super-powerful intake system there's another one hiding at the bottom there nothing wrong with them I'm probably gonna clean them up and move them to the other car and put the standard system back on this car I'm gonna try and get this car back to standard as much as possible but for the most part the engine bay just need to clean up a lot of butter Crimea unloaded it and a little bit of polish in the engine bay and it'll be looking good again take off this junkyard pin rising enough is a blow-off valve in this car it's a blitz blow felt a little bit of rust on some of these bolts actually most of them a good rest on it for the most part it's okay the car runs that smoke once before it hasn't smoked again on starts it's Mike's probably for 5-10 seconds and then it doesn't smoke anymore I hope you guys enjoyed the video that was a super honest walk-around of my touring X or X 7 AF D now I have been embarrassed to show you guys some of the

(Start: 00:13:19)
issues but you know what I want to be honest that's the car it's not the greatest picked it up cheap and still got a lot of potential you guys let me know what you think ever since Auto a lot of you guys gonna say forget about the order for now tell me what you think about the car eze us and the processor veteran if you dudes want to see an honest walk around video on my type RS probably gonna be a lot shorter than this one there's not much wrong with the car but it'll be an honest walk around on the car and I'll show you guys what's wrong either let me know smash that like button if you want to see an honest walk around on the r32 gt-r let me know - girls thank you so much for joining me I'll see y'all next time stayin blue 28 Syd over you karate school right

good morning guys and welcome to the vlog it's about quarter to 6:00 in the morning if you did so expecting a video we're gonna see lots of rx-7 action that's not going to happen this is purely an update video however I am filming another video at the black rx-7 and silver exhibit just in a few moments and that's going to be a separate video on its own what I want to show you guys was a little bit of an update what's happening on the car so if you didn't watch the vlog last week you would have seen that I've sort of pretty much everything out in the car except there was still that a/c bearing noise I was coming from here so the idiot that I am I take everything out which was actually another big deal and realized that there's nothing wrong with the a/c Barry at all that was the odd low tension a thingy pulley thing bearing in sod was shot if used an NS k3 6:06 bearing pretty pretty simple I find orders and often modest modest headstock was about 90 grand which is six dollars super cheap pre stood out replaced it and it's

(Start: 00:01:02)
all fun so I'm here this morning I'm just busy putting everything back together because I'm gonna be driving this conchis there I'm gonna be getting a tree stamp so that potentially will be coming out and they'll be putting in new stamps on the car but so all of it left to do is just put this part back on start the car make sure it's fun and I'll show you guys that in this vlog right now cause been sitting up a little while now getting rained on getting dirty [Applause] [Applause] something interesting I wanna point out to you did I never noticed this before and I was Ricky on the car and I always used to battle at the stupid pop and trying to fit it on now Baron mana I never took this pop off or not and

(Start: 00:02:04)
well maybe I took it off once in the day but mostly I'd not could really see much and I'll did it so quickly now it was just like seconds to put on these little alignment things yeah little arrows shows you way to kind of like fit [Music] and now that a super quiet [Music] [Music] [Laughter] remember before you say the stupid Street you say just ignore that I kind

(Start: 00:03:06)
of damage the fuel pickup since the thing when I was taking the fuel pump out I didn't damage up kind of put in the wrong place and you sort it up not having much luck with this car the car hit its heat suckle we had hit 100 degrees and the fan kicked in but then it was a mess of whining noise so sorry it's not on the cam I kind of rushed here and I went to quickly take a look and I'll switch the call this seems to be something that's rubbing up against the radiator fan I'll pull the black hole out and I was taking a quick look and I'm pretty sure it's just pop here from the ast now I'm going to start up the car again let it get 200 degrees wait for the noise and then I'm gonna start fiddling with that pop I'm just hoping that's it nothing else because it's an absolute mission to take this airbox often put it back on okay I was

(Start: 00:04:07)
super lucky sorted out the path from the ast was kind of just catching on the fans yeah alright see that on this car let me show you on the black one see all the way down there is it'll pop there now if I pull on the ast and see that little pop mirror and I'm pulling on this cable here on this high roller so that was catching on the fan on the silver car that's all sorted dudes I'm going to end the vlog shortly but I'm gonna quickly just show you update on the house obviously I'm not going to show you everything on the house but I'm going to show you the garage and I'm going to show you a little bit of the garden works for them in doing

(Start: 00:12:18)
AST we drilled over here and we put in these grub screws and there's two pieces is a plate on the top which you can see and there's a plate on the bottom so this one's not see secured and it's got multiple copper pieces so this has just got the one and that one like now I'm gonna do it I use T delete at some stage obviously I don't know where I'm going at this car right now direction I'm going I'm market of alloy ast or my deleted one enough so obviously I didn't make up my mind what I'm going to do in what direction I'm hitting with this car okay so we're gonna flip this quick and mark is the new videographer not with pretty much zero battery so if the battery does we're gonna switch across the big camera which is manual focus for video so we got the pop at the bottom here not a lot is limited for that first hand and so we got this popular that's still full of all sorts of liquid let's got Japanese coolant look okay is teasing Gauss yeah

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys and welcome to the vlog so it's been a little while since I've actually said those words what do you guys have noticed and I'm thankful that you have and you guys have been sending me some con words asking if I'm dead if okay hold us all right and you know what it's actually been quite nice just magne people actually wanting to see content and wanting to hear back from me which is pretty cool so we ever been I've been waking in the house I've been sick again like the third time I pretty much never get sick and the last little while I've been sick like four five times but also got sick again so yeah it's been about three weeks without vlogging three weeks without touching any cause I haven't driven the GTR I haven't I haven't driven either of these the black one or the silver one I was actually supposed to be doing the licensing stuff on that car but I got sick so haven't done anything so I'm grace like a little bit of an idiot because I've just been working at the house I've taken some time off work so

(Start: 00:01:00)
that I can try and fast track things there it's moving along quite nasty we probably be moved in within the next three to four weeks so till then videos are still going to be a little bit scarce but I am trying and since I'm take a little bit of time off I've got guards day at the house working right now doing all sorts of stuff work in the bathrooms and whatever it is that needs to be done and while they're busy I forget I quickly come here and do a couple things on the course so I won't use that I'm definitely going to be taking these civil or exhibit I'm gonna start doing some of the licensing stuff and there's a few small things that I actually want to do while I'm here so one I'm going to be putting some more petrol or fuel inside the rx-7 so obviously the car is not licensed yet I don't have my payments to choose there Wednesday Thursday so I'll just put up 20 litres that should be enough for my little trip I've got some octane booster that I'm gonna be putting in both cars that October Isolde is basically bring up the fuel to 97 or 98 octane and then I want to finally swap these wheels come to the silver exhibit so not talk

(Start: 00:02:02)
let's get straight to it see how this goes [Music] I wasn't so bad [Music] just say god no this is a hip pretty

(Start: 00:03:03)
random look I've got no real plans I'm just putting petrol in the car I'm changing the wheels and sticking my a pixie tar FC controller all lifting it what does it cool again it's a or magic holder for a pixie piracy so no real substance to this blog to apologize but you guys know the drill I've got a busy life right now and this is all I can do so I'm rushing I think spending about an hour off yet one more thing I want to change this pump so when I went for my first just kind of topped off twice let's make shifting so I don't want to order one just yet because I'm don't know what I'm going to do with this car I might be changing out putting off the market intercooler maybe a V mount which means I want to need to replace this part but for the interim

(Start: 00:04:04)
add you need something so I'm going to take off this black piece that I put together that I found somewhere a dumpster and I'm gonna replace it with one of these red pieces from a GTR and yeah try make something make shirt so I can actually boost the car yeah what do you guys think BBS wheels look pretty cool I'll take it never should paint these wheels black do you like tall black on black black mother pretty cool anyway those car looks awesome now the BBS on the one side it's cut up pretty bad oil leak that's from three weeks ago in the cars facing forwards so there's obviously a little bit of an oil leak on the sub - it's just leaking from the sump like so then I'm just changing the oil again getting a new sub plug washer and

(Start: 00:05:05)
[Music] anything is any power ship this cause dead as a doornail [Music] okay guys I'm gonna skip through to tomorrow morning how I'm gonna come back when this cause charged up and I'm gonna swivel the car around swap out the two wheels and then I'm gonna put up a little a pixie holder and work on the integral of Bob's thinking yeah it's it's been a long day I've been at the house the whole day doing all sorts of work so I'm Connor over today and working on the car anyway hopefully I'll be in a better mood tomorrow what up guts it's the next morning I'm

(Start: 00:06:07)
definitely a little bit grumpy so I've got the silver car already I'm going to be moving this one out a little bit I'm going to be swapping the wheels could be this thing start [Music] that's a bit of Sun come on baby oh yeah just finish the wheel swap black car looks like and it's not too bad and I say that yesterday but the guys think about doing like tested up black on the wheels or powder coating them black obviously getting a new scene to capture here and doing this whole black on black thing almost been too much money almost cost I'm gonna just leave these wheels

(Start: 00:07:08)
on there good enough maybe one day I'll get something decent but this looks really cool so I'm just like these ready once pick a little like nuts that look pretty cool on the car looks like a monster technology gap the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna split up this pop in the engine bay if I've got Tom I'm gonna take out the fuel pump assembly cuz this car just keeps showing an empty but it's not and that was me it used to work before when I was troubleshooting this call and it wasn't starting at some stage I kind of messed it up [Music]

(Start: 00:08:16)
right I'm just gonna flash forward because I'm running out of space in my SD card cause I'm gonna end the vlog here sorry for being a little bit awkward probably for the first time since I started vlogging I felt a little bit awkward on camera I've been away from her three weeks trying to rush things here with the cause a very limited time and trying to vlog so it's been a bit strange I don't know when I'm gonna post again next finishing up now it's like 7:00 something in the morning I need to go back to the house I need to show the workers what to do and I need to go to work on the house myself too but I'm having issues of the car and I'm gonna need to sort of start before Tuesday because I need to take it in for the Reece damping these red pops they're only marginally taller than the black one and I kind of need it to go over this little lip that's on that side and then I slipped in that side so it's not working so these cut off from the GTR aren't doing any justice so I'm gonna buy a black piece hopefully that opens today

(Start: 00:09:18)
if not on Monday and then just change that up and then take a call for driving shoes there Gus thanks for being here with me sorry for the weird shitty blog but yeah I'll see you guys when I see you what's up girls it's day three now and I've just run into big so I couldn't get this blow pop on because I was a bit too short and I want to kind of like go over talking really focus about the sorta raining it's raining so I've got this big pop on here but while I was doing that but a is tea break same  like a black clock so I'm gonna reinforce this stuff I'm gonna put in a cup of pop over here I'm still welded and old plastic water other and yeah put it all back together which means I'm not gonna be able to drive this car and she's there [Music]

Title: Answering Your Questions! Giveaway Winners!

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys welcome to the Q&A video this is going to be a giveaway video so at the end of this I'm going to pick five winners and the way I'm going to do that is a random comment picker and only the people that asked me questions for this Q&A are going to be winning prizes [Music] so I was actually planning on doing this video as a live stream last night but I had some technical issues and the live stream just wouldn't start so I kind of just gave up and I'm filming this throughout the day today so I've just printed out all the questions and I'm just gonna read through them and I'm gonna try and change scenery as much as I can make a little bit more interesting for you guys so there's no particular order to this I'm just going to start reading out these questions so the first one I got to us from the mick 26 graduations on order thanks so much did his question is we all know your little /jg in heaven however since the name of your channel is Nell Kel where and how

(Start: 00:01:01)
did you meet Kelly she that story if you don't mind okay so the channel is called Mel Kell JDM vlogs Lottie you guys probably don't know but my name is Nelson my wife's name is Kelly's I figured maked Nell Kel it's just for lack of a better name when I started over a year and a half ago I couldn't think of anything so I kind of just shortened both our names at a JDM actually I think I started off nelq lgt or vlogs so that's how I got an alkyl not the most glamorous of stories but we met a couple years ago six seven years ago now and we actually met at a pool bar I was out with a few friends played pool she was out with her friends and we saw each other and yeah the rest is history now we married we got a kid the next question comes from next level scrub would you ever engine swap the rx-7 and if you would what engine would you put in it I probably wouldn't engine swap either of these two but I have been looking at the auctions for some cheap well really dirt cheap ones but I'm probably not

(Start: 00:02:01)
gonna buy anytime soon because of this whole commitment of the house and our quite a few cars already and I still want to collect a whole bunch of the JDM cars in the future so what I'll swap these two no next question from Oh Dolores how many cause of your own and which one is your favorite I probably should have put some thought into this beforehand I've owned non-super is a mix of STR SWR X's and what we call GT turbos which are the gc8 models I've earned my r32 to FDS I've had tunas and jigs had a whole bunch of daily driver caused mostly hyundais and that sort of stuff 20 plus cause 25 cars maybe I don't know which one was my favorite probably what I've got right now a toss between the r32 GTR and rx-7 ft however I do miss my 1 GC 8 series that I used to own next

(Start: 00:03:03)
question coming from Leo or you immigrates the engine swap yes I really really want to get something cheap in the future I know it's seriously overdone in the YouTube scene but buying a 240 a6 is the way to go they don't sell them hence Africa but I'd love to get a 200 X to an engine swap probably an RB 25 swap and just build it from the ground up myself so I can learn things because well I'm still learning something a lot so it's on to your question yes next question coming from chars or what JT of engine is the most interesting and why to me I'll probably just have to say the RB 26 and the 13b rotary the you 13b obviously the way it works and how rotary engine works I mean it's all witchcraft and stuff the RB 26 probably because it would sound and the performance you get out of it and fortunately for me I earn both of those I'd love to get a 2jz in the future Charles actually got three questions so what got you to JDM culture

(Start: 00:04:03)
and who inspired you and what's your dream car so what God means the JDM culture was probably videogames and movies I have mentioned us in the old cure days cliche everybody has done it everybody's been influenced by Gran Turismo everybody's been influenced by force if here's one what is your dream car I would love to earn a early Honda NSX with a flip-up lots an expression coming from towards a May I really appreciate the shout out bro thanks so much we love the content so keep them coming man so my question will be really tricky you have an or 32 GTR 50 spirit R is 15 sylveon the first year NSX R you have to smash one sell one daily one and track one what'll be your choices okay our word daily the Silvia our daily the Silvia I would smash the r32 GTR I would

(Start: 00:05:06)
track the if D come believe I'm saying this and I'll sell the NSX are actually up Trek the NSX are and I've sell the FT this is a tricky question I hate you so next question was from mr. car would you ever buy a 240 is six questioners no because I can't get a 240 SX yeah I can however get a 286 so the 286 is obviously rotten drive it's the same shell it looks it on tentacle rotten drive still rear-wheel drive comes with a CA 18 DT engine so 1.8 litre turbocharged a lot of people and most of the cars are for sale already have the S or 20 next question coming in from JP havinga hey Nelson would you want to start an r32 club and d meet ups and some trek racing one day and do you think roster inputs is a good choice to buy JDM car or ship it from Japan myself I'd love to start an or 32 Club there's not many around I know someone just recently got one in Durban we are live it's a maroon

(Start: 00:06:08)
one stock as far as a belief or close to stock do meet ups definitely obviously I don't have time right now with this whole house story and just laugh in general but I'm really keen and trick racing I mean I used to get heavily involved in track racing I used to trailer the car up to Johannesburg which is about 600 kilometers or five six hour drive with a trailer and go track the car and I really do miss that so the next question is about importing a call yourself or dealing with Ross P imports now I've imported my cars myself and it's been a bit of a tough journey purely because I just don't have time you could probably knock it out and they've said two months with the registration of the cause for me it's a different story because I'm working full time when I'm not working I'm busy renovating the house and I'm doing other stuff and obviously I've got family commitments as well so it's been a bit of a tough journey for me but I'm getting it done things slowly piecemeal so like I said in the previous video I get one permit

(Start: 00:07:09)
and then I've only got enough time just to go do a Weybridge in the following week or maybe two weeks later I get another permit then I go do the police clearance and then submit my documents like a week or two in the future but you can do it with like one permit go through do very dot do Weybridge do your police clearance submit the documents are just another thought Ross / imports however I've met him all he is the owner of Ross / impose good guy he's passionate about what he does and he can help you to get your car with my headaches so he'll bring your car through from Japan he will help you with the process buying a car you'll show you the auction sheets so if you like me and you don't have much time on your hands I'll definitely consider Ross / imports now I've met the owner person his name is him oh now he is passionate about what he does and he can help you bring in the car of your dreams now he'll sit with you in the beginning and he'll wake up budgets and then he'll show you what he can provide you and go through auctions etc and then he'll help you bring the car down he'll do all the

(Start: 00:08:10)
registration for you and provide you with the vehicle and at the end of the day you walk away with a smiley face and a squat the driving JDM car and everybody's happy cars registered you got your dream car some are got some business next question coming in from amid Misaki would you choose an LFA or Supra r33 rs6 in in s6 I would probably take an NSX to be honest another LFA is a lot more rare and only met I think at 400 of them but I'm dying to give myself an inner 6 an excavation cover from the frivolous melon have you ever considered touring visiting another country to see drifting or racing if you ever run out of deer can you make a video on how stuff works I could distribute it etc I love the stickers I'm probably not big enough to do any Turing I barely get out of the house myself right now so I vlog in the garage do DIY stuff I've haven't been to race event enormous tears haven't raced in about three years

(Start: 00:09:11)
what's sad actually I need to get out there but I'm busy working these cars and I'm working on them slowly and I'm filming and this time is running away from me when I finished this house I'll definitely get out more have a visit to another country to see drifting or racing I actually haven't when I was in Dublin Ireland a friend of mine and myself we were planning on going across the UK and doing Silverstone hiring a car tracking it but that just never happened Whelan just going to pubs and drinking's yeah next question coming from Dee's 30 now this is actually a personal friend of mine a question would you earn a German car if so which one would you choose no dude why would I earn a German car and I'm killing this is a tough one probably a 340 I knew one probably in blue as well like yours I know yours are 3-3 five but assembly that one 340i next question care from Oliver Bertrand have

(Start: 00:10:12)
you ever done scale modelling if yes which was your favourite of Bill I have I bought some Tamiya kits and r33 GTR v-spec to midnight edition and I will support a tee reciprocal never got around to building the r33 GTR I started building and just took a little bit too long I actually started building it around the same time I started vlogging and I kind of lost interest on that because vlogging is a lot more fun and I got to work on the real thing in my garage so yeah I did try my hand in it I've still got it and it's bad halfway but the next question comes from eat your vitamins you're always mentioning cars that open-source collectors items and ESA thus making a beautiful import but a con sent to funders list could you elaborate again so essentially I'll just refer to it as a list there is no difference of the lists I've been putting together my own personal one and there's a couple of cars that are on there and are 32 33 34 GTR obviously or exhibit FD and there's

(Start: 00:11:13)
a few others NSX is collector's item is 15 there's no longer collector or was not on the list but might be coming onto the list tier supra is no longer on the list as of 2014 I believe basically this list is put together by I tech so if you give them a call or email them you basically give them the model of the car the engine top and why you think it's really and then they're gonna check to a few people and one of which is sever which is African veteran and vintage Association and they kind of figure out is the car a future collectible is it a collector's item etc it's like this whole thing what's your ultimate driving song I don't really have a driving song actually I don't really listen to music while I'm driving to be honest if I had to say it would be music from need for speed most wanted the original one stars will be on now that sort of stuff

(Start: 00:12:15)
cheesy or not but yeah that's it I mean currently on the GTR I think there's like four songs on a CD I don't even have a USB your Flash Player thing I wasn't too sure this one as a question but I'll just consider it it's from Dairy and Mercat I said where some 2k glad you're putting the BBS on the silver but black questionable question mark I think black would be a good for been looking at a couple thoughts like speed hunters and things that I actually want to deal with the car in the future and silver and black look pretty cool I'm going to throw the BBS wheels on the car first see how it looks if I lock it I'm going to leave it and obviously just refurb them if I don't then I'm going to be black but I'm gonna Photoshop it see what it looks like with black wheels and then go from there next question is from just a loca do you like spaghetti know that honestly no

(Start: 00:13:15)
don't a rainy spaghetti at all I do pasta salads that's about all the last Q&A I think you asked me to I eat bread did Oh before we carry on I'm inside then you get out you guys have noticed it's still a big mess but look up ceiling boards and well off of it now I started fitting lots that ones on these are 18 what led Lots I'm basically just going to have them lit across so there's two that are wired on that side and then there are three that are priced here so the idea is cause it'll be parked over here and injured by it I'm gonna get some good lighting and then I'm gonna be doing a lot of thing yeah lasting there and I just need to finish the rest of seizing boards the next question is going from Nick okay what was your biggest drop in starting the channel so Nick honestly it was about a year and a half ago I decided that I'm

(Start: 00:14:16)
going to be putting an electronic boost control it's maya32 gt-r now I had this booster trailer for about three years and I just never got around to filling it I've done it before many times on a silver pretty simple internal wastegate setup it's it's my brain I'd quite easily known or 32 GTRs a different story with regards to plumbing and if you do a search on lon there's not a lot of info on how they actually did and damn our battle and battle in metal eventually upon some info on like a super forum and gave me a couple of Diaz and a little trying things and then I have to kind of figure out will vacuum diagrams and how everything works in the engine bay and at this stage I was never really good at working cause and I'm not any good at working cause now but I'm trying to order than I have you and I realized something what if I start filming this to help myself in the future so I'm gonna film foot sing with the Beast controller and

(Start: 00:15:17)
configuring it and if I ever need to look back I can go back to this video and you know what I actually have like two or three Tom's gone back to the video on how to configure it because I explained to myself but then I figure you know and I can help people out too so this was definitely one of the biggest drivers installing the channel helping myself and helping people and one it also helps me grow because I want to do things right and do it properly and take my time and doing things always always throughout my life used to rush jobs car jobs are talking about always rush the job quickly get it done get out carry on through some a lot now I'll take my time and I appreciate it for that Christopher cook what an awfully to GTR being good day in the States depends on how deep your pockets August for me wouldn't be a good daily I don't know your circumstances but obviously I've got an eleven month old daughter and I need a reliable course I wouldn't go and put my daughter in the GTR

(Start: 00:16:18)
and she probably won't sit in the car for a very long time so it depends on your circumstances I mean if you single and you work just down the road from we love then maybe it's not a better day I depends your circumstances but there's a whole other factors too for me I wouldn't get it as dating next patient care home James Papas you see it's I've talked about it a lot in a couple of other videos but not a detail what's your dream journey home garage up to five so this is actually quite a realistic question because I'm building up to this one is obviously the r32 GTR that are currently buying two and rx7 ft so I've got chillers covered for now then I really really want to get a 286 or a 180 or two for my caller and I want to turn into a little bit of a drift car so I'll be 25 and yeah all the purpose next and other

(Start: 00:17:19)
sponsors but hard to come by I'll have to buy locally I wanna be able to import it because it's illegal to import there's a tiara steeper mark for they love to get my hands on the next one and the last one is an NA six a Honda NSX old-school 91 92 93 flip up hit lots I'd love to get my hands on that that's five vehicles but I do 106 yes 15 Silvia next question coming from Joe O'Grady what made you start vlogging I guess same answer as Nick a yeah I just wanted to help out people help out myself and now bring the blocks so next question came from Jason assessment where did you find the love for JDM cars basically you know Keisha again I mentioned this in the beginning but gran turismo fast and furious that's it that's where I fell in love for it I've always been a super offended exactly JDM I did however have a JD a provision I had a type are a WRX type all right and

(Start: 00:18:21)
that was my only JD and one that the rest were all aspects yeah and I mean that stemmed out from earning supers and playing those games and watching those movies and now our fortunately for me I've been able to buy these cops which is pretty cool especially coming up from could feel are how long will it take you from start to finish to import the GTR were you ever scared of not receiving it what does the total cost of importing Tooting registration okay so start to finish importing the car it was actually pretty quickly I mean from finding the corner auction paying the money and it's the same processes that our exhibits the black one took a little bit longer because there were a couple of issues so the r32 took about two months from final on the auction winning it and getting it shipped to South Africa same with a silver our exhibit the black one however I won it in I think it was November or end of October and because of the whole

(Start: 00:19:23)
Christmas time there were less ships and bla bla ships were loaded i'm actually not too short little story but i couldn't get the car in two months it took like three months to get you yes I was pretty scared of my first import and the reason was when I imported I was actually working in Botswana at that time and I was working in copper nickel mine in Botswana doing some engineering work and damn there were no comms there we didn't have cell phone signal I didn't have access to the Internet at that stage when you're working in a mine things are kind of locked down and closed networks and all that and I just won the car the week before two weeks before and that week that I started working at this copper nickel mine I was there for two weeks at this month the card just got sent on the ship to cipher guy and I couldn't track it I don't know where the cause then one evening my work colleagues my wife we were at the

(Start: 00:20:24)
bed-and-breakfast and we were watching TV and there were tsunamis in Japan now this was 2013 there's some big tsunamis that happen I think it might have been the whole nuclear disaster not too short maybe anyway it was they were tsunamis they were happening at that time and I'm freaking out I don't know where the car was how far was in the ocean we're still in Japan and I had to wait two weeks to get back to you South Africa to make contact and track and trace and see where the ship was so yeah I was pretty nervous on the clock she arrived a so I'm not going to tell you the total cost on my car but I've mentioned the car the videos basically you find the kind of auction let's say for a really good one you're gonna pay about 20,000 to 25,000 US dollars look or twenty thousand US dollars then you're gonna pay a small percentage to the guys that are doing the importation for you or the export for year rather from Japan small fee on that side shoppings and cost

(Start: 00:21:26)
about $1,000 then there's a collector's item and fee which is 25% of the vehicle amount then you're gonna pay VAT or tax which is 14% in South Africa on the total invoice amount that it treats shipping includes that exporters charges in to pay 40 percent on that amount now once the cars here there is a couple small fees that you've got to pay nothing nothing hefty at all they are in RCS fees which is about 2 grand and police clearance and a couple things last and single Department fees your certificate of roadworthy your Weybridge call it 5 carrier just done and you got your car next question coming in from the laning phase old time subscriber how long did it take Oh if there's one mountain pass which you could drive right now and any car you want to which parcel would you call it damn I actually don't know any decent mount deposits I've always wanted to do

(Start: 00:22:27)
the NAS on a hilltop which happens every year here in South Africa it's a massive thing I called some older Hill Club it's sponsored by Jaguar board this year I think was in the Sun and some crazy false cars gone that I would love to do that there would be very realistic for me to actually get out to and do but if anywhere in the world it would be the initial D Mount Akina or Mount Haruna get out there dude in 86 or my FD expression coming in from City skyline 34 what are the pros and cons of retrievers from your perspective I'm gonna go to huge detail into this one it's a mess up topic and I actually do on a plan of video on some rotary stuff so for the sake of that video I'm just going to say reliability and maintenance what so obviously the rotary a lot of people perceive them to be less reliable whilst there might be the case it also comes down to poor maintenance

(Start: 00:23:27)
so if maintenance is a big thing if you just wait to get a car that you're gonna jump into and just drive all the time that's not the right car for you if you don't want to go and check oil every time you drive it's not the right coffee but that's my perspective on it but we'll go into this in another video really check me a couple of months to actually make it because I've got to finish all of us and the rest of the house and yeah this from king if you could live anywhere where would you live to be honest I think I'll just stay inside Africa so next question comes from vlogs with Josh one of the best and worst experience you've had with your r32 I'd love to know a little bit more about this garden okay this has happened about three weeks prior to me starting my first ever vlog so I set up to do an oil change and water change on my r32 gt-r for the first time for myself I've

(Start: 00:24:27)
already had other people do maintenance of it but I figured I want to start working on cars myself and I always used to pay people in the past to do stuff for me so I figured let me stop learning and doing the stuff myself and I spoke to someone he said okay you need to get a 350 said oil filters for the Sam 3 at the same sauce so I went out and got it and we kind of put the filter on and I actually had a backyard mechanic who came to give me and because I was actually badly to get the damn full soften and I didn't know that trick where you kind of put a screwdriver on the top and you beat it with a hammer you can turn the oil filter and mudstone the stop application so I couldn't really get it out properly and we'll got it out change the filter thread filter kay we hand tightened it change the oil change the water did everything asked shook hands with a guy and then lift now I drove probably about two kilometers maybe three kilometers now we warmed up the car we check for wheel leaks all that stuff the house and everything was

(Start: 00:25:29)
okay then I left our driver drove like two three kilometers and I landed up seeing a c63 AMG on the road and I figured you know what my cause quicker it's yeah give him a run so I put my foot down and as I head boost I just heard this huge explosion from in the engine bay and my corpse thought beeping oil pressure went down to zero on the spot gauge and I had it off the market gauge at the time but it's went down to zero cause freaking out I had no idea what was going on pulled over inside the road and I know it's just there but all the oil came out everything on the floor shut the call already shut off but damn it was scary so I find around I started doing some googling and I promise you to google this without just taking someone's advice and I found out that the oil filter that was meant to be a match up for the cause actually a 300zx

(Start: 00:26:30)
a lot of 350 cid and pretty anger that's arm went back swapped got a new oil filter put it on hand talking to change the oil yeah cause been fine ever since with 300zx oil filters before I did any toss I'll make sure that I know exactly what I'm doing how it's dirt and how long it's gonna take because I don't want stuff I get it happen I've got away very kini very lucky I could have lost an entire b-26 okay last question coming from split bond found your channel from the search on learning r32 you recognize the accent I'm also Phyllis Africa and you seems a good content how much the cost initially and how many kilometers that have have in the clock the correct seventy-six thousand kilometers on the clock true mileage was an auction sheet was correct I think it's got eighty four thousand now I've done about 9,000 10,000 Kay's of them for oil changes doing about to do my fourth one now actually sorry how

(Start: 00:27:35)
much did it cost you okay so I mentioned a couple comments before they don't know how much you actually cost me I don't particular say but you can kind of work it out yourself they do cost quite a bit now because of obviously the draconian law in America 25 years and although they can start importing these cars I'm also thinking about buying GTR and looked at JDM cars at around the same price and thought about considering your options what's your opinion I love my $32 if I had to do it all over again I probably would have saved up a little bit more money and I would have bought a North 84 GTR you're looking probably about seven hundred thousand plus - ran to get one of those cars I probably would have done that I still like to in the future but I want to get the rest of my cars together given our 32 it's a cool car okay guys that was the last of the questions I'm gonna go off now I'm gonna head off to my editing station I'm gonna do a random comment picker and I'll film that and pick five comments of people who

(Start: 00:28:37)

(Start: 00:01:02)
not here to talk about building stuff but anyway garage is getting a lot better so what would dudes are busy working leads to the house and a stuff I'm in here and I'm messing around and yeah blues la banda okay first lanzar window big burger balls are going to go in there and obviously that's going to come up and I'm going to for coming decent to block the view from unwanted those getting painted white with Apple first coat first coat on here first coat on this wall and then just been retouching areas sanding it down and D are looking a lot better at the wing from Laura x7 probably going to sell that out only I'll ever use it again anyone else here for now and it's funny I also got the cockroach here a formalist and storage was from one of my whole series you can offer gc8 better perfect custom Integra head on the products and then actually don't remember why I used it or didn't use it

(Start: 00:02:04)
and those are the stock down pops from r32 GTR of the big ones mate Sydney six mil going into 100 mil or three inch into four inch I think I guess it blends with us Garrett this is where the print is gonna be so there's going to be has put somewhere over here and it's going to be like a half size pizza I'll go down some sort of like stairs on the side so basically down here and I'll come up and I'll be able to look at the car away from the car but I'll only be able to work on part of the car so the front and middle and then one way from the back I left in the car around I don't know where I'm putting stuff just yet I'm going to put a desk over here so we're clear al-assad but all else to do so obviously ceiling is be redone of cultural boards like this and new corners furnaces and I'm going to be redoing all of that eat lots going to come out we'll drop them and mean last things and they come in obviously laughing very important for the vlogs

(Start: 00:03:06)
and working on the cause video first and that's the new garage coming along slowly I don't show too much of the house just yet because it's Lord's and privacy but behind me is where we busy making new driveway making small space and park cause the driveway was a bit shitty at best they kind of had a long driveway where you come in and all you could do is just get into the carport and into the garage obviously we didn't like that we did see potential because quite a lot of lens we've been destroying it brand new driveway and it's coming along slowly yeah it's been tough but come along so let me show you guys just behind what with a jew coast okay so over there we started we started digging and you can see over there taking ever there's a tree behind the cheek that's coming out that tree over there those trees are all coming out and this section over here is all going to get flattened and there's gonna be space

(Start: 00:04:07)
for course and yeah we're going to be putting some stuff at the top so we're arranged that obviously the land doesn't fall and mud and all that stuff so yeah is he sorting that off and then let me show you guys around the corner here's the mess with the quarters so this is all stuff we're even breaking tiles these are the whole car that wins like you're crazy old knocking for the tile bring nice big Italian towels and changing the floors break down some walls over here there isn't want extending the place every single thing that you go see on the stud Paul came out of the garage there's really single piece of wood the table they did have so much storage space you never pop the corn sideways because of the cardboard we I'm gonna be parking rx-7 and probably Doric well maybe by Thor environment storage shared

(Start: 00:05:08)
that I'm busy fixing needs some pieces of wood and varnish just redid the putty on the windows I need to just shake the party but it's a storage shed where equity tools and I can keep all sorts of stuff yet it's been leaps and bounds and the interior and we've been knocking down stuff had the whole place repainted a lot of house been redone from flooring to walls to new burglar bars to putting in new windows as well like I mentioned a little while ago we got the place of the cheaper than what we we're planning on my house for so we take whatever money and we've been spending it on renovating making the place look cool soaking it up so different space and it's working out and I just want to live in here quicker so I can have a little cost together as I can so we and well this is the reason why women really uploading I've taken three four five days to reply to you guys Collins because I've been here I've been working and we're not in the garage probably full of the walls until Earth left

(Start: 00:06:10)
I'm busy managing the guys I don't have a contracting team I've got a team of guys that I'm telling what to do and managing on a daily basis my dad's helping out he's been a huge help unless then I've learned so much along the way so it's been a real stressful rod but wewe we're probably a couple weeks later so about three weeks delayed not moving in sir three months September to end of September then I have all the cars here and we're going to change the brake pads in the week so I'm going to shoot to that place you back again with the rx-7 but I'm not going to make you my card fortunately I think change the brakes of this guy and break that gone I have about 56 57 thousand kilometers done on the course therefore because I want a set of ultimax pads to be these are made by BBC they are somewhere inside half of the black rx-7 these are the EBC ultimax to

(Start: 00:07:13)
you so basically this area my basement but is a little bit better but anyway I'm not looking for some serious performance it's just the tuner it was careless in cheek but before we start I've actually runs an issue this car if you guys remember a little while back at an issue when I was importing it and I asked the person at the nrcs what is the ETA on the vehicle Arabic and that person replied what is ETA or what does ETA mean that completely blew my mind I'm struggling to get in first awareness car get cleared from customers and that just doesn't help me anyway I'm having an issue at the same lady again he's just recently like three weeks ago Possible's car and said it's okay to register in license which is in process right now and it'll be lost in the next like 3-4 weeks is now giving me an issue of this car saying it needs a 17 a digit VIN number and it needs to be stamped new VIN number new plate it needs to be stamped on the chassis rather freakin annoying

(Start: 00:08:14)
because one it's a collector's item here too I don't damage the chassis you can use them I don't want them to each new numbers on there I don't see the difference so now I'm arguing with them saying the black or exit is exactly the same car same model same make same year number even and now you've got a different set of regulations for the silver one it makes left even I sent and the person keeps coming back on email not one string my question I'm actually saying as the LOA here's the documentation rather for black car which you passed yourself personally you two weeks ago why are you not doing from the cilco replies back one sentence as per your initial document arse data that I want seventy digit no hope no answers nothing I don't want to get reset it means another trip to the police station or just like 50 kilometres away you're not that Robert it's pretty fun

(Start: 00:09:16)
it's just more time more money I was hoping to get this call us as soon as they later much seen the black cross remember I can grab a call is getting down to that break issues blah blah blah so I'm a little bit annoyed I'm Monica speak to someone in management there and hopefully going to be but it's a collector's item you shouldn't be itching your chassis number and you shouldn't be doing all sorts like that so let's take a quick look at this car because I know a lot of you guys are not happy there it's going to be a jig for here but I've been busy well I'm at times player cool cars so the first time I'm actually looking at this cost since I drove it so engine bay that's left purple they fix this now because that's Cupid cover that was sitting over here put on fire and kind of melted every freedom or so strange thing happened in last two days the video of me driving

(Start: 00:10:16)
was called for the first time ever it was a one used first - about two days ago all of a sudden now it's been getting like 500 years a day those are really poorly on my part I mean I literally just stuck the camera in the back of the car filled the back of my head the entire draft nervous as hell spike utter crap while I was driving and it's getting views and it's getting locks a couple dislikes but it's hitting a lot of like seen a little bit of a surge of subscribers coming in recently it's pretty cool so I'm guessing one of you guys shared the video which is awesome so thank you so much I should probably say right now if you need to the channel hit the subscribe button the wiki videos I used to do two three sometimes four videos a week but I'm really building a house at the moment renovating so taking up so much of my time soon the land settled I'm going to be back on track I'll be doing some fun videos like a you see so hit that subscribe button because I'm going to carry on as our exhibit in the black one

(Start: 00:12:20)

(Start: 00:01:00)
our together and each is going to keep the car for the race today pretty cool for him and I'll put my silver on Russia so not much has happened I'll give you guys a little bit of an update while we're driving so we swap places the black ones been washed this one needs a hell of it back until old Dustin okay guys let's get in the car and we in for going off you guys free with an F now expense okay guys welcome back we are inside my Anderson jig sorry for the mess and the kiddies toy is behind ya this is my daily driver my wife's car actually you pick up a daily driver for myself so we've been looking at a couple cars recently possibly a Subaru Forester XT or 2.5 XT I think it's 169 kilowatts decent but nothing just yet I need to finish this house we can get back on our feet those houses has been crazy expensive renovations so a quick rundown of what's been happening at the house I've been tearing

(Start: 00:02:01)
everything down so bathrooms have been torn down all the tiling everything on the walls it's all been torn down so new footings new everything that's been coming in we've redone all the floors and all the bedrooms we've put in some vinyl flooring a lot exploring it looks really good there's been new large fittings and lighting all over the place we've been putting in obviously repainting the entire place there's been a lot and I've pretty much forgotten what's been happening it we've been knocking down a couple of walls I've been running all sorts of security systems and been running conjurus and cabling for camera systems and all sorts of stuff and one really big update and it's quite exciting and I actually did film some stuff about a week or so ago to be brutally honest I just haven't had time to edit and upload so I figured out these list is a little bit of an update video and I walked around the house I

(Start: 00:03:01)
showed you guys a little bit of what's been going on and how bad the garage is the garage has changed significantly it's actually getting all the holes patched up today and I'm getting some paint work done on it the carport area where I can fit two cars actually do you know which cause I put this little more than likely be the silver exhibit maybe this black one in front of me maybe the Juke I don't know yet but we've been tearing down the entire driveway building extra parking space lots of parking space actually so I mean previously before that's such a hot driveway with just lots of trees and I gotta go so before you turn away if you haven't noticed or exhibitors in front of me we on the way to the licensing my dad's driving it and yeah I'm going to be going back to work in this car shortly after so going back to the whole driveway area these people were very much into having vegetation and flowerbeds and all sorts of stuff which is cool I'm actually leave the back

(Start: 00:04:02)
garden for that but the front area it was just one sliver of a driveway and there was enough space to get into the garage in the carport and you have to do like a 10.2 and just to get out the driver so we've torn the place to pieces now essentially there's no rear parking for plus-minus I mean will be difficult get the cause out but they'll be parking in here as a GTR or 35 they'll be first - parking for about eight to ten cars which is pretty cool it will be difficult to maneuver them but there's parking for 810 cars in the driveway there's still going to be an area in on the other side of the house where I'll be able to set up a double garage but that is in time and that's a lot of money and yeah I mean this plans to build extra something so the cool thing about what's happening and I showed in the video is that I'm going to be building a pit if you guys are lower the pizzas it's going to be a big hole

(Start: 00:05:02)
that'll be underneath the middle of the car where you park it and there will be some stairs you can go down it's going to be roughly about 1.8 meters deep and the width oh she don't remember there's about a meter and a half I think maybe a little bit less anyway so you can get underneath the car and do work on it so you'll park your car above you your walk down and down steps and you'll be able to look up and work on the call which is really cool so standing on doing this in the corporate area that isn't going to work anymore because there's drainage systems and also the stuff that I've found out on the plans so I'm going to be doing that in the garage so this single garage that I've got now we going to dig down and we in turn into cutter which is pretty cool now that that's going to enable me to do so much work especially on this car here in front it's such a mission to get those rx-7 and the sylvari exhibit onto jack stands and do work on it so when the pit is in I'll literally just drive

(Start: 00:06:02)
the car and crawl underneath and do work really cool it's going to be like a half size put so for me to do work on how to explain this if I park the car front facing all any be doing work in the engine bay engine area and Midway to the car but if I reverse it then I'll be able to do work in the back end up to the MIDI area so it's like a half-size putt so that's an update the next thing is why haven't I posted I've been under the weather again two weeks ago just after I opposed to the last video driving the rx-7 I'll end up getting something called gastro super sick I was just on the toilet most of the time so yeah and as crude on the toilet and then throwing up and I lost like four kilos just kicking him Caesar was horrible so I took a little bit of time off myself

(Start: 00:07:02)
then on Sunday my daughter started projectile vomiting now she's ten months old projectile vomiting and diarrhea and all that that's quite dangerous because I received admiration and hurt all fontanelle on top of your head if you also know that's little area that sinks in was rather sunken and wind born you cannot do a little test it see if this dehydration and of course there was dehydration and yeah we rushed it off the hospital we could see us and nausea sand falling over and we took word to your casualty or emergency room and they put in a drip and little vein blew up in a left hand so that's put it in a right hand and then they did a whole bunch of tests and they picked up the list gastric flu and they admitted her into the hospital she was in for two days and on a trip and it was just there was a horrible horrible time I mean it was everything was out of our control nothing we could do and she's she's a

(Start: 00:08:07)
lot better now she's not thinking of full bottles or anything but she is drinking which is good and we happy so I actually haven't even been on YouTube I think I've watched probably two youtube videos of other people's content I think one was like from roads untraveled and i think i watch the logan paul video i just haven't had time and whatever time i've had i've been looking after my daughter with my wife and just meaning good family time i posed to be in the house up and down trying to get building contractors sorted out and make sure the guys know what they're doing okay so that's a that's a place what's been happening my laughs I apologize for not uploading and Gaza is purely an update video we're just going to get the car across to the COR station I'm not going to film there and feel like asking people for Commission today so as soon as they finish telling us what's going on I'm cutting the video short the next thing is we almost at 2,000 subscribers now I never thought we would actually

(Start: 00:09:07)
get to the stage which is pretty cool so guys thank you so much I think we're on one nine five four one nine five three the last I checked give me a favor go find a video share the video or just randomly tell someone to subscribe I'd really appreciate if we can hit TK by the end of this pretty cool I know we've done it before we use again about 150 plus minus subscribers a month but as it stands and what uploading so frequently is going to start but I'm back and yeah the next thing is some of you guys ordered some stickers because WWll JDM Big Cartel calm I've got some merch that I've been selling guys whoever place orders for the stickers thank you so much because you're the first place in orders I've actually shipped you with both the Snickers I've already done that two days ago so we take about two weeks to come through to you I'm so sorry about the delays there's some footage is playing

(Start: 00:10:09)
right now and yeah I went through and drop this also cause you've got two stickers okay so I got a funny story to tell you guys about the r32 GTR and it was on Sunday it was just before my daughter actually got rushed to hospital and I decided let me take the GTR for the drive I don't increase that I didn't go crazy because the oil disc needs to be changed so it was just me on the car no cameras nothing I just I've decided to drive to the house and switch the alarm back on and took the car out there and now the driver is a bit of a funny one it's it's like a steep driver that goes down but there is a look for the rail of the gate and then it just kind of just drops right down and I've thought the cold care and I kind of made a huge noise coming in because well kind of a welcomed in your neighborhood something made a big noise coming in and

(Start: 00:11:11)
then I'll try to get into the driveway and I got stuck I started scratching the door for slow scratching but some quick sauce there was nothing I could do I already thought carrot and stupid move on my part anyway and no damage at all I got a nice the car cyclicals lot sketches managed to get the car back out in one piece didn't damage any bodywork and I'm happy any issues I need to redo the driveway at the top now so we weren't planning on that at all so now redoing that whole area which is fun I guess so if that cotton cleared the or exhibit not this one this one mark clear it because my heart would be so low on definitely not the silver rx-7 I'm still busy doing the licensing on it so the last video you got so I winded the way Bridge the car weight in one to six kilograms the data dotting happen with it sprayed at the spray thousand little

(Start: 00:12:12)
particles all over different places the cause and their marker dots where people can pick them up of no people the police or very dot by scanning the car they'll be able to find that okay this is the cars been stolen or later so that's done that below every single cost Everett the black ones got it ready watch job that was done on the black one but anyway it doesn't matter I've done my police current stuff I need to go hand it in so actually got all the paperwork here with me and I'm going to go hand it in today a little bit later and I'm Tom now but getting a hand it in and carry on with the registration of the car now the black one as I mentioned in the beginning of the video we've got all the paperwork now everything is ready and the car can be license on the road now the only issue is that they wouldn't accept the licensing because the car needs an up-to-date certificate of red wavy I'm sure you guys all know what that is I've been mentioning a couple videos those two via roadworthy is to

(Start: 00:13:13)
make sure the car drives perfectly there's now if there are oil leaks or water leaks anything like that and is the cost safe to be on our rides once we hand in those paper where the the simular Road movie we can get all the paperwork back to the car and we can start licensing putting it at my name etc and then just answer a couple questions a lot of you guys asked me in the previous video and the video before that why do I still have the black or x7 when I own the silver one and I've mentioned this when I was buying the silver one this black rx-7 is actually going across to my father however I cannot legally sell lease lend hire bla bla long list of stuff that our county for a period of two years from the data registration so it probably only have the registration done within the next at say two to three weeks once the registration is done the cause in my name and it stays my name for four years then my father's going to

(Start: 00:14:15)
take it on so that's also why is driving now he's getting to enjoy the car and in the present for the vehicle so I guess you can kind of drive it right now so another question of head is why this black one and you know it's a bit of a funny story with this black one but we were looking at auctions or ours look at auctions and I was bidding on specific cause specific gradings and I just wasn't winning the metal and I had a certain amount of money that I was playing in the auctions and I was getting close on winning some but I never won any and I decided okay let me just change my grading what I'm looking at for so started looking cause with like if the Energy's grading I think this one was D interior and the exterior the other way around but I never went for anything that was e or DD it was always had to be a C and E so sort of funny a couple cars and I started

(Start: 00:15:16)
putting some grading and sorry putting some bids on these cars and this was one of them and it was kind of a Russia they have to like 2:00 in the morning or 3:00 in the morning so this is a huge time difference here between South Africa and Japan and I'm put a bit down for this car and I forgot to check is it an automatic is it a manual rather because I went to the manual and I didn't really care about mileage and that sort of stuff law okay so I said no more than 130 thousand kilometers and this one was on the nine hundred and thirty thousand kilometers but I wanted to make sure it was semi stock and it was average now one thing I forgot to do at 2:00 in the morning was to take with us an automatic or not the next morning I woke up and I had a phone call from the Gaza border from Japan partner congratulations you won this car and on the car cool six outs that I actually put it on three or four black Oryx 7/3 lap and I can't

escape this to that I was like I was really stuck because well I won the damn car then later on they send me in the grading sheet and the auction numbers are like oh it's a keyless damn car anyway nothing wrong with that my dad digs at mom my dad spoke to me about a year ago or wouldn't actually him in a year yet he spoke to me a couple months ago just off his car landed and he said well he likes Doric 7 it says favorite New Age car because remember he collects really old cause 19 19 19 15 whatever model a Model T Dodge Brothers he collects all these really old cause and he turned around he surprised me he said he really loves in sirplease oryx Evans how does the process work and blah blah blah he'd like to he won't he once mon-sol said law yeah why don't we chat one and she

(Start: 00:17:22)
take on this thing and he likes his is already there and obviously he's he can take ownership of it for the next two years but he doesn't care because he doesn't even drive his cause he's he's got a whole bunch of collectors cars and all a dozen traveling so this was fun for him anyway long story short this car is going to be in my name for the next two years they often take over it and will probably get something out so well not probably as you guys know the deal I do want to collect a DM cause and I want to collect or 32 GTR or x7 I've already got I'd love to get an or 33 GTR just because listen is 15 Silvia I'd love to get one they aren't however collectors often since Africa yet they all one or two that are floating around and they are they've been brought in the different ways to bring them in anyway so they haven't been brought in this collective so if you go live in

(Start: 00:18:22)
Japan for a year you can legally bring any cause on is Ross and drove back and certificate even it's a brand-new car all live in America and bring a car across all is Ross Andhra right so that's how they are a couple is 15 is floating around so I'd love to give my hands one of those obviously TLC / Mach 4 I'd love to own one I'd love to own or 286s 13 is 14 and yeah or maybe in a couple years time get all those cars together that'll be very cool I'm going to do a Q&A video one of these days what I'll do is I'll do a giveaway at the same time so get me to 2,000 subscribers guys help me out let's get there I'll do a Q&A video straight after and who asked questions and stuff it'll be some prizes and stickers and some of my merch and some other stuff that I'll put together and giveaway so I did one of these that I think 500 subscribers and there are two winners one of you guys has been

Title: Driving my RX7 FD3S for the first time ever!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62ef46Wxnnw

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys welcome to the Vlog as you all know I'm going to be driving my silver Mazda RX7 type RS for the first time ever right now so I'm just busy doing the prep right now which is just putting the license thing on the back getting my GoPro ready putting my microphone in and I'm just going to quickly move the cars because there's cars in the way and I need reshuffle because the painters are here and blah blah blah so anyway we're going to take the car through like I mentioned in the previous video I'm going to be doing a couple things one of which will be the way Bridge the next one will be the data dotting and then if I have time I'm going to be doing the certificate of Road worthy for the vehicle okay let's go take a look at the car okay so here we are pretty much everything is ready I just want to quickly take off all this  on here permits on the back microphone is set up ready and waiting for me and my GoPro okay so I'm quickly going to

(Start: 00:01:01)
shuffle these cars back around and then I'm going to start it up and move before we do any of that I'm going to try and take off some of the stuff on the wind screen okay guys we are inside the Mazda RX7 top RS hopeing you can hear me okay I've got this little microphone clipped onto me just finished moving all the cars around so I've already warmed up the car it's sitting on 89° it's done its whole AO sockle it was sitting at about 1,000 600 RPM for a little while probably about 7 8 minutes and then it's come down now to about 950 so that's going quite nasty I'm going to make a quick pit stop and I'm going to put some fuel in the car so far so good we got that stupid airon pulley back on so it's making a little bit of a whining bearing noise I don't know if you guys can hear that over the m

(Start: 00:02:01)
microphone gear changes are really smooth nice short shifter so the gear ratio on this particular car the type RS is a lot different to the standard RX7 it's a lot shorter I'm not exactly sure what the gear ratio is offand but does feel great clutch feels really good guys this is a first time I'm actually talking and driving and talking to you guys about the car so bear with me I'm also a little bit nervous driving this damn thing I don't know anything about this car and its characteristics and problems Etc so might be a little bit of a shitty review if you can even call it a review my seat positioning is definitely an issue I'm as far back as you can go go and arms are really

(Start: 00:03:03)
bent I'd like to move the back of the seat oh there we go okay now I'm lying down a bit too much this is probably as best as I can do definitely as far back as I can go I'm not tallest of people um 1.7 6 M uh I think that's 5' 7 the car is still sitting at 89° Celsius for water temp that's really good definitely going to have to do wheel alignment the car's pulling a little bit to the left hopefully it's nothing serious there's a small clunking noise in the rear of the car summing suspension wise I did take a look at the Top Nut they are tight um slight clinking it's it's

(Start: 00:04:03)
probably just worn bushes somewhere I'm going have to climb underneath the car and take a look at that all of that that AC bearing that's gone is driving me nuts already I probably should have disconnected the py for the Tom being anyway so we've done a total of 3.5 km so far car feels good doesn't feel like it's going to explode awesome news now I don't know how much you guys can see on the GoPro I set it all the way behind me but there's a lot of people that are walking past and they're all stopping or at least staring at the car this is not something that you see on our road very often

(Start: 00:05:10)
I just hit the boost a little bit there I believe the second turbo kicks sitting at about 42,000 RPM I don't have a boost gauge in the car yet just yet but you guys know I bought some already idiot let's give it a little bit of a g first gear power deliver is very smooth very linear first gear pull obviously there's no justice to this car second cure gave it a little bit of gas there no disrespect to this car I mean I still love it this is one of my dream cars from in house a little bit I think the sequential turbo setup is

(Start: 00:06:11)
 obviously I've I've driven the black car it's got the sequential turbo on that but it isn't automatic so you feel the surge at about 44 4,500 RPM and it's not a massive kick where you go oh wow okay second turbo it kind of comes in and then it lulls a bit and then you feel a little bit of a surge of additional power nothing to write home about at all and it's a bit different with the auto because it cuts off and at 7,000 RPM I believe these cars they really scream up to about 81 I think that's my rev limit now I'm not going to thrash it to 81 today cuz this is the first time I'm driving it and I'd like to finish my Licensing in one piece but

(Start: 00:07:19)
yeah okay we are back on the road I just thrown in about $20 of fuel cuz I want the test to be as close as possible to the car being empty and that should be enough for the day anyway got this definitely a big kick when that second server comes in on this car which is pretty cool so that's 4,000 then 4

(Start: 00:08:21)
and 1 half let's try the again quick 4,000 4 and a half bang second turbo car feels fantastic that's actually really really impressive I had my doubts earlier before I went and filled fuel to be honest that small turbo doesn't quite have that Grunt and just coming from a turbocharge and this in Juke I know it's absolutely no comparison but the turbocharge in the S Juke has 140 KW which is just Shar about 200 horsepower and the power delivery comes in at about 3,000 RPM and it's relatively strong throughout the ra range or let's say up until maybe about 5 and 1 half 6,000 RPM if I'm lucky this feels really good when I hit [Music]

(Start: 00:09:28)
45 let's go again second gear 3 and 1 half th000 nothing nothing nothing 4,000 here's the second T okay so I boost it about three times here let's check out the water temp still waiting for this a magic holder to arrive and it's going to set up about here car is considering 94° what a temp that's still okay I believe anything over the 100 Mark is a little bit of a worry I'm going to open the windows a bit because the AC knob is broken again

(Start: 00:11:29)
hoping you guys can hear me okay with the windows open I'm hoping there's not a lot of wind noise but I just drive the car through this little Back Road a little bit of a twisty I didn't go too fast the car feels great it really inspires conference I mean if I had to compare this to my GTR I think I'd feel a lot safer going through corners in this car than my R32 GTR and I can't explain why just yet because I haven't driven it long enough but I'm yet for this one to kick its butt out on me but I mean just going in low speeds it just it feels like it's inspiring confidence and wants me to just Flor it through these Corners so first thoughts on driving the RX7 it's a great car the small turbo doesn't feel like it has enough power when the second turbo kicks in it is fantastic the handling is phenomenal low centri gravity

(Start: 00:12:29)
decent enough power good handling makes an absolute dream of a sports car I'm really strike with this guys you probably can't see the front of my face through the rear view miror maybe you can I don't know but I'm pretty much smarting the whole way this is this is really cool I'm just going back to my R32 GTR comment it probably inspires less confidence the R32 that is because of the high cast every now and again my little high cast light comes in you can feel the Hydraulics kicking in and trying to throw the back of the car out or do little adjustments that are absolutely useless so we just come into the industrial area now

(Start: 00:13:29)
the way bridge is somewhere down here I did it with the black car a couple months ago uh it is somewhere on the left hand side I think this car would do great with a little bit of a smaller steering wheel give me a lot more control but as it stands really good I think it's this no this one how is it man what it I'm wanting to weigh the car for the W Bridge oh yeah can I go straight on the ramp I'll wait you okay guys I'm going to get this car weighed and I'll must I go onto the ramp oh okay okay

(Start: 00:14:32)
[Music] okay guys just finished up with the w bridge and the car weighed in at 1260 right so w Bridges over car weigh in at 1260 okay so step one of this process is over that was the W Bridge car weighed in at 1260 kgs it's a really light car which is awesome I'm not sure what it's supposed to weigh standard but I know the black

(Start: 00:15:32)
RX7 being an automatic that weighed in I think it was 135 so almost 100 100 kgs heavier than what this is sorry I don't know what it is in pounds um but I'll Splash it on the screen right now I'm going to go pull over somewhere that I know and I'm not going to get stabbed and I'm going to take out my phone and I'm going to put on Google Maps I need to figure out where to go for the next place check my apexi while we're going okay car is sitting at 101° so let's not boost it now for a stock car it actually sounds pretty good and there's nothing done to it at all it's completely standard it's got a voltage stabilizer I mean that's not even a mod but stock exhaust stock induction and you can actually you can hear those turbos

(Start: 00:16:32)
coming I'm pretty happy I'm definitely going to be moving those HKS power flow super power flows across from the black car into this one that's going to give it a nice little sounding induction and then I've got that HKS exhaust that I'm going to throw on here cuz a good enough place to stop okay while I'm sitting here waiting for my phone to get off black and white mode um water temper has dropped now from 101 down to 93 just being idle for a little bit it's pretty good okay apparently we're not far we are 3 and 1/2 km away 7 Minutes Drive well that kind of worked sort of that's holding up my

(Start: 00:17:35)
GPS while I've got all you guys' attention links in the description I've got new stickers that are out showed you guys in the last video yesterday if you want to buy them they are on nkel jm. bigcartel.com for

(Start: 00:18:38)
okay guys that was about an hour or so uh just finished is always got to talk when I talk right I was saying uh it's been about an hour or so I've just had the car very doted data dotted so I was wondering a little bit of earlier why I had a bit of a lack of power I kept very quiet uh right at the end just before I got here but I had a I had a lack of power the car kind of felt like a normally aspirated vehicle but it was still driving and driving fine when I got to the very dot place I open up the Bonnet and cloth stuff for uh sound deadening on the Bonnet that had all frayed and kind of melted onto this truck brace so I peeled all of that off I don't have any tools here I've got the basic tools but I kind of need like a big fork type thing to take this take the sound deadening off the car and well didn't have it with me so I just kind of ripped it and anyway when when I open up

(Start: 00:19:39)
the Bonnet I saw this so I pulled all that off then the second thing I noticed is that the Boost pop had popped off and the car felt like a normally aspirator car so the Boost pop that I got on there it's this makeshift thing cuz it was broken from the time when the car arrived and I just put some t-bolt clamps on it trying to hold it together and clearly not working cuz it popped off pretty sure that boost pop has popped off again cuz I'm flooring it and I've got no power at all damn it okay so I'm just going to po home uh guys I'm going to end the video here it's it's a little bit of a little bit of a shitty drive I'm going to open up my windows get rid of this microphone and I will catch you guys back at the

(Start: 00:20:42)
[Music] house a bit [Music] sweet [Music] my that was a interesting drive to say the least so after I turn off the GoPro I actually ended up going back home to my house where the GTR is cocked because I saw a little bit of smoke coming out of the Bonnet I'll show you guys what there was that sound deadening thing that was here now it's a two layer thing the first

(Start: 00:21:44)
layer is like this uh I don't even know what it is like anyway it's like this stupid like mutton cloth and then the second layer is like this black very fine cloth now the black very fine cloth got stuck all over here and melted all over the strut bra that I've painted twice now anyway I pulled off the black stuff when I was at the data dotting place and then I thought it'll be fine but uh after I switched off the GoPro got a smelly a little bit of uh burning smell a little bit of smoke tiny little Pluff of smoke and luckily I was just down the road from where my actual house is pulled over and the sound deading was just boiling hot it wasn't on fire or anything um it was just giving off a little bit of smoke but it was basically catching off the top of the uim and just cooking getting really hot and it started melting I mean it is old it's 20 years old this year this a 1997 and then the irritating part is the stupid boost

(Start: 00:22:44)
PP popped off twice so this is a makeshift story I do need to make something up and I need to make something up ently I figure this would have held up just for today clearly not so I've got some work to do on the car second thing thing is this uh bearing is driving me nuts the noise is crazy on there so number one I need to make up a new pop for here that I can sort out bearing needs to be replaced on this or remove the entire air conditioning pulley which I'm probably going to do remove the entire air conditioning the third thing and the last thing is there's a bush in the back of the rear suspension that is going actually it's just gone and it needs to be replaced so there's a bit of a clunking sound coming from the rear left okay that's awesome so my little thingy just broke clean off the camera anyway guys I'm going to end off the Vlog about here here's the black RX7 if you guys would want to see so with regards to the drive itself it was pretty good until the Boost P popped off the car feels phenomenal around corners

(Start: 00:23:46)
the handling is superb I'm actually really surprised due to the fact that it's a rear wheeel drive car but it's so planted so well focused around corners you can actually feel everything the car is giving you so much feedback through the steering wheel it is insane I did not expect that now I didn't drive this car hard the black one I was just Driving Miss Daisy the silver one is a different story then the boost power popped off the car felt like a normally aspirated piece of and I drove it to the place realized the Boost PP was off I thought it was actually somebody else um cuz I didn't hear any popping or anything and the car still had low down torque not much but I still had some talk so I thought something else was wrong and I kept very quiet during the drive until I got to the place fixed the boot pop or at least I thought I did um with the tools that I had with me and then I drove and then obviously boost pop or the clamp shot off a little bit and it's leaking and either way the car still feels pretty damn good I mean it's standard 206 KW decent power I'm I'm very impressed

(Start: 00:24:46)
for what it is and how light the car is it's 1260 kgs with that power to weight ratio the car is insane to drive I can only imagine what a single turbo or a decently modified twin turbo can feel like Ian I'm going to move the stuff from here there's the HK super power flow intakes that are on this black car I'm going to get a full exhaust made up with the HG back box that I've got and a few minor mods here and there and it'll bump the power up by a couple Kow and I'm pretty sure the car is going to sound and go once that's done anyway guys sorry if it was a bit of a strange drive I'm not used to the whole talking and driving thing so I was actually stumbling for words just mainly concentrating on my drive also I didn't know where the two places were so I was kind of lost I wish you all the best for the weekend hope you enjoy and I'll see you all next time guys I just ended the Vlog um and I just noticed something the freaking tail PP thing

(Start: 00:25:49)
burst off the exhaust see it's all rusted and damag damn so it looks like I definitely have to throw that HKS exhaust on sooner than later Monday my shy earn and Tuesday it's ocean blue 28 sit over you Ferrari drops and R sit them out tvsp right oh

(Start: 00:01:03)
so before we continue I am in the garage with the GTR it's still properly filthy but I just quickly ran some water across here and microfiber cloth this cloth was brand new before I used it on the Bonnet and it's all you need to do I mean lot of you guys may not know this if you are new here but this is actually plastic dip and it is a damn good job good Bonet still open but yeah that's supposed to be flush see there's all the dirt on the car clean obviously not what I would really do in a show and shine or actually just taking out during the day but yeah it's that it's that easy if you've got plastic up you just throw a little bit of water microfiber cloth if you want throw some car wash liquid on it and that'll kind of help so obviously I don't do this this is the first time I've actually done this with the water I mean the car has been sitting for so long obviously you guys

(Start: 00:02:04)
know I've been busy there's been a lot going on in my life right now but I'm trying to get things back on track I'm starting to do these multiple uploads again I'm sure you dud are happy about that we did three uploads this week which is a record for the last let's say month 2 months maybe so I've got some exciting news for you guys so the first bit of exciting news I've got paperwork I have the final bit of paperwork need to last my black RX7 with this paperwork I can now do the final registration on the car so that's the last piece of the puzzle I can start licensing the car which is fantastic news Okay so that is good news number one so number two by the time you guys are watching this tomorrow I would have by the time you guys are watching this Vlog I would have already driven my silver RX7 for the first time ever I've got my temporary permit so this means that I can legally drive the car on the road up until that day the 24th so Monday I'm obviously going to be filming I'm going

(Start: 00:03:05)
to be setting up my GoPro I've got my little Nifty microphone thingy which is inside here somewhere taped over there by the intake so I'm not going to set the microphone up for induction noise or anything I'm just going to set up the microphone right over here and I'm going to talk to you guys through the drive let you know what it feels like obviously it's going to be the first time for me driving the RX7 which is crazy I've been waiting for so long to get to drive this car properly on the road you guys have followed me through all the hearttech trying to get this car started finally figuring out that the ECU had an issue replacing it with apexi power FC doing the service the oil change all that sort of stuff and now the car is finally ready to get on the road so the reason why I got a tempor permit to drive it is because I need to go do a couple things one of which is a police clearance they need to have a look at the car match the chassis number the engine number make sure it's exactly what's on the paperwork clear me so I can take it back to the licensing department I'm also going to be doing my data dotting or

(Start: 00:04:06)
vary dotting now that's a system that they spray on the car underneath the chassis and the engine bay on the engine some interior parts it's an invisible spray and it's got micro dots so they can trace the vehicle if it does get stolen the other thing I'm going to be doing is taking the car through to the W bridge now you guys saw the wave Bridge with the black RX7 basically put the car on the ramps they weigh the car tell you what the weight is okay guys that being said I have something very very cool and I want to show you guys so this has been a long time coming a long time in the making and I've tried different designs and I haven't really been happy with the whole thing but I finally have some merch so what we have here is my first piece of [Music] merch so this one here is going to be going on my car right now it's got my YouTube logo now called JDM Godzilla hand obviously Godzilla because of this

Title: Why Did I Buy An Apexi Power FC for the RX7 FD?
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0W7RMmp53Q

(Start: 00:00:00)
sup guys and welcome to the vlog we are with the ORAC Civic so lost not I managed to get out with the off 80 GTR described it around a little bit was a little bit of a fail video because I rushed it I had about + - an hour and a half and the battery was completely flat in the cost of cost charged it and I got onto the red wasn't too happy of the audio i rats of 5 meter cable one of my subscribers video valets gatito's channel he pointed out that there's quite a bit of loss when you use a long cable so it's quite a high quality my friend that I've got it does sound great when I don't use a long cable there just sounded horrible yesterday if I might do with some settings that I had in Adobe Premiere and I did some adaptive noise stuff and it sort of sound a little bit better but still not what I want anyway

(Start: 00:01:02)
while we're here I'm here with rx-7 and it's been a little while so I just want to start it up boring video I know but at least you guys get to see the car who got all this rubbish outta me take off I just have no time whatsoever yeah just need to come in with some cleaners or some nail polish remover and it'll come off quickly cause Bertha sitting outside in this position for quite a while the reason why it's moved down here is because the house is getting repainted so as you can see over there they're busy painting the whole outside of the place affect them a couple weeks you did

(Start: 00:02:06)
bit of a tart fit we in hospital smells like cigarettes a hit vacuum it and put on some air fresheners and stuff but okay then I'll show you guys a little bit more about this apex power FC [Music] startup okay well good okay so first of all what is the pixie piracy and why did I buy it and what can I do so this is the hand controller for the unit the FX e piracy sits down there that's with the standard EC sits and it's kind of into this old compartment now it doesn't have brackets like the standard ECU services double-sided tape but that's good enough it's held it now the hand controller is an optional extra thus allows you to control certain settings and monitor what's happening

(Start: 00:03:07)
with the ECU now there is something called NFC data logger which plugs in directly into the ECU I think it uses the same port as this the vast and be able to plug it into your laptop and you're able to look at all sorts parameters change stuff and change things much easier than you will be able to you're on this unit so let's take a quick look into what does can do so the first option is monitor now you allow different channels in here so the first one you'll just be able to one specific sensor basically so here's all your different senses injector duty cycle ignition leading trailing sit sir engine revs so let's look at engine revs engines revving at just under a thousand injector duty cycle five point five five point four percent negative six degrees timing on the leading plug negative fourteen on trailing plug vehicle speeds Eric's and

setting stop beast now these will knock levels they don't show you a value gets a to channel is basically if I want to see two different figures so for example it's set to engine Rev I can make that speed and then let's go I can change that to battery voltage for example now I can see two different figures or two different values in your vehicle speed and my battery voltage occurs pretty stupid one I would never do that but you get the idea and then for channel a channel etc so a channel same story you can see eight different figures all on the screen so now this is pretty handy obviously this would set something like here I do have a hold on its way thanks to all of our subscribers he's gifting

(Start: 00:05:10)
me one of these are magic holders we'll talk about that when I'm actually around but it'll set basically some over here and I'll be able to see while I'm driving inject the GT cycle and also sort of English in lead trailing see this thing 25 degrees 24 degrees because literally monitors okay then there's a map tracer now this gives you a 20 by 20 V of your map and when you're driving or exhilarating see that I just have to accelerate a bit and just different things now I'm not exactly entirely sure how to read this right now now the settings menu I'm going to be very careful he playing in here so now here's your ignition map for your leading plugs so you can basically go in

(Start: 00:06:12)
here and adjust all the parameters and you've got a 20 by 20 map now you can any work 505 on the screen the Alvin scrolling if want to get that file again let's go across however when you plug your laptop and you've got a full 20 by 20 and you can adjust and you can shift and click and you can read everything and much quicker than anything valuable ok so that's that a PRN voltage you're not exactly sure that's not entirely but injectors so you can see here my primary injectors with a 50 CCS secondary late 50s so you can change these values here as to what they are and then obviously change all the settings and the delight arm only on the firing of the injector etc boost so the first base option is 0.8 and 0.7 for the secondaries you can turn it up I'm not sure if you do turn

(Start: 00:07:14)
it up or if you do set it to that option if it adjusts the rest of the map values this is a preset here I'm going to leave it what are the standard so acceleration vision inject the Tom now I'm not Athena I'm still learning and I don't want to cut my teeth on this car I will be learning on GTR and your girl in some way run I did try tuning a little bit of my one series that I had also had in a pixie power of C and then dabbled in the open source tuning like literally a couple hours and then gave it up and had a mate did for me and then here's all your elements and stuffs rave lemons $8,100 that is if C maybe feel cut I don't know

(Start: 00:08:16)
actually don't know but II L I think is electrical load that's air conditioning a er donor so our dough with electrical load so I'm guessing at idle with air conditioning on or lots or radio etc idle of the AC on is 907 20 is a II when I cause I think on our ceiling just about a thousand and there at the ECC menu now and here you can see what version you're running on the program I think this is the latest version of the commander since the check you can see what all the sensors a day that's pretty cool you can sit sequential servers inject the warnings knock warnings in turn on and off oxygen sensor control and then

(Start: 00:09:17)
you can adjust the brightness on this and then all data in it that is resetting your ECU obviously I want to do that now I'm still busy relearning my idle but yeah that's my a pixie power FC in a nutshell so I'm going to flashback to some footage from Bayon when years here with the FC hacker plugged into this rx-7 and he kind of just explains a little bit about water kandi and waters on the screen I bet lemon and Tom and I actually chose to cut that from the video previously because it was the startup and getting the car running for the first time ever and don't want to get a technical I just want to show you these the car was running they've got the injector math car [Music] if our ratio look you've been filling crews area all the way up to five rich anymore about ten and a half I was getting coulombs good

(Start: 00:10:18)
rgl math 93 are leading and trailing this is the ignition leading that because 20 degrees I don't know what it's supposed to be 402 celebrities and others were and then you're trailing matches understand the trailing map lonely like Obama okay okay power log this is the mass of the member here's a map of degrees of advance for your your rpm along the top axis and your load points on the y-axis L and the took the space map will be your also got to do a ceiling that you don't have an excuse efficiency didn't inject them aperture obvious you've got two thefts of injectors as well as primary low so this so those two maps will have something through those two up on that okay stating to our rev limit yeah there's all in there sequential silver control injector warning control not

(Start: 00:11:19)
wanting to feedback control at all ignition control the idle ignition control of it just the optimum with the timing agent booth sitting to your first server where a bar involved your comfort to tip maps or something interesting to the transition so you can get the transition point our business is 97 the injector warning when you inject get to 98% through the cycle it'll warn you when you're not get fifty percent or fifty sixty unit the unit with reading then it then it'll warn you I'm not sure how to warn you but I'm assuming something on the dash will flash injector correction why would that be okay what a correction okay there's going to be two I think it's just you're fueling based on the water temperature this is your septum adjustment to accelerate that think

(Start: 00:12:19)
that's it then when you when you partial throttle midway through and you tip them to full throttle how much extra fuel that doesn't wellbore yeah and a fungal last thing you're doing each other yeah that's that fine Chiquita yeah yeah if you tear one of them or at all [Applause] and then oh yeah so when you rivet it comes into the I was going to do a Prada listen fabulous we hold it a little bit higher by account so lengthen out of the not fine because that's it from me hope you enjoy the video and you've got a little more insight into what they pixie piracy can actually do now the reason why I bought it and I forgot to mention is because it was a little bit cheaper than going for another neck and obviously

(Start: 00:13:19)
another makes careful would be a DAP tronic or there'll be a hell tech unit Microtech is great for these cars but I wasn't a bit of a budget I had roughly about fifteen thousand rand which is about $1200 plus $1,300 i'il now I'm doing house renovations and a lot of stuff that money's little bit tight this is why wait for they pixie piracy it is a great ICI nothing against it but there are newer more advanced options anyways stuff that I don't really need and like I said I don't know where I'm going with this clock and which sells easy lasers that I needed anymore outcry and etc so guys that's it for the video hope you enjoyed and I will see you all next time [Music]

(Start: 00:00:00)
what up boys welcome to the vlog bet you guys didn't think you'd be back in this cesspool they called my GTR garage and we back as my GTR filthy as fog just take a look at this I haven't been in here again in four weeks this will add us because like a fiddler from some  doesn't put plastic covers when they built the Scourge so I've been gone for a little bit off but not for about a week or so it's with unusual because I generally post about a week every week plus - yeah anyway that didn't happen I didn't get to post I've been busy sample showed I'm not going to bore you guys with it I've been busy of the house of and sick again remember I said I wasn't going to get sick and in a worked outside in the most and the G on the rx-7 cancer with the cause come from all the Jude not is not so this shit's all going on my back of my neck while I'm working fun stuff well I got laryngitis and I lost my voice anyway I'm back I

(Start: 00:01:01)
can talk now which is awesome still on antibiotics and let say I'm carrying on and what we're going to do today is just something very simple and that is driving this car now I haven't driven my off 32 teeth in a while a long drive it was about four or five weeks ago and it was a bit of a boring Grove's didn't do much this is going to be the last time I drove the car without doing the oil change so if it takes six weeks to the oil change side beer I'm driving this car now in its desi state [Music] so one thing I haven't told you did is I bought this five meter cable and it's just three mini jack cable I got my

(Start: 00:02:04)
GoPro here I'm a little pilot hole over here and I'm going to make this little bit bigger so that that can essentially fit in there and I'm going to hook up a microphone somewhere in here so I'll end up buying some expensive it's called a olympus something market friend it's sitting on the seat day in the darkness and like over the expense with one of those little clip-on microphones i'm going to put it somewhere here i don't know how much i get the best engine sales possible so I'm probably gonna topple this a little bit kick Beatty and pure engine sound or b-26 some like that anyway good news is one of you guys have been complaining shows the RTT some love I don't know if this is love or hate but I'm going to be thrashing out on some pretty old oil maybe I won't Trisha I don't know let's see what happens so I'm just gonna drive the car it's holidays

(Start: 00:03:06)
at the moment or vacation already guys call it the rights of busy there's been a lot of roadblock so I'm not going to overdo it I'm going to boost the 1/2 plus 3/4 ton zone we'll see how it goes so I'm not going to bore you with this whole dremel story and making this whole bigger we're going to climb straight into it I'm probably gonna mount this camera we are now to the front show somewhere maybe other they bang right there if you can see all the feet come on in now doubtful ok what you looking at down there is little suction cuppy thing and it's got the little screw for the camera so I'm going to mount my vlogging camera to here hopefully it's not let me to you shake you whatever all pre-fitted it out anyway go probably my usual spot right at the end over there and that will give me the whole cabin view and I'm going to do a little bit of driving so guys I'm sorry the boring video I'm sorry if you guys or except and fan and you came here to

(Start: 00:04:07)

Title: RX7 FD Type RS Road Prep
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wKenLshGFA

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] hey guys welcome to the vlog somehow I managed to delete the intro that I made last night when I came in to do the service on the rx-7 so a quick recap and what actually happened last night it was late it was dark there was a lot of joy and it was mist around the area and I was working outside camera kept steaming up later in the vlog so please forgive me for that one I managed to do quite a bit on the car one of which was obviously the oil change I put all the pieces back together and I managed to get a big sea power FC Ardell sorted so you can actually see the car in the background and you can hear the car right now if I'd link normally it's sitting at about 900 rpm so I've done all the sparkles etc and I've also sort out the belt that's come up next before we carry on

(Start: 00:01:01)
at the blog I just want to thank all you guys who came out to my last video and we're commenting nice things and just giving me some support what is okay we took it for a second opinion with the different pediatrician and put on different meds and she's been doing a lot better so guys thank you so much for the support let's carry on with the vlog I'll taking a quick look I'm actually just going to jack it up on the other side put one jack stand in and we should be good to go okay I'm good to go jack is in ahead of jack stand underneath there holding up the car let's set up a little oil catch thingy and I'm gonna drain the oil and one thing I forgot to mention to you dudes I have got a power steering belt because the aircon bearing is making some noise or I've got a smaller belt it's a nine one five six rib or six pk9 one five millimeter I guess I'm going to be changing that after I do all of this make sure the car is running I can drive

(Start: 00:02:01)
it I can wheel properly all that goodness the day of decide not to wear gloves okay guys while I wait for the oil to drain I'm going to take off the filter and change that but first while everything's out in the open we'll follow the guide that I found on internet it's on the or exceeded Club so there's a little hole for the adjustment screw so I'm going to download all the way back and then it is either do a quarter or half way so I'm going to go about a quarter then I can start the whole procedure again my autocorrect so what you do take a flat screwdriver you put it in the hole turn clockwise until it's fully taut and then dial it back about a quarter now I'm going to take this car and then I'm going to start putting everything back together so if

(Start: 00:03:02)
you're an like me and forgot to bring your little tool to take off oil filters you can use a hammer and a screwdriver jammed it on one side and now I'm just going to put some force in on my bullet that should in theory take out the oil filter come on a couple more holes than I anticipated but yeah it's the least now that's a little trick if you guys didn't know that I'm pretty sure you all did smash up the hammer and a screwdriver now I'm gonna be this wolf cam because sort of messy go know how much she'd is actually going to be able to still make that mark she cut this from the video but I'm just going to put my son plug and washer back in fasten it and then I'm going to fill it up it will okay some plug and washer and next thing I'm

(Start: 00:04:03)
going to do is I'm gonna stop being the oil in but first oil filter needs to go in so I'll just clean up my little funnel I just need to tell you dudes there is a noisy kid here the gardener's child that's screaming for its mother Piemonte hairs in the background a little bit like that so what you want to do is you want to take a little bit of the oil is here and just drop a little bit inside and then just put a little bit over the rubber here so the reasoning for that and I had a question before this on I think the black or x7 oil change why did I do it the reasoning is when you lock it it's going to get quite hard to remove so if you don't put oil on here it's going to lock up see if you a little bit of oil in here so I'm just going to leave this wheel onto the rubber okay it's going to take this oil filter and put it back on the car so I asked my dad what all these cars take

(Start: 00:05:09)
you guys probably can't see on the camera right now but all you need to do is just hand tighten the sky and once it builds up with heat it's going to tighten itself up okay that's about as tight as I can go because in the sea in the beginning I'm using Castrol GTX 2050 now this is multi mineral buh-ba-ba-bah this is mineral oil a multi grade mineral oil so it's recommended for these rx-7 FDS especially with a standard writer so they're not bridge Porter they're not anything no street ports is just completely stock from what I know drop the oil in I'm going to throw in roughly about just over four liters I'll show how much that is in quarts by Monday about four liters

(Start: 00:06:11)
now and then top it up as we go how's that oil that I'm using Castrol GTX and leave a check for now see I've got just under a liter left and I'll start sizing up and then I'll just check my oil consumption after startup and stuff ok cool the next thing I'm going to do is I'll put this intake piece back on see the nuts for the top are different to the ones for the bottom so these ones look a little rounded tip on it and the nuts are for the bottom but I can that I will no fear the works almost caught before drop them and lost them order

(Start: 00:07:11)
them as the awakener if you guys remember but and one of my first episodes with this car I've got a booklet which any noxious aid is with every single bit of history on this car full service history which cool super handy as well obviously it's all in Japanese but there's pretty pictures and stuff and you can kind of make out exactly what the guys did Jane at service ok the subs on next just kind of total list make sure this is cool and then we know do that other piece that guys everyday is I'm actually going to do this off cam it's kind of dark I want to get this caught in ground and get some lot and maybe move it into the garage just remember something while I was working I got to pull up a spot that slips over there because I need to do the power steering belt thingy

(Start: 00:08:15)
so I drop the car quickly I'm going to throw the power-steering belt on and then carry on with my life a stupid jack I'm very forgiving psychologist drops oh jesus that face carry it on I carry on do the of camp then we're putting the standard AC belt and power steering belt back on the car because I couldn't get this metal any some power tool a tools remove the ship no stand left on now so I've taught that up to speak and I'm going to start up the car the minute you stop by all these pops backing you can

(Start: 00:09:16)
see my cameras on the stood up knocker is pretty damn cold and working outside chances are it's IKEA alright i'm back together everything's back in camera still foggy corstel up yes good is he now concealed with the cars come from old ejoute not is not so this shuttle going on my back of my neck while I'm working fun stuff [Applause] oops I'm ready stop his car he resurfaced this year [Music]

(Start: 00:10:16)
oh okay I'm gonna go down to EGC next [Music] all data and that's yes can our cyclist [Music] and the book okay let's stop the car [Music] also the deal now inserted up a ten minute on normal auto then ten minutes with the d mr on and in ten minutes of the air conditioning

(Start: 00:11:18)
[Music] what were you doing my little Idol sit-up thingy let's go take a look at the black car [Music] Drako blood is talking blood gangsta's [Music] [Music] I'm pretty sweet forward of it [Music] okay guys I'm gonna end the vlog Raj

(Start: 00:12:18)
here I'm going to carry on I've just done the idol setup I'm on my last tip now so the first step was the normal Idol for about a minute then the second one of the tenets it's the D muster for another ten minute and now I'm on the air conditioning so my idol was about 900 then I was about 1 1 and now it's just over 950 plus minus with the ACI so I'm pretty happy everything seems to be working fine my idol sorted and then my will change topped it up we good to go because I'm at the end of LA grunta sorry for the boring one it was dark it was heck the guys under pressure so hopefully the next one's a little bit better if you did on subscribe the channel and you enjoy seeing Oryx Evans GTRs etc I've got those and I'll work on them and I'm planning on racing them in the future the girls hit that subscribe button hit that like button and fuzzy the radio on the channel thank you so much for being here with me and I'll see you all next time what a mistake it hurt in Tuesday at Dobson blue 28 fit overs you probably

Title: New Garage tour, Working on my RX7, Emergency Room
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2m3_TVWnN8

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] [Music] morning guys and welcome to the vlog I'm still a little bit under the weather it's freezing cold here I'm here to go work in the house I'm going to be making burglar guards welding again so every weekend from probably the next three weekends I'm welding burglar guards and welding gates for the new house like I said in the last vlog it's a lot cheaper to do this myself then get someone else in charge while I'm there I've got a little bit of dead time so I'll take some parts from the rx-7 I made a little video about a lot of stuff and I've been taking a few parts from my silver exhibit and doing a little bit of work when I get about an hour or so again okay so we're quickly you're just going to take the pot off the ORAC sevens but I've got some tools

(Start: 00:01:02)
inside this garage here ah man still sick as a dog so I actually got better during the week after that blog spoke to you guys in the comment section or that I did get a lot better actually I was fun and then passed it on to my daughter she's now got pharyngitis we're in the hospital yesterday she's back home now which is great so she's only 9 months old if you guys are wondering so we're a couple sleep is not young baby and I'm sick again vicious circle anyway no rest for the wicked I'm carrying on

(Start: 00:02:13)
okay I've decided I'm going to take this pup with me this is one of the possible in Secutor that's going to come with me and this one something about polishing these two so taking this off making the silver polishing and then uim polishing at some stage I've also got that strut brace let me show you guys with you did sorry about this nothing and stuff rather annoying for myself and control for you guys but I'm Archie I'm gonna make a blog the other stress brace that I was painting I'm gonna be color coding the engine by purple purple and black is going to look something like that she's pretty cool I remember I might be changing all these houses to purple I've got radiator hoses little purple these going to change the purple less and look pretty epic once it's done you do is let me know what you think in the comments section about the purple color scheme

(Start: 00:03:19)
it's just a rather my old man's work I'm going to be starting to polish buscar for available tools and power tools do they all this sort of [ __ ] so are you polishing that but before we start that I might be spray-painting some burglar bars that we just think painted here's an example of the gates that we've been building the burglar bars these are zinc plated see that so we're making I think 1315 somewhere around there of these just to show you guys quickly I'm redoing this because I wasn't happy with the finish so I'm busy premiering again painting standing it down painting citrus while I'm waiting for these to dry I'm going to be hand sending this because I don't live in areas because people will steal my stuff [Music]

(Start: 00:04:22)
we first cost by hand taken me quite a while but I need to stay here qualified for these to get stolen okay I just waiting for the final coat to dry on these guys and they good to go and here's my second possible hand okay guys just a quick update it's been a long morning and a long afternoon of making burglar bars zinc plating sanding painting doing all that sort of stuff they're looking really good which is cool but I've let much time to work on my carport stuff it's been busy for us here's what I did be so repainted this entire thing sanded it down thank the nose sand it again painted it that a couple coats or Pramod and then painted anyway this is the color scheme I would

(Start: 00:05:23)
show you guys in the beginning video and I think it's gonna be pretty cool ran out of time to do this I realized this was actually plastic so I don't know what the rx-7 dudes if you guys using a stock piece each cast is spread or what he do this I ran it across with the troll with that little bit that was taking better than polishing whatever you may call it a CSUN there's a couple little flip marks from the original so I've only done one pass or spin about ten post- minutes not a lot of time this will take hours to do and that's going to come right now anyway so it's been a boring day of just regular college and doing this stuff so I'm actually going to skip three or four tomorrow when I go back to the house and I'll flip these parts onto the car quick [Music]

(Start: 00:06:25)
we had to go to the hospital and we went through think we left home probably but call it to necessary dose quality three in the morning but we left went through the hospital took my daughter there because she's got something called pharyngitis threatens all flared up and read and saw and she can't swallow and while she's sleeping and lying down she's building up a lot of mucus and phlegm and she started choking and started hitting blue and purple or whatever other could breathe then she came wrath that she slept for a bit and he started choking again any was terrible because like I mentioned earlier she's nine months old so she's pretty helpless and we've got to do everything for her obviously it was the nine month old and she'd be put in that situation it's our first child it's scary stuff because we don't know what to do either we've been on basic CPR courses for kids and what to do but when I get to that

(Start: 00:07:27)
point it's a different ballgame so the story is she's back at her she's stable she's fun doing a lot better apparently when you're awake and you're more active you can process the phlegm better than when you sleep think so and we stayed it a little while and she was a care and that discharged us and yeah so in saying that as you might've guessed already I'm not putting the pots to the rx-7 right now and yeah it's mid-morning at the moment we've had like two hours sleep but my wife and our super tired but as you can see we are in the new garage the new house it's a bit of a [ __ ] right now but to work in progress and I want to show you guys around it okay so this is where the GTR is going to be parked

(Start: 00:08:27)
this was actually someone's workshop you can see all the panels that are left here they were all mounts on the walls so the guy in the house he armed electrically sure he was but he ran a little business from here and he was doing I don't know handyman jobs I guess so all the stuff will fit on the walls I'm really tearing it down you can see all the stuff that needs to come out there needs to come out missing ceiling board so I've got runner board that I'm going to be fitting in here closing all this up bringing the last down below the runner board and putting all these big nails with the water and he's really crazy big the size of that completes in my hand and the whole lot of it is him bigger one method yeah so this was a house that we picked up a bit cheaper than our budget and nothing wrong with it it's really really cool house and it's got so much potential but we've had to spend quite a

(Start: 00:09:31)
lot of money to get it to our standards and make better they can see for example I mean we tearing the bathroom to pieces we smashing all the tiles of the wall crank on the floor tiles taking everything I mean look how old-school this was that is where the towel rails a little teepee holder and let's see through brown plastic stuff is super old-school like 70 ship some holder thing terribly on so this an example stuff is old school we ripping it up redoing the floors in the whole house we we doing a lot place already finish the painting so here's a little bit about site that I'll let you did see for this section here of this jackin Park cause on the other side of this wall there is space

(Start: 00:10:32)
to put two cars at and it's covered which is brilliant so it's going to be rx-7 over here modular or maybe or X or X out of Matt and we're going to be cutting back all these trees and all of us in the pocket extend all the way across there so there's more loads of parking space and on the right hand side rather top configure sorry not yet trying to keep a little bit of privacy for now but we've got plans to build a double garage so this plans for expansion plans for building a little granny flat living quarters for people so lots of room for us which is cool and then also on that side there is another carport like double carport type thing not sure if I'm going to keep it just yet but this section here we're gonna cut back we're going to label it out and I have box and cause there so yeah that's a little bit of a sneak peek of the house so once

(Start: 00:11:32)
again guys huge apologies and I must say welcome to all the new subscribers I've had about 40 plus - maybe 40 to 50 new subscribers have joined us between Friday and now so crazy guys welcome the videos on usually this dry and boring but I think I've explained myself ready so we're looking at finishing up here with this house in about a month and a half plus - then I'll be back to normal I'll be doing two maybe three videos a week working on the GTR weekend or exhibit loads of stuff is happening loads of stuff it's to come for the cause I just haven't had time have another energy so did bear with me for a little bit thank you so much for being here with me and I'll see you all next time [Music]

[Music] what's up guys welcome to the vlog hope everyone's well I'm actually little bit sick at the moment so I'm going to be leaving these glasses on because my eyes are red and itchy underneath of it sneezing the whole day eating whole yesterday but I've got an hour now where I'm going to be working on the car I have to come in because tomorrow after inspectors coming in to check out the cause or actually just the black home and try and push them to do the inspection on the silver car now if possible there's a couple small things that I need to do on the black car right now just to make sure that's okay one is I just here throw this battery charger on here it is spooning your sort out this so if she's fixing here I believe a rough spot today so busy sorting that out work in progress

(Start: 00:01:15)
okay cool I'm just gonna do a quick once-over on the black car make sure it's got enough oil in the water make sure it's fine for the inspection and once it's charged up for about half an hour plus - I'm gonna start it up leave it running for another 25 minutes and then remove the silver one inside the black one outside because the guard is coming to do the inspection for the black one only however my truck convincing see the silver twelve seconds later okay now that the black one is all good to go I'm going to clean up this mess the one in the wash the car it's been sitting outside for a while so super Daisy - the car is full of kittens are going to sort that out quickly and I need to close up all these all panels and things and just make sure it's okay [Music]

(Start: 00:02:18)
stock price and I take with me because I'm going to be re spraying I'm going to make these end pieces over here purple and I'm going to make this black so it will match with my whole color scheme that I'm planning on doing I will put these dudes back on they're not finished though so I'm going to come back and tackle this another day okay the sides enough now I need to take apart the ECU bracket and transfer it across the apex of RFC just notice something when I'm taking it off there's no mounting holes on they pick C for the bracket so what I'm going to do is just for the sake of the inspection I'm getting queued double-sided paper to the side yeah it's easy use in the kick panel is in that's what it looks like now nice and close up just going to tidy

(Start: 00:03:19)
up the evilish good idea one thing I forgot to do is bring some velcro to stick this guy up here it'll look pretty cool once it's up okay I'm going to move this car out of the way and I'm going to give it a quick quick wash and then we're going to move this black car out of the way swap the two but before that I brought my big camera with me so I want to take a couple photos for my Instagram if you're not on - the gram join it it's apps Nell Cal JDM now the car is still idling quite high I haven't done my idle procedure yet I know there's an idle procedure for the apex CPR FC I'm yet to dirt I'm going to

(Start: 00:04:19)
probably go tomorrow after the inspector leaves so idling pretty hard mode [Music] [Music] [Music] ding [Music] [Music] goes washes over honey watch the top half because any but one of my washi thingies and I usually use two in two buckets just to the top top and I'll spray down the car look it better like I said I don't much time so that's the best that I can do for now next thing is unplug the battery charger

(Start: 00:05:21)
the stop is caught up make sure everything is fine I'm gonna move it they take one or two photos my Instagram and then just do a quick once-over on this car make sure that's one okay let's get this water started when you push the hold button eat my foot on the brake and we're love here's the two cars together looking pretty sweet first time they actually both Alps together [Music] ok I'm done I just took my first ever photos with my DSLR of cause I don't know if they're going to come out any good but anyway it was a try and I'm looking out blows into Instagram

(Start: 00:06:26)
so I'm going to move one of these cars back into the garage line them up try and get an inspection on both cars tomorrow if not just this one will get inspected but I'm stoked the silver ones back up and running like ones fine pretty confident in the past and you peel the off when I got off and God sorry for the short little video I'm a little bit pressed for time at the moment I am gonna upload few more videos during the week one of which in the silver car where maybe sorting out the idol because it's one rod moment only about 1 5 1 6 I'm going to do that whole a pixie idle procedure so it's gonna be a bit of a boring vlog and someone's phoning me while I'm vlogging Wow so once I'm done with the auto procedure on this car I'm going to be doing some work on the GTR I've got a few little things that I want to start installing I've been neglecting I call a little bit because of impress the time of the house Conway to move things are coming together looking at the end of August September once everything's done and have all the cars together and I can

(Start: 00:07:26)
just do what I want within that space of time that I get cause which is pretty cool I also need to do the maintenance on both the GTR and the rx-7 so I'm going to be doing that soon the GTR propaganda on Thursday along with mudding doing a little bit of personal stuff along with putting a few little bits and bobs into the car because that's about it hope the audio wasn't too bad in this it's a little bit windy outside did thank you so much for being with me and I'll see all the next vlog [Music] - the d-backs [Music] body but enhance if you ain't never heard of me about to show you what the ass

Title: Apexi Power FC Fixed My RX7 FD!!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-k39cB70y4

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] what's up guys and welcome to the Vlog I finally got my apexi power FC got it out of Customs about $150 later and it's somewhere in the abyss of my Workhorse my nisson juke midnight Edition you can see it's full of and paint and silicone and yeah apparently renovating house uh I don't have a van or a truck as you guys may call it so I'm loading everything in that car so today we are going to fit the apexi P SE into this car and hopefully it fixes the problems even though this car cost like a quarter of the price of this one it it's still pretty good looking

(Start: 00:01:00)
however very noticeable when you walk in on this side this door has definitely been resprayed I may have forgotten to mention Ben is on his way he's going to be coming through with his FC hako may not need it cuz we're just going to be plugging in the power FC but if we do and we need to check some stuff on a laptop he's got it with him so here's the Box nothing fancy it is a secondhand unit I Sav myself about 150 there's the hand controller some of you dudes have already seen this on Instagram if you're not on my Instagram then go add me it's nkel JDM and here it is AP pixie powerfc pretty standard stuff it is the fd3 S5 model which is a 1995 to 1998 stand at

(Start: 00:02:01)
plugs so I'm going to leave this R here going to grab some tools from the garage and I'm going to take out the stock ECU so there are some tools in here if you guys haven't seen this is a 1927 or 28 Model A Ford and this is a 1919 Dodge brother it's 100 years old in 2019 that's crazy what's up Ben good how you doing okay dudes Ben has just arrived hey guys you all remember Ben he was here with me last time and we were investigating the check engine light issue that we had on the car Ben built a little resistor pack with the LED and it was doing the whole Blinky thing and we were trying to figure out all the engine HS so we're going to go ahead now and we are going

(Start: 00:03:02)
to take out the standard ECU from the RX7 type RS I think it's just need some Phillips screwdriver things just to pull out the screws and then we're good to go all right guys here's what we looking at looks like there's just these four and there might be some at the back wow yeah this is like what do you see down there looks like 10 okay all right let me get one and I'm like small I'm these T spaces that's what she said dud while B is busy I figured I would show you guys something so there's a little bit of work that's been done on the black RX7 one I had the bush rebuilt over here so my father's actually got equipment at his Workshop to rebuild bushes so this is no longer sagging which means you can open up the Bonnet without scraping on here also replac the windscreen wipers those are back nice and fresh and this one had issues as well with the

(Start: 00:04:02)
bush it was falling in so that's all sorted I don't think I have the keys on me but the little fuel pump plate that was in the back there oh okay car's open oops good thing we don't have crime in South Africa don't if you dudes remember this was completely stuck full of rust so this is all been sorted out now we got hammer out on here this is just temporary this carpet needs to be sorted out and one thing this car is missing that I only just picked up now and notice the difference is that this doesn't have the parcel shelf like the silver RX7 does anyway slowly getting this car sorted out no always I got him M just trying to get the cable connectors out now okay there we go first one's out second

(Start: 00:05:04)
one nice up cool go so this is what the standard ECU looks like on a 1997 type RS now apparently this ECU is different to the other models because this is a 16 bit previously all the other ECS were 8 bit stupid test first which is are the connectors the same because otherwise you Yep looks exactly the same to me yeah 100% guys if you keen on seeing Ben's 2008 St he's got a lot of work on it it's got a TD 62g if I'm not mistaken whole bunch of work on this car it's pretty potent if you guys are ke on seeing it smash that like button let's get it up to 35 likes on this video and let me know in the comments if you ke on seeing this car I'll do my first ever review on a car in Ben's 2008 St Str okay sweet so okay turn the on we should get some action there okay guys the ECU is in I'm about to turn the key for the first time put it in ignition and then we're going to reset this

(Start: 00:06:07)
ECU oh looking good that's a good sign cool yeah so it seems to be reading everything right now we need to go to the ETC menu it'll be an etcetra and then bottom there's a reset all data in this yeah that's the one gra be that guy shut up uh yes I'm guessing next cool okay now it says cycle it by doing that okay now we should be back on stock cool okay well we can go look good because it didn't go to the other screen yeah the map Tracer well we can go have a look here this is just all your sensors so we got your injector obviously most of these will only show when the car is running okay but if we go into um so that's your monitor menu so you can have you can have only one channel if you want like your injector

(Start: 00:07:08)
duty cycle or you can have 2 48 or you can have the map Tracer which gives you it shows you which cell you are in the in the thing but that's that's a mission to tuner that's why you have the FC hacker yeah and then in your setting this is where you can do your ignition map uh your fuel map um your Boost if you this will be doing boost control on here um and then you can go look at oh you can set your your rev here so like your your rev limits uh your idle speeds everything set in there so it's quite High 8,100 yeah so that's that's what it's set at by default um water temp blah blah blah okay now what I heard is on your first start after doing a full initialization it's going to be a bit of a wonky idle probably yeah and it's going to relearn the idle yes apparently I think that's how it does yeah and then the only other thing I know is it's said you here this is I ke for you can go to sensor check okay and that gives us all the voltages from the sensors and all the switches and everything okay so we

(Start: 00:08:08)
can actually would have to go see what what these mean but we can make sure that sensors are reading okay cool yeah all right moment of truth so let's get back into here cuz that's where we want to see yeah and see if it starts okay I'm going to turn it yeah okay the revs went a little bit higher than normal sounds good 1,300 RPM 1,400 just out of Interest I want to see if the car is smoking on the outside nope no smoke nothing at all yeah so the car actually stopped smoking like after my second video of this RX7 a water temps going up now so then when we're in this so you can select which stuff you want to cuz you can only have eight things so if we want to air temp instead of speed we could swap those out

(Start: 00:09:10)
or something like that but I think um or battery voltage yeah I'll play around we compare around the I've actually had one of these in my 99 GT Turbo okay okay but I had no idea how to do any sort of shooting back then cuz I didn't really care yeah yeah someone else's problem exactly yeah oh that's interesting it's picking up a tiny bit of knock might be a faulty KN sensor the revs are definitely a lot higher than what it was before [Applause] yeah everything looks good I'll figured i' put everything back together before we did this so the car is pretty much stuck right now other than the voltage stabilizer and those green pots yeah but I mean that's negligable irrelevant yeah so the car is doing a little bit of hunting at the moment um I believe this is [Applause]

(Start: 00:10:11)
normal so that's all of the auto control I'm just going to let it warm up a little bit longer and I'll do a RI t test we just saw something very strange it was off cam I wasn't recording but the car just switched itself off it started doing that hunting and doing that uh idle up idle down and then all of a sudden the car just switched itself off but it turned itself off when it hit 75° C on the water temperature Ben ready I'm going to rev it okay I know [Music] truth working

(Start: 00:11:12)
D and AO fun as well hard F yeah okay dude so I've just been messing around a little bit off cam the car has been running ever since and and it's still revving no problems there is that knock issue that the powerc is picking up bit of a strange one we're just going to turn down the OD a little bit it's sitting at like 1,600 plus minus the thing is it's actually set to between 1,000 and 1,200 okay guys so the good news is the car is running it's working I've said this already like three or four times in this Vlog I'm sorry about that but it is working again fantastic news we've had the FC haker plugged in and we saw one value the V et1 value which seems to be the wideband throttle position sensor or full range throttle position sensor that's reading low values and or maybe not the right values I'm not sure what it's supposed to be reading without Googling this but the car's working

(Start: 00:12:16)
we're able to rev the idols a little bit high it's sitting at about5 it's supposed to be sitting at about 720 to 800 and with the air conditioning on at 900 however I don't have an air con in the car cuz I pulled the belt off blah blah blah it's working but it's sitting very high and there's some false knock or maybe knock that is coming in and it's showing maximum of about 9 units when you rev the car and the warning is set to 60 so maybe that's just normal and that's how it works in the RX7 but the good news is the car is working I do need to get a wideband on the car so I'll probably buy an innovate lc2 or an mtxl or an A version I need to get actually two of them I need one for the GTR one for this car this poor car doesn't need anything cuz cuz it's lame but the silver RX7 and my GTR will get one of those and I'll probably buy one in the next couple weeks or so but there are some good signs so Ben thankfully brought through his uh FC hacker and he was able to plug everything in and save the logs so I'm

(Start: 00:13:16)
going to have those logs so if you guys know anything about tuning on apexi and want to take a look at the logs just let me know but guys thank you so much for being with me on this journey and Ben thank you so much dude for coming along and helping out Bo also work on i7s cool guys remember smash that like button if you want to see Ben's 2008 St Str it's got quite a lot of work how much power are you seeing on that car Ben about 220 kw 220 kw okay so 220 kw that's about 340 350 horsepower yeah on the wheels yeah okay so it's pretty potent so if you guys want to see that car I'll do my first ever review on a car on his smash that like button let's get it up to 35 likes and I'll do a video Al thank you so much for being with me on this journey and I'll see you all next time perks got the man I got the is what I mean when I say take them to church man I'm back with more bars your girlfriend on my Opportunity Knocks

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] what's up guys welcome to the blog it's been quite a while and a lot of you guys have been asking me where the hell have I been and what is going on with my rx-7 is it working and not working so first of all I'm sorry I've been away for about a week and a half I haven't been able to it from the car actually it's been less than a week if I come to think about it I lost worked on this car on Saturday last week so the give or take about a week so the honest truth is I have enough energy to do any correlate that stuff in the last week I received the keys from a new house it's been awesome however stressful at the same time I've got painters in there there's some driveway guys coming into retar there's security there's also stuff happening and it looks like it's going to take quite a while probably up until September and so we can actually move

(Start: 00:01:00)
into the house but anyway enough about that I will show you these the garage and the cardboard and that's sort of section where we'll be keeping the cars and the plans to extend and make more garages on the property so I can start collecting and keeping cause just like this one but it'll be in another block so quickly before I move on to bigger and greater things which is the GTR that I haven't seen in five weeks I haven't driven the car and started I haven't done anything I'm hoping the damn thing works I'm yet to have that car let me down so it's going to be the moment of truth starting it up the first of all quick update on what's happening it's still broken I'm waiting for their pics I'm waiting for the apex II parks I'm waiting for the apex II power if seat arrived it's in South Africa now that is with teen customs I always have issue of customs don't get stuck there is a delay and then eventually again and after

(Start: 00:02:01)
paying and whatever it's up by so I'm just waiting for the ECU's unit erupts I'm going to vomit on the car I'm pretty much going to do straight away as soon as a collector come here for a dedicated vlog start the car up and hopefully a fixing the issues if it doesn't then compression tests with a rotary compression tester I have not a compression test the piston test the lottery guys have been coming on saying hey why don't you just do piston compression test if you can get hold the rotary one I have done it a salon T five psi on the rear with the three consecutive jumps on the gauge thingy that's what you call it and on the front one it was 105 to 110 plus minus also one two three so I saw six sparks in total anyway so I want to say pixie Garcia but the commander was a good plan FC Hawker that I'm going to be borrowing from I made Ben who you saw in the previous video again the husband blog being is going to come around if this

(Start: 00:03:03)
issue the plugin is if see how going take quick look but hopefully you can just get away without doing that and figure out what is wrong with the car I'm hoping it's just that II see you grounding issue that I mentioned in the last video and they pick C much softer so if it doesn't so what I've got my pixie RFC if it's a rebuild the different story the car needs to be rebuilt because I need to register and Larson to this car however wasn't planning on doing it now and since I'm already hemorrhaging money painting and all that sort of goodness for the new house one is all do rebuild so what's next in the list of what they pick C Perry FC our show GG they've got some purple hoses coming from this car so I showed you I've got some purple houses excuse the mess I kind of lift it like it was to the EC panels open that's really for the epoxy yes some purple hoses I'm going to be doing the colors comparable vacuum then I'll end up

(Start: 00:04:07)
buying some gauges there are swoosh gauges they look very decent age droll that nothing over the top those are going to go in the rx-7 not this one in that our exhibit and the plans for this car nothing yet I'm still busy doing the last one second waiting for the inspector just to come in and prove everything he's been delayed he's going to coming through next week so happy that the source of the Arkansas keying is caught on the road and driving and doing some review videos which is going to be pretty cool I haven't done the review video before so that's it for the rx-7 update the next thing I want to show you do to this down here because teleportation is crazy I guess oh I'm back in the garage worth the blue GTR you haven't seen this in a couple weeks I haven't seen this in five weeks it is dusty s look at that partly because whoever built this garage didn't

(Start: 00:05:09)
put in the plastic things to cover so when arranged like a little rain spots all over the car pretty sure so I haven't bother doing it myself I don't bother fixing it up I'm not going to miss this garage at all I really can't wait to me because I'm going to have so much more space to work on cause so you need to know I've been doing all the work on those car myself and obviously the others the others have got a lot more space because the box somewhere else but they're all going to be coming together and I'm going to have all the cars together when I loose the new house so we have long I'll be showing you guys all the cars at the same time so just to put you a little bit perspective this is the amount of space that I have when I'm working on this car so that should be like that that's how much space I have a month out of the car and the thud there's not that much space either this is what I've been vlogging with in this space for the last year plus minus into started blogging actually I started

(Start: 00:06:11)
vlogging June last year pretty cool tiring I must say it's time but it's pretty good let's get to it I haven't tested I haven't driven I haven't started this car in five whole weeks northern nervous the battery might be gone I don't know I've just been doing all the timid rotary work but what we're going to do is change a little silicon hose couple of things okay so this is called silicon humpers whoo our b-26 a little bit of a dusty or b-26 but it's lower between so except these two works right Campos needs to go here add an issue with this silicon popping off and my

(Start: 00:07:16)
beading wasn't big enough so I made the beading a little bit thicker because of the topless pop-ups that's all sorted now but this was a cut off piece so it looks like so beating sort of this is not going to come off again and Campos needs to go out there I just realized if my main tool box with the rx-7 and I'm not prepared to give fidget so I'm using shift expand it ah thought it I'll end up cutting the bastard and probably never use it plus a little bunch of spare pieces so listen going to rinse to leave trough pumps and t-bolt clamps it'll for sure because I've stretched a semi six silicone on top of this gas these caps don't exactly fit but then the same for the bottom here guys wouldn't believe how hot it is inside the Garant I am sweating so badly because there were these lights blaring plus the more that last did and garage doors closed windows

(Start: 00:08:19)
are closed I can't work on the car here without closing up everything because I'm not allowed making any noise so pretty much the size okay I'm confident this is going to work now I've got some really thick beading on the side definitely going to hold now keyboard clamp here Tibor clamp is there any other starters giving me issues and I should be good to go some boost okay let's take this for draw I'm going to take some tools with me just in case it pops off when I get stranded somewhere now it's super dangerous yeah there's been quite a few incidents recently where people have been breaking down on the freeways and people have been coming and stabbing the guy that's broken down stealing all those belongings and all that stuff so pretty scary stuff hope it doesn't happen I'm not going to go on the free I'm going to stay around the little suburb and make sure the cars okay I've didn't bobbled I'm pretty sure it won't pop off but let's see if the car key starts okay let's give it a start

(Start: 00:09:22)
it's a good sign I can hit a few one guy okay let's do are you there we go okay royal pressure looks good let's go

(Start: 00:12:00)
I could get some back at my place I've got a whisper now because the garage doors open and I don't wanna wake anybody up any more than I already have bringing the car back home something wasn't quite right with the car it was beasting 0.7 bar and then put a little bit controller and I managed to get to go back up to 1.1 which is what I had to sit on and I managed to get two little least attempts which win okay and then kind of hit like a flat spot again and was boosting 0.7 bar again don't know what the story was that set the boost back I've got two settings and B volume a is 0.7 bar and E is 1.1 bar and I was definitely running on B and I even changed a to 1 bar and didn't do the trick anyway doubtful that you guys heard this but just before I into the little driving video the car lid off a huge

(Start: 00:13:02)
backfire and there was a flame that came out I saw the reflection on the car that I just passed and it looked pretty epic and there was a car behind me as well so he must have thought what the hell is going on others fireball anyway that's it for now I'm going to carry on next week I'm going to get that taxi power FC for the rx-7 next week I'm going to put that it's going to be the next video the day after I'm going to be doing a oil change on this car and the silver rx even with them ok notice well this is what's currently in the car right now this is casual age tend only 60 here's one of them it's the GTX ultra clean 1040 because the white is supposed to be better for arbitrary six using a 1040 and then I'm using a twenty fifty on the rx-7 because I'm going to get back inside before you get sheltered by the neighbors thank you so much for being with me and I'll see you all in the next look

Title: Working on the Mazda RX7 Type RS.. Again!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM-K9N1LudA

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] what's up guys welcome to the vlog it's early morning the sun's Bailey out that's what it looks like outside at the moment I'm gonna be working on the rx-7 for a good five six hours I've been doing these little one hour stands during the day during working hours it hasn't been working for me so I'm back here with rx-7 on the weekend and I'm gonna be doing a whole bunch of it so the plans for today is to try and get everything out of here and out of the way because I'm gonna be checking all the vacuum hoses like I mentioned the last video I found a broken vacuum down here however that wasn't causing the issue at the car cuz I replaced the vacuum from this car was actually this pop over here there's this little vacuum box this pop was broken and half down

(Start: 00:01:00)
here this one's actually surprisingly good it's still soft however this car it was hot as a rock now I've been running around I find multiple company everyone's out of stock of formal inside diameter vacuum hose and six Mullins ah damnit a vacuum hose sir I found some cut-offs that I had in the garage from my Subaru which I had blue my green in there and read from our GTR like a little bit of black as well so I still have no idea what could be causing the issue it could still be electrical like I said I can't do the compression test just yet I'm reeling out a pic seals for now I've got to try because it was an inspector coming he's actually coming through on Monday and I was hoping we could get this car running but he's just gonna be inspecting the black one for now and I need to get the saw one inspected soon it's a lot of people have issues with grounding and what I've done is I've bought a pivot Rison voltage stabilizer just go I'll open it up later when we

(Start: 00:02:02)
install it but it's got a positive and a negative this will connect to the battery and then the negative a little block and most pool crowds I'll be following this Damien dealer wet personal ground setup I printed it out I'm gonna follow that but using this kit this is the legit kit I know there's a lot of fakes out and I found a website well actually they website to tell if it's fake or not it's actually the legit one which is pretty cool oh yeah and some of my purple pops are up so these are the radiator hoses I'm not gonna fit them now I need to get the cot for any first also I really don't care about putting green and red in whatever color hoses because I'm going to be doing the dress up in purple I'm gonna be putting these photos and listen tech system on this car and the standard ship is a  on to here but of the purple

(Start: 00:03:03)
filters coming and we're purple couplers coming and a purple vacuum hose I'm doing like that hold be luck feel on the car so the plans for now is I'm just going to strip everything start setting up these grounds cleaning the grounds getting the grounds in and then I might be looking for vacuum leaks and replacing what I can with what I have you you

(Start: 00:04:15)
you as a good so engrossed in this whole thing I forgot to check if my camera is actually recording I've replaced the two dodgy vacuums that over here I'll put temporary green cable I've set up this pivot raisin thing and that's working but the car still giving the same blip it issues so I don't think it's a grounding issue however I have run out of cable I've only managed to do this raising the stabilizer thing to the strut to that section over there and then to the URM so I'm going to go to the hardware store now with some spare cable at light blue one I'm gonna temporarily do this set up a new point

(Start: 00:05:17)
over there and then bring another one all the way through underneath here so far not looking good the cost will be in the same thing [Music] Gazza I've gotta apologize I cut the vlog short I stopped filming because I was wasting too much time trying at camera angles and not focusing on the work those day so I stopped filming altogether and I forgot to do a ending for the vlog yesterday so it's now Monday morning the car is running but it's not working properly it still got at the same issues the same ship with the misfiring and backfiring whatever you want to call it however I'm pretty certain that I know what the causes so let's quickly go through a

(Start: 00:06:18)
couple things and what steps I've decided to take to possibly fix this car before you begin here's the black one the King Nelson 6e needs a little bit of a cleanup there's some paint issues over there there's some rust that was getting fixed up over on the bonnet otherwise it's looking good getting this slowly this one works here's the silver one looking nice at 60 down there [Music] well the reason why I moved it out of the way is because I had an inspector that was supposed to be coming for the black car but let them land up happening now he's coming through another date okay so let's talk a little bit about what I'm gonna be doing and what my findings have been Horace will Thea let's move it across to the front first

(Start: 00:07:21)
[Music] wrong key again [Music] [Music] [Music] okay let's prickly talk about what I found and what I did yesterday on this car so the one thing I thought is I install this pivot raisin thing it's not how to proceed the way I want it I do want to

(Start: 00:08:22)
run the cables but need to get things sorted out and I'll see that - I've got to make sure grounds it around some on the need that came out of cut I'll point you all the vacuum hoses that I could find I left some isalus stuff off I just found the EC that were cracked one of them that was broken here brittle they already breaking it and that's how bad it was before so just put some temporary green one on I'm gonna be putting purple on there then the next thing is the e-book so obviously I'll pull it out and I'll miss your humble assembly something I found was this saw this talk was supposed to connect over there and let's just place it downwards and that's just the bench atmosphere now to this here is the Blofeld in the charge release develop now the car runs significantly better without those two I will see when you're accelerating a lot

(Start: 00:09:24)
of air comes out of here so the car is now boosting better with those two pops out it's still missing there but there's definitely a few cups and it's taking longer than the rev range to get to positive pressure I had a boost gauge connect to the car was able to rave the core durable testing and essentially I was able to get higher up in the rev range without their stupid must fire down to me is definitely a fuel cut and I'm pretty sure it's electronically control is coming from the ECU so goes now after reading tons and tons and tons of stuff about this car I've come to the conclusion that the issue that I have is related to the ECU itself in the grounding and the way it works specifically with these mites as and the amounts of resistance that there is I'm not gonna go too deep into it because I don't know effects or pan without googling it but you guys gonna do a quick google if you just happen if you just do a quick Google search and top an rx-7 if the hesitation and top an ECU at

(Start: 00:10:25)
the end you'll find quite a few threads in the rx-7 club and other forums and you will see countless information on the exact same issues that I'm experiencing the stock swap them out put in the hell tech put an advocate Romek on a pixie RFC and it fixes the problems some people have seen some decent results but not great when they're done grounding now I've actually seen the car perform a little bit better now with some grounding issues the misfire is not as heavy as it was before not as prominent it's still there but it's not great now it could still be an apex seal that's chipped I don't know as US and about a week and a half plus - I'm gonna get this car done with your vision test with the rotary compression tool right now I have two subtypes nothing I can do but what I've done is I've now bought and a pixie power FC with the hand controller will still be buying AFC DataLoggers which means I'm gonna be able to tune this car

(Start: 00:11:27)
I'm gonna be able to borrow parts what's called an exhaust intake well I was gonna do that anyway but running for stock you see but now I can actually tune the cost was sympathy for those Artem's and get some decent gains now I don't know where I'm going with this car of the sport house funds are bit low but who knows I might go single-tier or maybe a whole set 50 here's a chi 50 wall on our right now is that I'm going to be getting an ECU and I hope it's going to fix the problems because I don't think it's mechanical but I think it's anything else wrong with the car the car has been perfect up until it came to syafiqah apparently was running from Japan of the full service history up until nine and a half thousand kilometers ago I literally have every single maintenance sheets from the cars brand-new from from the beginning and the cause and pretty damn good condition I've got a feeling the buyer just didn't want to spend money did not fix it and you just plug the car so let's hope for the best hope it's not a

(Start: 00:12:28)
big sales and I'm hoping this a taxi power of season sort of the issues if not Tomatoes coming out I'm gonna rebuild this motor I'll probably do a street 40 and then go from there but plans for this car don't know just yet I'm gonna do the intakes the HKS super power permanent be putting on the HKS exhaust but only after I get this car fixed and running properly again so it goes just a little bit of lots at the end of the tunnel that's the update on this car I'm gonna be stopping these already seven videos from now until they fix the parasya Rob's it's currently in the UK on either goes to Shepherd the probably DHL on the shipping I think maybe three four days called another flip video on that so I'm gonna stop the videos on or exhibit from now the next is going to be the r32 GTR is some outstanding work that I need done on the car the one thing I'm dying to do on that car is do the maintenance on either serious and will change from the far radiator fluid changing all the filters all of that sort of stuff break phlearn etc I need to do that spin some Tamara then I've got a few little goodies that I need to just sort out on the car change my caliper kind of really small

(Start: 00:13:29)
stuff exhaust heat trap etc then on the other news is Saturday we just received keys for our new house I'm gonna be flat-out pursue that so you guys have been saying three four five videos a week recently because of this car but that's all gonna go down maybe one video a week for the time being until I can get settled in renovations finished at the new house and get all nice and moved in there the good thing is the garage is much much bigger than where the GTR is currently which is freaking awesome plus I have a space for cause that's why we bought a house and missing space for family anyway guys thank you so much for being with me on this journey lots at the end of the tunnel we will get this car running again gals thank you so much and I'll see you next time [Music]

Title: Diagnosing Misfire - Type RS RX7 FD3S
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YG9Et4ETiI

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] hey guys and welcome to the vlog what I'm about to show you now it has actually been filmed three days after the vlog which I'm about to play in the next two minutes so I'm going to give you a quick update of what I've done and my frustration so far so the vlog that I'm about to show you is myself and my mate bin we busy doing some testing with the cell lot and trying to figure out what error codes so this is the condition of the car right now I'm busy pulling an intersection apart of pulled off into cooler parts the car still giving me the same symptoms I have found a problem though with the vacuum leads so I pulled that section off strut bars and come off now I'm going to pull off this whole assembly there's an issue where the part that goes from down there

(Start: 00:01:03)
somewhere I can see it over there hopefully but this piece broke off and it's supposed to be sitting on a filter which was trying to make a temporary thing here but I'm just going to go buy a new one it broke as well so the base key the pop inside have the filter and this was getting a little vacuum box type thing that was broken I put some temporary popping in I used the filter from the black Oryx even started a car obsession the aircraft that is throwing is the idle air control solenoid which is at the back here now I've actually pulled it out of cleaned up these Coquina dried it out put it back in the car I'm still getting the same error when of you the diagnostic and you'll see in the video it shine error code 34 aircraft 34 is the Ardell control solenoid when I pull the plug for the auto control solenoid I get error 23 now air 23 is supposed to be a fuel thermal sensor strange but I can replicate the

(Start: 00:02:05)
same issue on the soil so if a portable plug which sits just underneath this guy it gives me air 23 anyway so what I did is I pulled the idle control solenoid from this car move it across the silver one and the cars giving me the same sometimes doing the same so I put everything back together make sure the black on starts and now I'm back to messing around with vacuums and all of that so I'm glad I found a problem with one wrecking lead I've temporarily fixed that I try to start at slab design problems misfiring spluttering etc a lot of y'all saying just do a compression test well I can't do one right now there's one company within 500 kilometers of me that has a rotary compression tester you won't lend it out I need to get the car out to him the only way I can get the car out to him is to obviously turret or get on the road I can't either legally until I get some

(Start: 00:03:05)
inspection done on the cop in layman's terms to basically say that the car has been legally imported from there I can start applying for 3 day 21 day permits etc so I cannot get this compression test done unless Obama and Tesla which will come from overseas it's still going to take two weeks so I'm around with the car I'm trying to fix what I'm trying to fix so it could well be APEC cos I still don't know yet I will find out in about two weeks when I get the car to the shop so they can do the compression test in the meantime I'm trying to figure out what's broken I'm stripping whatever I find that's broken I'm either swapping or I'm replacing and that's all I can do for the next two weeks so 99% of you guys have been really supportive and helpful commenting giving me ideas damage trust certain things which is cool thank you so much dude there's been a select few people that are in popping out and saying just get a compression test and stop horsing around stop messin I can't I've got to do something would you guys rather me not film this at all and just maybe put out a vlog a week or maybe a

(Start: 00:04:06)
little bit less maybe a vlog every two weeks until I fix this damn car or should I carry on in this journey until he goes was trying to fix this car with what I have okay guys that's it for me I'm going to carry on at the vlog the vlog is from three days ago where we were just figuring out what engine error codes there are so I hope you guys enjoy I'll see you in the next video so this is a continuation from the previous vlog where I ended up pulling off that drive belt that was connecting me power steering and the aircon pulley the belt that sitting right over there I was hoping that was providing false knock to the ECU and causing the fuel kettles bak kut and well that wasn't a damn case so I've got a list of things that I do want to try and it's a long list so obviously like test coil packs check vacuum lead long long long lists are posted in the last video so one thing that I haven't done is actually check the engine codes to see if there's any broken sensors or anything's wrong with the car but it turns out that the JDM models don't have a check engine light in them so you've got to build a

(Start: 00:05:08)
little resistor pack with an LED on it and connect it into this little diagnostic box in the engine bay let me show you this this full diagnostic box so it's got all these little pins here and you just basically take a paperclip and you jam it into these little plug things yet and then you put an LEDs somewhere there now I've got it written down somewhere I must check that out now that will allow us to pick up the engine codes now I've got my buddy Ben coming across he is an electrical engineer he's put together all 680 ohm resistor I think that's one of those with a little LED he's gonna bring that across we're gonna plug that in now we're going to test them hopefully the sensors are throwing some readable codes that will tell us what's wrong with this damn car dudes Ben has just arrived we are going to be starting we're going to be doing this Diagnostics on the car and this was my buddy Ben again the hospital mode we

(Start: 00:06:08)
are going to be doing this diagnostic thing like I explained the JDM models did not have a check engine light so Ben has been kind enough to help me out and he's got an LED where we gotta it little LED would like a conferring honors so resistor okay quick to make sure to take in jannat perfectly we're gonna plug that in now and hopefully this call will give us a check engine light fault and we can determine what's wrong with the car I guess it'll be thin and ground all right let's bum-rush one here okay we can you zoom down okay well yeah I mean that's you way okay I'm going to put the corn ignition I'm not starting yeah can you watch the but you suddenly can if you just put this one actually if there's something that once it's plugged in that it blinks even though there's no

(Start: 00:07:11)
codes it'll tip the cell will turn on for 30 seconds and go off if they are slow code that will start flashing the throw that infertile where if it stays on awesome the jump while kept that's not making good kitchen okay so we if it's just till it's retaken then we actually what I'm happy because it doesn't look anything right dudes I'm going to put the car in ignition now and hopefully this is going to show us a little LED flashy thing and three short fractions will take us to this seam if that's hard to codes and okay the codes can escape tens digits and once there's a tens digit is one point two seconds long or ones with more point four so once is the short tens of the long okay so there's a start and you get one flash to long flashes three long flashes then pause one one two three four five or four you

(Start: 00:08:11)
see just the father angle goes into the red dot yeah yeah so I think it's force it's 34 that's the break one two three little bit shop right and one two three four I'm sure solve it God forgive it ten and four or hot 34 there ten and a ball no Tim again there's no for either but I reckon it's gonna be bigger than it on purpose Mary so we managed to find out that it's throwing error codes and you guys try and decrypt it and see if maybe we wrong but it seems like it's throwing error code 34 which on the list is idle air control valve now that's what's behind the throttle body so that's a good place to start and it could be causing all these issues so been an are going to take a look right now because it's saying yeah that's open or short that's that's literally what that error code says then finally valve is open circuit or short circuit and so if we could check on on

(Start: 00:09:15)
it if it is open or short then that would help a lot it's no hands is going to be very useful yeah I'm gonna work for me friendly girls are seeing 0.8 times that sounds about right for actually both I'm not real good that I can gather in the ASD so we with the black for now and we've decided that we're going to plug this guy in here and pick up codes with this car now funny enough this car has also got issues we don't know what it is quite yet because it's varying a 35 for what it seems like and there's no 35 on this piece of paper so you need to have a look at this and tell me what you think now to me that looks like a 35 now I'll put this up on this next video in the comments yes take a look what we are thinking is there this sheet and this information I've got this is from a 1994

(Start: 00:10:16)
USDM version I've obviously got a JDM version is no chick engine left in the car and I don't know how to decode this and maybe just maybe there's a 35 in there or maybe there's a 37 316 we don't know what they actually stand for so maybe our idle air control valve is not the problem so the next thing that Dan and I are going to do is we're going to pull out the connector for the idle air control and we must see if it throws the same error the same number on this car I'm just going to call a commission hot this year for 35 okay so I'm playing techniques against a 33 so maybe that it would be utterly control will just take football part through core purpose for a bypass okay what's that song like valve is a protocol so maybe throttle position

(Start: 00:11:16)
sensor with a 15 interesting okay so maybe that isn't what we looking for so it must be something else going okay so that's definite online I'm going to kill this course for the best hands going up [Music] so in theory now if we pull that out that much to get an 80 number 18 which is throttle position sensor narrower range and it's reset one two one to right okay so we had a tomorrow long on on a and then I think we get the theory now people say where did you see a 12 -

(Start: 00:12:16)
yeah the business or 12 which is throttle position sensor full range and then you saw an 18 yeah 12 an e so that the throttle position seems to narrower range yeah and then you saw the 34 again which is auto air control yeah okay so that that mean had a bit me again so I'm playing technique that gives us there more than 80 those for the TPS break in yeah McKillip out the core okay go so we haven't been able to figure out what the problem is but we are getting closer and it seems like the idle air control valve is definitely the problem it's throwing a number 34 code we've tested this by pulling up different sensors and it is corresponding with the codes on the piece of paper that I have from a 1994 workshop manual for USDM car we are sure it's the auto active control system any problems I need to go back to work and I need to Google this we need to figure out what it is and then we're going to tackle this again more than likely you're going to have to pull out the uim maybe it's a vacuum that's that's perished maybe it's cement block maybe

(Start: 00:13:19)
the solenoids are working or wires pulled either way there's a sensor fault and this sensor could be causing all the issues on the vehicle because thanks so much for being our thank you for support and we'll see in the next look Oh [Music] to the d-backs worth of a platonic or funny but enhance if you ain't never heard of me about to show you what the  is

Title: So my RX7 Type RS is still broken...
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfi6wcE4_FM

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] what's up guys and welcome to another vlog so most of you might know from the previous videos comment sections that this car is now so in the last video I had issues with the idle and all set issues with some sort of like a misfire I managed to sort up the spark plugs I got this changed after not also change the fuse and that fixes the air pump issue in the Hartl resolved itself and also fixed the intercooler part that was broken and cracked so put some temporary piece of silicone and some highs clamps on that sorted out the issues in the car wasn't misfiring or backfiring anymore I came back on Friday or Saturday I don't remember and I'll just miss here on the car started up and it's doing that stupid misfire again now I've looked and

(Start: 00:01:00)
I know there's a common thread on instead for this 3k RPMs fire that happens at these FDS that's not the case mine is anywhere in the rev range if I go wide open throttle I can accelerate 20 30 % through the rev range all the way up and it's fun the minute I put my foot all the way flat any rpm it hesitates it sounds like a machine so I could brought in the lunchbox it'll be in effect it sounds like a machine gun Tommy my god so if you do sigani ideas I know a lot of you guys have been throwing suggestions in the comment section so I really appreciate that and there's a noisy dog in the corner here sorry I've got a little bit of time some quickly just going to pull up fuel pump I want to have a look at that to me it sounds like fuel starvation could still possibly be a sensor or vacuum but one thing for you needs to remember it fixes

(Start: 00:02:03)
itself if the car idles for about 30 or 40 minutes so a long time or if the car gets warmed up after about 50 minutes left around for about 10 and then start up again and the problems gone so I don't think it's a vacuum leak or boost leak anyway it could be fuel or a bad fuel in the car I'm going to look at the fuel pump and try get that out right now [Music] just realized something really important I should probably take the battery terminal or from Ana quickly pop off the negative on the battery and I'm back [Music] okay the covers off this is what it looks like underneath the lots and lots of lots of dead this little terminal here that looks

(Start: 00:03:04)
like it when I pulled it off lots of dust came out maybe it needs a little bit of a clean-up on there anyway so I'm going to pull out this whole assembly now the fuel pump is up I was expecting this whole filter bag to be a lot worse but it's actually pretty down here right here's what it looks like [Music] actually doesn't look too bad on there [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:04:07)
[Music] because I decided to put the assembly back together so things were going back in the reason for doing so is I had a look at the fuel pump in the black or except and then that's looking waste for where it's all rusty and so I don't take a chance I'm going to order a warbird two five five I can get them locally which is cool I have to wait for shipping and all that stuff so I'm going to place an order I'll get one the next one or two days and then I'll come back and swap the fuel pump what I'm going to do now is just quickly finish up and assembly put it back together and then I'm going to go get some more fuel thread in the car because it is pretty damn low at the moment sharing reserve and then we are try other things did I'm back and it's the following day I've had some time to think about and I've had some time to Google and research and I've got someone from Sweden from Jason he's busy helping me out he's an avid rx-7 I know he's got a mad single tear setup I'm sort of thinking about this little bit logically and Hemi up before I start to work the car has got a very loud scratching noise which is coming

(Start: 00:05:09)
from the aircon police bearing now when the car warms up the problem goes away and so does that noise the noise quietens down quite a bit so what I'm thinking is the ECU is doing some or limp mode setup because it's picking up false knock it's a hunch but and to me there's some logic behind it because the noise goes away when it gets hot the problem goes away wins gets playing it's hot when does the noise there's a problem it's the noise difficult from the AC I'm going to be pulling the belt off which is connected to the drought belt the power steering pulley and the aircon pulley now I've never done this before all of you guys know that I'm prettiest when it comes to cars I googled my where I youtube my way out of everything I'm learning I've only just started working on cause I used to pay people to do this for me but now since the photo channel I'm checking this mind I came here last night I didn't vlog I don't do anything I'll try to get that attentional off other than

(Start: 00:06:10)
ever our tools I'm doing thing over there are tools with me now but I'm gonna give it a bath [Music] [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:07:18)
guys let me explain to you what I've done I've pulled off the belt that was connected to the drop section so the draught pulley and then there was an outlet over here and this is a power steering pulley and that is the air conditioner police now that's got a problem with the bearing let's make a noise I'm thinking it's giving false knock that's all off now everything is nice and safe or removed all the tools and I'm gonna be starting the car up if this doesn't fix the problems I don't know what will there we go moment of truth so the scratching noise is definitely going to wear now the only thing to do is wait about

(Start: 00:08:20)
15 minutes and so I've got the right temperature then I can start doing a little bit of risk it it's been about five minutes into the test now and I've noticed something that I haven't seen in a little while there's tiny little cups of what like really really small anything else I see them okay it's gone away now so it made about five six tiny little pups I don't know if it's because it's cold out it's about 12 degrees Celsius at the moment look pretty cold [Music] maybe system condensation you see the cause which is sitting or not while we're waiting Minister clicks this little fan moment

(Start: 00:09:29)
[Music] so I'm gonna settle us to the off position first and we beckon business oh damn that smells of cigarettes because not showing any heat just good [Music] our reserve which is good I put in level 10 liter then I need to get this car out to a petrol station but I don't have a permit so I'm just blogging around with containers I'm going to give it another ten minutes to heat up get the optimum temperature then I'm gonna do a rape test okay guys

(Start: 00:10:31)
we are warmed I'm going to give it a test Oh No please work I was so confident that I was going to sort out the issue these the noise has gone from the front now I don't have an AC what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a small pulley to replace that so I can elite guitar stirring going again I might still be on the right track I don't know maybe the car flooded itself now maybe the spark plugs are gone again I don't know I'm gonna try a couple of the things and then go edit and upload this video if you've got any other ideas I have a new fuel pump on the way that's going to come in I'm going to replace the pump I've got a fuel filter that I've ordered it's going to take a little while there but some willing start swapping and testing parts from either

(Start: 00:11:32)
car just for interest like I've swapped the map sensor across from the black car it's still doing the same thing go thanks love's and I'll see you all in next video [Music] to the d-backs with a little tips you ain't never heard of me about to show you what the is the missing

Title: Did changing plugs fix my RX7 FD3S?
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbcedvqdJ8

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] hey guys welcome to the vlog I'm back with the rx-7 I got you a little bit later than I hoped to so it is pretty dark outside I'm a travel vlog as best as I can so the first thing I'm going to be doing is actually starting with this compression test I'm hoping I'm going to be able to actually get some laughs over there and do some filming if not or just talking us through it but I'm going to take a camera down and we can start pull out the plugs and there's an EGR few that I need to pull out and then obviously uh Nissan would come here and just crank a car for me so my dad's going to do that and I'm going to be tasting the compression so this is the moment of truth let's see how it goes and before I start I picked up some space pieces and I've got how to perform a rotary engine compression test just in

(Start: 00:01:02)
case I forget the steps I have some a setup and I'm gonna be working any [Music] [Music] we spent the last 25 minutes getting the stupid undercarriage God off because it had these stupid screws and the ones on that end that in there and it was one more they were stripped on the head so the yank and pull and strip and obviously the cause of that high off the ground the rest of them used these bolts and washers because there's a little bit difficult for me to film underneath the car so I'm just a fella goes what's going on okay dudes I managed to get the plugs out what a hip job so it's sitting

(Start: 00:02:04)
all the way underneath there I don't know there are tools we have to cut little bars and put extensions on so we made a plan I managed to get the two plugs at the bottom there are two old plugs these are the BER 7eq Peas these are leading plants on the side pulled out the CCSS furnace compression test using a piston engine tester as long everyday battery strength is fun trivia life bugs have done and then I'll remove this BGR fuse from the fuse box which is over there have a friend floor the accelerator pedal okay in throttle more effort in such a tester I guess I'm going to start doing this now myself the camera somewhere and hopefully you get some footage

(Start: 00:03:07)
so he's pressing the home okay neutral yeah again this quick Heal screen one more top it goes underneath the car this is what I'm working with limited space like an inner one hand and head of Tom there's the one bottom plug whole thing and is the new plug that's busy going in at the moment and then there's two new ones at the top sorry the two old ones at the topic so I'm busy fitting this one now I'm going to do that one next when I put those to the compression test was a bit weird I had a shooting out of this one here a

(Start: 00:04:11)
lot of air coming up three successions bang bang bang bang this one not as much air but still pretty damn strong I don't know what that means but I'm putting new plugs in come up with this camera way because of living space yeah okay guys that was Joe how many special needs the car nylon probably should a wait'll we can come in here in Austin in and done something but anyway I'm here plugs are ask new ones and quill needs a back end and here's our old plugs [Music] either non so these are at the top and these are the bottom trailing leading and our corner to tell what's good what's bad yeah obviously you guys would probably know if you read through specialists etc but when I start firing up a corner so how thumbs cross fingers face thumbs do a because need to do mister before we

(Start: 00:06:15)
reading on a forum and a friend of money sent me a message they said it's the aircon bearing for the police coming here not yet so this definitely coming from the belt stop but the cross-border stuff up because the huddle is much much better the core is running smoothly but there's a lot of what smoke [Music] and it smells there's not a stinky smell but it smells but I don't know what it smells like going smell good but if the love again I'm just going to give it another maybe six seven minutes did a warm-up lofty and then I'm a little bit of a rev see

(Start: 00:07:16)
how it fares because previously I was cutting out at about 3000 rpm in about two minutes now and the Watts mark is pretty much gone they're just little pups I'm going to give it another three minutes maybe four minutes little warm-up and then school pretty cold give it a few more minutes then I'll start a little bit of a rape test while I'm waiting for this car to heat up all of the white smoke is now gone it's not there's no Matta Marketo and bids I'm spaced out there it was just a freaking spot like - their number was like and I've just noticed something on this car let's dip into the black one got

these little focus on the front the black one then wash it really changing the bulb on this one as well also busy stripping that fixing of a windscreen plate cause at a decent temperature it's been about 1213 minutes now I'm going to do a bit of a raven all you guys remember it used to cut out at about two and a half three thousand it was splutter and done it's good enough Oh

(Start: 00:09:19)
just doing a once-over on the corner underfunding this here this is all shredded just like the black one the black one had to publish it together temporarily until I get something made up it turns out this one is all stuffed as well so lucky a little piece here I'm going to rip this off and I'll put that on and make some Bush like I've done on the black one so you guys I'm not doing this on cam because I'm going to file me after being underneath the car but I just put this little thing together like this not the best but it's going to hold up for now until I get some aluminium piece made up today so it looks so much like the one on the Black Hawk I have a question for you guys if anyone knows this is where the whopper was and it's sagging at the moment you're trying to sort that out does anyone know how to remove this entire assembly because we want to replace the Bush that's worn any ones with any ideas I haven't googled ear to heaven looks on forums but if anyone knows let me know okay I haven't

(Start: 00:06:15)
arrived with the rx-7 or both rx Evans and I am going to check this caught up and I'm gonna put on jack stand right now so once again I'm skipping forwards and Tom it's the following day two days there's they I'm here just you put a little bit of extra fuel in the car I'm going to check my jack stand that I've set up load not the one part I set up a

(Start: 00:07:17)
little bit higher I've just started I need to set up this one at the same level and just make sure everything secure and I'm going to be coming back to not I decided to do some stuff off camera and one of the things I was looking for is obviously vacuum leave those then once I won them quickly before go and just running through the differences between the black and I went through some teasers and one of them is the 15 amp fuse pretty broken now that was on these that was on the air-conditioner side now that's actually resolved the effort the air pump is now functioning again to the air from saying the motor is

(Start: 00:08:19)
still doing it all rough idle thing and backfiring but at least we somewhere now the FM is now working the girls can have that metallic noise it sounds like it's coming from this area from the belt at least we're getting somewhere the air

(Start: 00:09:20)
pump is now working again I don't have time to carry on now so I'm actually gonna go back to the office I'm going to edit this video when I can and I'm going to upload and tonight I'm going to be doing a compression test I'm going to be doing what they call a champagne test and if the compression is fine I'm going to be changing the spark plugs putting the new ones then if it's not that obviously means a rebuild and the apex shields are gone I'm hoping that's not the case obviously if the seals are fine then I'm going to have to look at other things so it could be sensors some maybe map sensors TPS etc and I'll run through it and swap from the black car to the silver car see what works what doesn't the good news is the air pump is working something obviously blew the fuse I'll have that sorted out in a trace what it was there's probably a faulty air conditioner in the car I don't know I'll figure it out but that's the least of my worries it's running now with the skis guys I'm going to end the vlog here because I'm not going to be able to edit and upload for the next two days or so but feel free to ask me in the questions tomorrow so I'm posting this video today which is Thursday tomorrow will be Friday ask me tomorrow and I should have

Title: My RX7 Type RS is dying...  Help!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbYgnRPadK8

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey dudes welcome to the Vlog I'm hoping you guys can hear me okay cuz I'm actually filming off my GoPro today I don't have my camera with me because I'm paying an unexpected visit to the Mazda RX7 I need to be honest with you guys I came through here this morning I was just popping in and I figured let me just throw some fuel into the car and I dropped in 10 L of 95 octane fuel and I checked the oil levels the oil levels were full and the coolant levels were full so I thought you know what I drove it from down the road up the driveway and everything was okay however it was making a few popping sounds when I was driving and I didn't accelerate hard at all when I started it today it started making popping sounds shaking as if there was like some sort of an earthquake happening and there white smoke bellowing out I'm pretty much  myself because I think it could be Apex seals that have gone but I was doing some reading on the Forum and it could be a couple things so if any of you guys are RX7 owners rotary owners perhaps you could give me some advice

(Start: 00:01:00)
cuz I'm obviously new to this whole thing I'm not a mechanic by trade I've been learning everything off Google so I'm kind of on my own with us I suspect this Apex seals however I've been reading and people are saying check your vacuum leads check your vacuum lead heading into your map sensor could be coil packs could be spark plugs I had a look at the video of the car running in Japan and the idol seem to be perfect the guy did a REV in the car and it seemed to be perfect this is uh engine number uh actually no oil spot no [Music] [Applause] leaks maybe it's just bad quality fuel the car was standing in the Durban port for a while empty on fuel I don't know I'm going to start it up you guys have a look have a listen let me know what you think

(Start: 00:02:19)
think he guys you can see the door is shaking quite heavily the seat is shaking heavily and obviously the engine bay now once it starts to warm up it does Addle a little bit better than what you're currently seeing but there is white smoke Bing out the back now to me I'm pretty sure this is Apex Sals but I'm trying a couple things just to see if it's maybe something else I don't have too much time I'm actually doing this on my lunch break I've got go back to the office but I'm myself because obviously I'm moving house and there's a whole lot of expenses and now I've got this problem let me show you guys what it does when you try and rev it a bit when you rev it it almost pretty much cuts [Music]

(Start: 00:03:27)
out there we go it cut out I don't know what the story is there one thing to take note of is this is that air pump the air pump isn't spinning as fast as it does on the black car on the black car while it's adding it spins pretty damn fast that one's not spinning at all now it's dead again now it takes a little while and you can start up again and things seem to be okay the car's last service was at 93,000 done by Mazda I've got full service history on this car and it doesn't show any issues there were faulty spark plugs at I think 10,000 km but other than that everything was fine the car sitting on 10200 right now and the last service was at

(Start: 00:04:27)
93461 okay while I'm here on I've still got a little bit of time to kill I'm going to pull off the vacuum see if there's any issues on there I also want to compare the speed of this air pump to the black car so I'm going to quickly start up the black car as well first let's take this Cary off I don't if my camera stands here so I'm just going to kind of throw the GoPro somewhere and hope for the best I probably should have come a little bit more prepared I don't have the right tools here so I need to get the strut brace out first because there's a little bolt underneath here and these are the only tools that I carry with me in my work car so this is a bit of a I will have to come back and give us another shot another time I'm just going to throw the bolt back on and then I'm going to start the

(Start: 00:05:28)
air pump on the black car do a comparison video between the two okay let's start this one up and let's go a look at the air pump do a [Music] comparison a it okay it's not starting up let's just start up the black one before I do any more damage okay here's the black FD be pretty sad to see if there actually is a problem with the silver one because the car's in such good condition on the exterior and on the interior especially the interior either way I need to have it fixed I'll get it sorted out okay there's the air pump on the black one I'm going to start this car up let's see what it [Music]

(Start: 00:06:28)
does [Music] see what I mean air pump is running nasty okay guys I'm going to close up shop here cuz I don't have the right tools like I said I was just on my lunch break decided to come across and get a little bit more miserable with the engine not starting on that car dudes if you've got any suggestions I'm not a mechanic by trade I've been learning everything through Google through forums through YouTube if any of you guys are rotary Specialists or know a thing or two please hit me up in the comments section let me know what you think could be the problem how I could resolve what I could look out for worst case is obviously Apex seals but maybe just maybe there's something else that's wrong with the car especially with this whole air pump not spinning like the black one does I don't know guys thank you so much and I'll see you on Thursday nothing's going to change those other two videos I'm still going to make on

(Start: 00:07:29)
Thursday I'm going to be doing a service on the silver RX7 service on my blue GTR and I will see you guys in the next video thanks [Music] dude I got the what I when I take to church man back bars girlfriend on my Opportunity Knocks well some please tell me where the doors are I trample it somebody with this if you ain't never heard of me I'm about to show you what the Anthem is

Title: Mazda RX7 FD Type RS - Walk Around
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZeCj6xkYD0

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys welcome to the vlog in this episode I'm going to do a walkthrough on my master or x7 type RS I've managed to get out here on the weekend and I'll see it's a lot of you guys in the comments section and I'm actually quite busy you can't get out we had one cancellation or something and I'm here at the car so let's do a quick walk around on us so this is a 1997 type RS this is the car that are imported in January and it just arrived now on the 17th of May so let's walk around take a look at the body now the grading sheet from the auctioneers was a BB if you guys aren't sure what a BB grading is it means that the car is pretty good and there's not many issues with it however there are things on here that I've found that weren't on the auction list for example I don't know if you can see this but there are some really really large scratches here fortunately these are not linked deep so another polish that will

(Start: 00:01:02)
come out let's take a walk around I'll show you this car so on here this is been scratched not so much scratch it's been bumped somewhere so the polish that looks like that out either there's a bunch of resergy around the back here that's just dirt lift the wing sort it out it'll be quick and easy to do this little paint chip over here that I did not know about that was not on the grading sheet wheels are not so agreeable I'm going to swap these with the BBS's on the black or x7 the cars got these little spats over here now these camera Ridge me with the type RS it's got that in either sign and then it's got the same thing over here so let's quickly look at the black one and you see the difference doesn't have the space nice test okay so this is

(Start: 00:02:03)
indeed a type RS there were a couple people in the comment section and we stated it possibly might not be a type RS so those are one of the tell-tale signs that it is a type RS another one I'm just going to blur this out but there's a vehicle information sheet here and it is type of a special edition the Reuters on this car a lot bigger than the black one so as the rears the front another front of three one for 314 millimeters of these now check out the black one you can see that a lot bigger than ones in the black now first of understand a little bit through the back so you can

(Start: 00:03:03)
see hopefully but you can see how much lower the front of that car is compared to the black one so the type RS came equipped with Bilstein suspension it came a couple of bigger brakes the rotors with Rhian formula in the front back to a lot larger I'm not too sure on the size the differential was four point three ratio I'm not sure the stock one is but it is different to all the stock FD s and it's actually the same diff that the type RZ it has this RS also has a strut brace which the others can come with and there's a few minor things like the spats etc so little additions that the other cos don't have let's carry on all from where we left off there's a little bit of clear-cut damage over here that's pretty easy to fix I can do that myself everything is OK on the sides just a little bit dirty obviously this car needs to be washed and cleaned I haven't done anything yet

(Start: 00:04:03)
doesn't know about either on the grading and the auction sheet there's nothing here but these are little chips and they paint deep so a little bit annoying about that but I can fix that there's no dance in the car and found any yet clear crack damage here I knew about this one that was all I knew about and it was a scratch in the front somewhere I knew about that too the rest of stuff I don't know did you guys just hear the superior okay so this is where the rest on here obviously I'm going to pull out the writers I'm going to fill out the calipers I'm going to change the pads and whatever is rusty I'm going to rip out and do what I did to the black car get it all sorted out some large scratches over here large scratches here let's not paint deep I can suck it out this is easy to sort out the lots of them yellow bumper sagging this is a

(Start: 00:05:05)
typical rx-7 thing or FD thing around the black cars got it as well bumper is sagging loss is yellow now this is what I knew about on the grading sheet that little scratch that little chip so let's let them know about the cosmos a little Center capsule the wheels now these are the stock wheels that came with the car this car is 100% stock everything is fine on this side there's no issues clear-cut damage again over here I did not know about this everything else is OK the car doesn't need to wash the bill in a month now there's a little piece of rubber that's hanging out there tiny little I every month that's just it now the time I'm spending with you guys talking in this video is as much time I've actually spent with this car there's a little chip over there didn't

(Start: 00:06:05)
know about that this one will come out with polish Tiffany come out of polish no issues anywhere else that's just dirt obviously there's a little bit of residue and dirt over here this will come out pretty easily just lifts the wing get that sort of that a lot looks good there is some scratches here but this is not paint deep that will come out very easily and stuff I use is McGuire's scratch X gets a little spat day again top RS stuff and we're back to the beginning so this is a type RS it isn't a hell of a lot better condition than the black car let's take a look at the interior are talking about keys I'll show you guys something so they gave me three sets of keys I've got two with me one of left at home now

(Start: 00:07:05)
the anti-claus key see it turns my issues unlocks lock the door this key doesn't be the third key that I've got it opens the card works on all the barrels ignition etc they gave me the one key for the wrong car whoever owns fd3s on three I have your keys I have your key rather get back to the interior so on the beach side of things carpets and good neck just needs to sort out the placement there is a CD shuttle you see the shuttle thingy look at that just you know I have not networks its opening

(Start: 00:08:05)
closed more than likely little spare wheel it's got a little tools there more tools over there I can see all these panels here there's no scratches there's nothing wrong with them a lot scratch on there I just did there lookin up this car is in brilliant condition and sorry I'll just need to make a correction on something this call is actually a C be graded C being the exterior and beeping interior I messed up now I'm sorry Gus everything's in place here everything's airtight I've been in the car already closed the doors everything's fine it's got the same kick panel that the black one has got I don't know if this

(Start: 00:09:07)
was an optional extra on aftermarket thing but these little pieces of rubber are breaking off the bocal from the black one as well as you saw on the other side I was hanging out the door call came with two mats some reason I'll leave that in for now and it's given because I've got that 5-speed manual on here now the throw on this is actually pretty close what's a lot closer than my GTR there's a pretty long and shitty and hazard strings pretty cool in here as you guys can see is really good condition on the interior this was broken the knob that sits on here the inside piece was correct I've pulled it off already I'm going to be using some plastic cement I don't know if you guys have got Q bond in the states but I'm gonna use some key bond get that back together rebuild it

(Start: 00:10:09)
and pop in and we'll be brand new again - bored no bubbles nothing wrong as it looks fantastic a little bit of oil in the - awesome - p9 it is sorted out very quickly compartments perfect condition doors perfect we see that kick pattern at the bottom or scratched as well just like mine that's what you get with aluminum seats is in near perfect condition all these little compartments are open enclosed nothing wrong with them the black rx-7 this one was broken socket daisuki rip it open which is sitting on here being held by this little hinge over here compartment over here I can see that my issues the speaker doesn't work I was missing round of it and let's get the caught on and that's the key for the

(Start: 00:11:10)
other dudes rx-7 okay if you can see the aerial shoots up when the radio comes on that's pretty cool this is not a front later so this doesn't come out doesn't open my compass CDs in here this link to the changer oh hello that is my electronic toll collection system my etc' that sits over there I was missing round these buttons push this car and she talks again cigarette lighter aircon is working I have tested the and everything else works and lots pop up my issues Peter works when he not is

(Start: 00:12:10)
where I'm going to throw them on now's no water yeah be honest because I am not keen on starting up this car because for one I had to drive it to two meters from where I dropped the car off and the oil pressure was sitting roughly about one point five to two bars nails going up so  myself I had no option I had to get the car off the trailer and drive it here because the trailer was in fit up the driver so a lot particular keen on starting up the car because I don't know what fuel is in it and I don't know what oil is in it and how much oil and how much radiator fluid knowledge that I'm going to come back and I am going to do a service on this car I'm actually going to be servicing the GTR and this car at the same time and I'll be making two videos from that one is I'm going to do a mega JD and walk around and I promise to you guys that I was going to put it up for the next video but since I have some some want to come see the car and I figured I'll take you guys with me so I'm going to come out of two videos after this one is going to be a service on the GTR and a service on my type RS

(Start: 00:13:13)
on this car I am going to be doing an oil change oil full time I'll be doing the fuel filter I'm going to be doing radiator fluid draining it obviously draining the oil and I'm gonna drain petrol tank and I want to throw some octane booster in its and decent monty 5 octane fuel the GTR I am just doing a standard oil change nothing else to it everything else has been done in dribs and drabs oil change it's been it's been about eleven twelve months since obtains the oil it's up for change let's take a look at the engine back ok this engine is completely and utterly stuck there is nothing done to it here the thread pressure I was talking about as the type or a strut brace the standard air box April to civility here is the two turbo pops one to be sitting at the bottom one to be sitting at the top here somewhere

(Start: 00:14:15)
nothing is not so great but this is every day and there's another one back there somewhere so all the stock pops if you guys remember on the black one I'd have this piece as well this is completely broken Orpheus I had to just put some piece of silicone and yeah okay this little candle here it's missing bolt now gasps bear in mind I'm seeing this stuff for the first time with you so if you see anything let me know if I missed something that is obvious and should be sorted out please let me know this is a battery cover thing look at that it's actually really neat the black one doesn't have this cover at all black one does have this doesn't have those air box obviously it's got this HKS intakes over here as it will fall so every day that's cool black on definitely doesn't have that so you get a bolt and sort it off all of this dirt

(Start: 00:15:19)
doing just lightly scratching a little key metal command obviously I'm going to detail this entire engine back in RC soda so as you can see it's got the stock awful to hear the uim needs a bit of the cleanup the other than audio RMS this is the upper intake manifold can see it's just a little bit dirty as a bit of corrosion nothing a wire wheel went sort out this is all just some extra water sprayer came off somewhere maybe it was a bit of a leak but all in all it's a damn good condition so guys that is my rx-7 type RS that was a walkthrough video for that like I said the next video will be a service on this car and a service on the GTR and then I'm going to do a walk-through a mega JDM walkthrough on all three cars at the same time because thanks so much for joining us and I will see you all next time

(Start: 00:01:02)

basically said you can't release the vehicle you contact a vehicle in Philly provide us with X paper ignore that paperwork because any required during the licensing of the car so we try to fast it we're trying to lift the embargo in the car and they just we're in budging so apart for the paper we're going to takes three to four weeks and that's a plus - Thomas how long it took for the other two cars like we're exhibiting on GTR but on the paperwork itself as soon as it can take up to 120 days which is scary because I'm paying roughly between $40 and about 80 or 90 dollars if the variable Fiat changes every single day but doesn't get it doesn't exceed 80 or $90 America so I've been emailing and fining but obviously without harassing and just actually being very friendly in the emails apologizing for asking which maybe I shouldn't be doing anyway so I sent about seven emails and I had two responses to those emails so I've been trying to get hold of the person that's

(Start: 00:01:00)
obviously I'm on the garage with GTR right yes and I've got a few things to tell you dude so one I've figured I need to up my logging game upon one charges quality's not so great so I'm using a Canon a 6/6 NHS which is what I'm currently filming us right now and it's quadrille arranged GP cameras is left of screen only thing I could I'm going to continue using this camera for vlogging until I get a g7x but I decided to up my gammit into montages what I did is I bought myself a DSLR so it is a basic one right over here this is a Canon 1200 be here is 1200 E it's got that 18 155 millimeter lens I think in the state is called t5 rebel I don't want to pass something that's expensive because I don't know I'm really going to be getting into this whole montage thing and I might just be

(Start: 00:02:01)
able to get away with this camera now I'm going to flip across this camera in a sec but I figure I'll give you guys a little update so one this car needs the service so I bought some engine oil got Castrol GTX 10w 40 about 1020 w 50s for the top area soon as it arrives I've got two bottles of antifreeze and some general service items I've got brake pads little for the top RS this needs to go on a few rows of this prefers for the down pop it's black dang it so it's some heat prep time in directing the downtown first cover raised enough that you can see it yeah what the reso is possibly I need to put on the radiator pops and then I've got the Odeon candles that I need to change now this the camber of a probably win

(Start: 00:03:03)
are moving to the big house and a little space in the world to work with so right now I am struggling a little bit for space the other thing I want to do and I might be doing pretty soon is my brake calipers are still yellow those need to be real so I'm going to off or pull it off respray it let's go do that and then I've got a few months that are going to be going on the new rx-7 type RS the first one is I've got a each case exhausted I may be throwing on second is I've got the HKS super power flow in techs now those are coming off the black car now what I'm going to be doing is the rx-7 Type R is the silver one is completely and utterly stuck I'm going to leave all the stock puts across the black or examine the new whatever's modified on Konerko so one with HKS Intex on the black or exit put the standard in text and a box on the soft one I'm going to swap the silver ones exhaust which is standard on CA the black rx-7 but then of an HKS

(Start: 00:04:04)
exhausting hang on the next thing is I bought a couple silicon couplers and silicone hoses vacuum hoses are also stuffed in purple maybe dressing the engine bay off that are exceeded in purpose that's going to be slippery I'm going to go for that hole do you like kept look and they're not do you like hoses they don t like Campbell splash root keep it's the same color Federico obviously once the cars here I'm going enjoy it in stock form I'll do a review on the car proper review I want to do my first review in that car it's going to be in stock form do a few laughs modification of the car drive it again and tell you guys what it's like ok so let's take a look at this camera and then I want to tell you a little bit about what's happening DTR so I'm not going to go into it on the camera side if it's pretty basic or it is a DSLR but this is the most basic of the lot so I'm just going to do the toggle and take it across into camera mode and we're going to flip across to that camera rocker

(Start: 00:05:09)
[Music] [Music] okay we are on the big camera with DSLR I've got a six manual focus right now I'm still getting used to this camera so my plan is to use this for montages this is actually the first time and banks I'm filming with this camera right now take a few photographs my daughter and family stuff but I only got it about two days ago the other two people I believe the autofocus is up to shed on this camera let me pop up in the engine where you guys and take a look so I'm not planning on vlogging with this camera it's a

(Start: 00:06:09)
little bit too big a lot of guys that night for me I do want to get a t7x and roll that this is just very pretty for montages so guys this look quite a bit of work that I want to do on this engine bay and obviously that's cleaning this up I do want to change the color at some stage of this so if you guys have any ideas what would go thread I am going to keep the red finishes a red hoses and other stuff give me an idea what does change the color of my covers so let me know I still need to finish this you can see here in the futile pieces here that I still need to do some standing on but for the most part is looking pretty decent I need to get rid of all these clamps change the clamps put tee-ball clamps on Sneden everything up they still this pop over here the still needs to change the hard part they are hard pops that are running to the intercooler those are done it's just the engine bay side someone put stock pieces

(Start: 00:07:11)
and for some unknown reason so I need to change that okay but as there was a little bit of an update as to what has been going on and what I'm planning on doing another last two videos have been update videos it must be shitty figures but like I said in the previous video I've been a little bit respondent that this can cover it's done in the ports and you've been detained by customs let's hope that I get this car out this week and I can start making some decent vlogs again I do plan on making some driving videos with this car obviously I'm going to be some location shooting gamers cry out to location meet em somebody's doing some shoot some they cause I'm not planning on doing photo shoot or anything I want to do video montages because this - the update that I have for you because before a final for the channel I wanted to tell you guys to take a look at someone's channel because I know I am one of the smallest auto bloggers if that's what you call it but I like to help out the community with whatever I can and I don't have many subscribers and a limited views but with what I get I like to help promote

(Start: 00:00:00)
morning guys welcome to the vlog you've probably been wondering where have I been and where is money rx-7 the rx-7 is still currently detained at port I found out last week Tuesday that they would not release the car until I give them additional paperwork and it's been a fight to get the car out of Port those paperwork isn't actually gear now the paper if they requesting now is paperwork there there's only g4 licensing in the vehicle so this kind of threw me off now I mean I've done this twice already with the black or except and I've done this with RPG GTR and it was smooth sailing soon as the car arrived up applied my paperwork my import permits etc and I was able to get the car out the following day unfortunately with this one when I applied for my import permit the guards that provide an elders permit they put the wrong import-export number or at least mine for export number they put a generic code which only allows you to bring in an import vehicle up to a

(Start: 00:01:01)
specific value so we have to get a special request going and that means the corn use and inspection which wasn't a big deal so they did the inspection the car passed chassis number engine number everything married up everyone was happy I then found out on Tuesday last week that they're not going to release the car with additional paperwork and that paperwork is not needed right now however I can't fault the system I'm kind of stuck at the moment we try to lift them border on the car unfortunately customs is just not interested in helping that already care about situation suppose their job just to follow procedures long story short I've applied for the paperwork on the cheese I found that I needed I applied for everything and now I'm waiting other side works except to the speech three weeks now I don't mind that I don't have the vehicle with me the big issue is that I'm currently paying 500 grand a

(Start: 00:02:02)
day plus - which is roughly about $40 per day for storage from day one they've seven it's 1,000 something round which is about 80 or 90 dollars and then it comes back down to about 500 and back up mm and I paying this per day for the car just to sit outside in the Sun angered image so to also other question is we have our being honestly speaking I've been a little bit despondent and I didn't really want to put out a video and when I work on the car beam into my garage once a class I've looked at the gt-r having done anything which casita rx even loss not the black one I just had no energy to work on it just think about something for a second here imagine you've been researching and wanting a specific product for a very long time now you know the products coming on each state and you're super excited you're gonna get collected on each state you then find out that it's not available you're

(Start: 00:03:05)
going to come back on one date which is the following week your carry that you then find out that why date is not going to happen it's not going to be the date and their date is an unknown date plus extra money to be spent so honestly speaking I just haven't had the energy to put out the video or do anything but I am back now I'm going to post content weekly this was probably the longest time that I've been away from YouTube and posting which has only been a whole six days but I don't throw in some filler content with that Ford Focus RS so the next thing I'll tell you guys is last week I got together with a bunch of friends our good friend the morning arc and there was a photo shoot that was happening and the guy said please come please bring a car and it was pretty cool I took my car across there and there was a professional photographer and he'll end up taking photos of everyone's car and I am lost he landed taking when shredders Markov so they kindly on the screen now they look fantastic so he's a great photographer I just wanted to

(Start: 00:04:08)
thank him but asking some of you guys to show them a little bit of love on Instagram and Facebook so you can add them on Instagram at Tarzan I do and on Facebook every been fair Nigel's both links in the description and in this flashing on the screen right now [Music] [Music] I'm super stoked with the way that the photos came out it was obviously unexpected I didn't prep the car as much as I'd wanted to and probably should have clean up the car little bit better please get some good credits but so even

(Start: 00:05:08)
sharing on the DMS and christen he's trying to build up his failure so I'm going to allow him to take photos of the black rx-7 and when the silver one comes into quitters and perhaps will do 3,000 percent off the girl showing some love on Instagram chimes love and Facebook the last thing I said to girls about it was an update video that I put out a couple weeks ago and was explaining so many big that was happening in my life and if you don't know what it is my wife and I we bought a house a couple months ago and we were only supposed to be moving in August September it turns out that are you going to be getting off since a little bit earlier and you look at about gmos right so there's a bunch of innovations I want to do before movin I'll get the keys in June July I'll be moving house but there might be a week or so where there won't be a Content turn or more than not to make some filler content just to tick you guys going now the good thing about moving houses I'm going to have a whole lot more space that also means that I can

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_OU9Q9x9Kk

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey dudes hope everyone as well as you can see by this title not the best of news the car arrived yesterday well at least the ship arrived yesterday and I received a nice message that customs is going to be detaining the call for further inspection and some questioning so we made a booking forward today and I've actually filmed the whole thing I've logged it made a booking for today at 9 o'clock I went off this morning 9 o'clock to the port I got picked up by the customs officer just outside he took us through to the second-hand car locks and the car wasn't there so I went to go figure out what I was going on and it turns out that the rx-7 was one of the last cars left on the ship out of the 6000 plus and well we had to wait for it so it took them a little bit of time so you actually get the call to shove in in that time the customs officer said to us sorry he can hang around he's going to

(Start: 00:01:01)
leave us here soon as the car arrives late in life so I'll ended up filming and we set there until almost 1:00 p.m. so a good couple of hours for hours actually we stood there for good couple hours and eventually we were starting to get a little bit frustrated and myself and the clearing agent that we're using we decided that we're going to start moving closer and closer towards the shipping area so I have footage that I want to show you guys on a car show year so I'm going to show you once the call comes out of the port and once I get a customs clearance the first time it's happened a little T cause we're quick and easy the car arrived oh they will pick it up the following day this one has now been detained now I managed to see the car show you guys a quick little snippet of it but I got to witness something that many people don't get to see and obviously I don't think it's legal what we did because we did get stopped by security

(Start: 00:02:03)
right at the end and we had three security events pull up next to us a bunch of security guard jump out questioning who are we what company from while we here what permits do you have all sorts of questions and they removed us from sight so that was an interesting experience but prior to that I got to see stuff that not many people see especially of their own vehicle I stood right next to the ship that it was coming off I saw the car coming down the ramp I waited for two hours staring at every single car that came out we used etc folder couple there were smell teasers and things that are coming out nothing of interest eventually I saw Marek seven without the camera and I managed to film it it then took quite a bit of time actually to come through the scanning area so we decided to go even further even closer and there are a

(Start: 00:03:03)
couple issues and then we managed to see the car coming out and then going off to the drop zone and before we got to do anything well basically got swatted and security all over me and I'm gonna toss that aside so the update is now I contrary this footage until the car comes out of there and cleared and I don't want to jeopardize anything to do it was called being let out of customs so one I'll show you quick little snuff in a second but the car is going to be inspected on Tuesday I'm going back they choose their morning for the inspection it looks like a might be okay once the inspections over hopefully wins there or Thursday I'll be able to click the call so I'm going to have to go live with the trailer because you can't drive the car out pitch the car and bring it back home I've got to see the car up close and personal I obviously couldn't take my

(Start: 00:04:04)
vlog camera and I had to use my cell phone so the footage is not up to par but I did manage to get footage in well you're not supposed to take cameras and all that sort of stuff away so cuz that's the update I was hoping to have the call tomorrow that's not happening I'm going to get the call next week it was cool seeing the car and it was such a really good experience and let's hope thumbs that I get the car next week and there's no issues because thank you so much for being along for this journey and I will see you guys next time that's my car beautiful Thanks [Music]

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] what's up guys and welcome to the vlog you're probably wondering why I've got this with me I decided to go to swap cause my GTR is sitting where this one

(Start: 00:01:00)
was and now this one's here I can do some work on the car so if you remember in the last video this car was smoking heavily it was awesome misfiring cause it's about a thicker call for the CR and it's making lyft no offence making the problem seems to have gone away it's not smoking anymore something is firing anymore the cars driving fine it's strange someone in the comments section if she said that it happened to their car to happened for a couple of minutes and it's never done it again maybe it's nari seven thing I don't know this cost set for a very long time it's probably set for about two months without being driven to get it started once in a while but not as often as I would like to you today I'm just gonna tinker with the calm just gonna play around look at a couple things and my take out spark plugs check them out I don't let just clean up the car dudes a few guys with OGIS on the channel you remember in December when I picked up the car and I started heating it up that I found that this call is full of pubic hairs that's right puce this call is riddled with it I'll show you the clip

(Start: 00:02:01)
Roylott there are just pubes everywhere in my pants really never happens you can take my word I want apologize that's just absurd I'm pretty sure this dude whoever in the car got down in the car okay maybe there weren't really pubes but more so dog hairs I'm allergic to dogs so I keep sneezing and so it's cause I'm very cool for me to drive around so I'm gonna evacuate that's one thing I'm gonna do and I'm just going to clean up the engine bay just give it a nice little key okay here's the engine bay can see there's some stuff cut out on a cleanup so this is corrosion from water obviously so dang that could take hours or months if you guys can see this stain that's on here this is the very dot system that the the guys put in for this dated dotting it looks terrible I don't know what the hell they were doing it's all over the Santa it's I'm all ruffled top paint so I don't

(Start: 00:03:02)
even know if I can take this off I'm gonna do a very very boring thing with the car that I and it's just cleaning up I'm gonna start looking at things like was getting that end up cleaning up some of these nuts if I've got replacement you

(Start: 00:04:27)
let's use my drill and wire wheels and it's looking pretty good so this is the first parts that I've done you can see it's not exactly even all over but I'm going to leave this for now and I've got other things to do I'm just gonna clean it up clean up all the dust that I've now sprayed all over the place because I probably should have put a vacuum cleaner here while I was doing that but anyway that doesn't happen I'm gonna clean up all the dust and I'm gonna get two other things one thing that's rather annoying is that so we're not drop the bonnet the windscreen wiper keeps getting caught so I haven't figured out what it is yet probably need to readjust that bolt over there so have a look at those so bonnets going down now see it's getting caught they're not cool all right so I'm gonna

(Start: 00:05:27)
take a look at that now quickly that's not good just nice as this car is leaking some sort of oil that's right date of birth but I know what that's about that was me just looking at the ast just making sure that it actually is connected everything that's fine I'll ended up pulling out the one a little bit of radiator fluid ran out so I've topped it up ready but this oil in the floor is whirring and I need to fix that before this car does its tests

(Start: 00:06:36)
you kind of side of that Muppet sound was a bit too excessive so just touching this guy I haven't tested it yet because there's people around and I don't want to get thrown out of yet before I actually do so guys that's it for the vlog I'm gonna be going away this weekend we're going through the Drakensberg mountains to little family some yes it's hard to believe but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world it's now the Drakensberg mountains of course Zulu natal the entire African continent is risen several thousand feet and had likely never even flooded [Music] I probably won't be in the comment section or anything like that if you're looking for me sending me messages I'll

Title: How Much Does It Really Cost To Import A Skyline?
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDlsJzMzsKA

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys welcome to Nell Kel JDM vlogs in this episode I'm going to tell you how much it really costs to important r32 GTR so the purpose of this video is to share some lar to my fellow South Africans as I'm currently getting bombarded on a daily basis with questions asking about import costs how much does it cost to bring in r32 how much does it cost to bring an rx-7 what are the shipping charges all sorts of questions relating the importation of a vehicle to South Africa now I don't mind answering these questions it's just getting a bit tiring because there's all sorts of different people from different platforms asking me I don't particularly want to copy and paste a generic message so I figured I'd make this video so guys don't get me wrong I appreciate that you asking me and it means a lot to me that you are asking me but unfortunately I can't answer everybody the way I'd like to you so I'm putting up this video so this video in particular is one an r32 GTR and before I start I'm just going to give you one piece of the bus the car is 25 years old the car is old things are

(Start: 00:01:02)
bound to break things are bound to deteriorate and it's going to cost you money so the general rule of thumb and the way I've looked at it is if you can't afford to GTRs don't buy the one now in saying that it could be a different story if you are going to garrage the car now I don't drive mine a lot so I don't see these issues I haven't had anything major break on me yet however I only drive a thousand kilometers per annum that's roughly about three tanks of fuel so I'm going to refer to the exporter that I used as exporter X I haven't asked him for permission on making this video so I don't want to throw the name around so if you guys have put two and two together you'll know who the exporter is and we're going to look at a price on a GTR at ten thousand dollars now ten thousand dollars is roughly bottom of the range or thirty-two GTRs you need to spend a little bit more but I mean that's something completely different topic now now X charges you eight percent of the value of the vehicle now

(Start: 00:02:05)
that eight percent is their taxes now this is a Japanese standard for Texas eight percent you get charged at eight percent then you get charged a recycling fee now I'm not too sure the recycling fees and then never really bothered asking up just been paying for it it's not expensive it's roughly thirty dollars in there's a shakin fee now the shakin fee is your D registration and registration costs now that is $30 then there's an auction fee now this auction fee it includes photos and videos of the car includes translations and some basic guidelines to assist you in purchasing your JDM vehicle now that's a hundred and fifty dollars then there's delivery of the car from the auction house to we export to excess and that could go up to a maximum of a hundred and eighty dollars so for example my recent auric seven that I purchased was in Tokyo and to get it to export it X it cost a hundred and sixty dollars I guess obviously a hundred and

(Start: 00:03:06)
eighty dollars a full-thickness the way I I'm guessing so let's work on one hundred and eighty dollars being the maximum for that then there's another mount that you pay and that's for their services and that's four hundred and fifty dollars so let's say now that you've bought this car and it cost you $10,000 once you add up everything that I've spoken about you're going to be paying eleven thousand six hundred and forty dollars now you're going to take this figure you know times that by twenty five percent now that is the amount that you're going to pay for customs duties in South Africa now these duties are specific to having a collector's item vehicle so 25% on eleven thousand six hundred and forty dollars gives you fourteen thousand five hundred and fifty dollars and that's just for the car now they're still shipping now shipping CIF which is your cost insurance and freight you're roughly looking at about a thousand two hundred dollars from Japan to South Africa okay so now you're gonna add

(Start: 00:04:08)
thousand two hundred dollars on top of that once you've got that figure now you're going to convert that to rands now the current exchange rate we're looking at roughly two hundred and twenty one thousand and for the vehicle now we're going to convert the dollar amount to R and figure and turan figure at the current exchange rate which is just under 14 ran to the dollar it's gonna work out to 221,000 R and that's right 221,000 round on $18,000 vehicle then there's a customs agent fee and thus varies from different custom agencies but there's a lot of them out there so you can do some pro shop in beforehand we need to provide them with as the shipping details when the ship is arriving what ship it's on and obviously how much you paid for the value of the vehicle you don't need to give them your bill of lading or anything like that just to get a quotation I found a specific one that charges about 1/5 and obviously that's work for me because the cause have been cleared and they've come

(Start: 00:05:08)
through and I've got the vehicles now that you've got those amounts then you need to pay that all taxes now versus African vet is 14% now you're gonna pay 14% on the total amount so it was there two hundred twenty one thousand plus the one five and all the other extras so what it's going to come to now is two hundred and fifty one thousand nine hundred and forty year end so now once you've got those figures you're gonna be paying fourteen percent of that now that is what's Africa charges for your taxes now paying 14 percent bets on top of that is gonna give you a figure of two hundred and fifty one thousand nine hundred and forty year and you cannot claim this back as a business expense because you have to reach to this car as a personal vehicle as a collector's item so there's absolutely no way that you can claim this Evette legally now the rest of the stuff is relatively cheap in comparison to purchasing the vehicle so one is our tech they provide the import pyramid that's absolutely free to is the

(Start: 00:06:10)
NRCS that's your national regulates of compulsory services that works out to 1900 Rand then there's the EU COC the EU CRC is only required if the car is newer than 1997 okay so in my case I've had to do it for both our exhibits and that sort of cost of roughly about 3,000 random then you've got Weybridge charges which is roughly about 150 ran in this data da ting or very darting which is anywhere between 400 and 550 R and then there's your normal stiphu kind of roadworthy charges which is anywhere between 300 and 500 REM now I need to do those twice you also require a police clearance or an RP r3 or police clearing agency now that costs between 250 and 400 and then you've got your licensing fees now let's put nm and that's roughly 570 around so you're going to be looking at about two hundred and sixty thousand Rand on a car that cost you ten thousand dollars so

(Start: 00:07:11)
cuz those are the costs on importing a vehicle into South Africa those are all of the costs I'm currently doing it right now at the black rx-7 and I'm going to be doing it again with the silver rx-7 as soon as it arrives in exactly 22 days so I hope in some way this video has helped you and if I sent you here because you asked me some questions just know that I'm not trying to be rude I just get this asked a lot guys thank you so much for joining me be sure to hit that like button hit the subscribe button drop me a comment if you feel the need to and I will see you guys on the next video [Music] yo girlfriend on my scorecard opportunity knocks well someone please tell me where the doors are before I trample it somebody better answer this if you ain't never heard of me I'm about to show you what the is domestic

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys welcome back to Nell kil Jaeden vlogs in this episode I'm going to be doing my custom intercooler popping now I've already made the one this dude here basically this is a 45-degree bin on a 3 inch pop or 76 millimeter that's gonna be going on this side of the intercooler so the outlet from the 20 burpees this one I've had a bit of an issue with I couldn't get the rock band for that piece so I'm gonna leave it for now and put the stock one back on it's all we're gonna do is basically just get this guy on here I've cut it to size and I've done all my silicon doohickeys yes there's a piece that I had unfortunately didn't have the rod silicon pieces so I took chop this thing up now I thought I was clever so I was working in unsafe conditions trying to cut this thing and I did something very very stupid look away if you don't to see this understand flash on the screen very quickly I stabbed about an inch and a half of a Stanley blade into my leg pulled it out

(Start: 00:01:01)
started pissing of blood it kind of looks like sushi at the moment that's pretty gross I didn't get stitches I don't think I need any but said I'm a  idiot for one it doesn't hurt but I had a huge adrenaline rush they know he's in shock and then I felt really tired and went to sleep that was pretty much it anyway I don't want to bore you with that so I'm gonna care and working on the car and when I'm done I'm gonna tell you guys some very big news that's happening [Music] okay okay so just realize that I've  up with the clamps - so I have got it says that 79 to 87 probably should have been a bit bigger not probably its definition of so I'm going to use one old clamp and when you clamp it on I get some new clamps tomorrow [Music]

(Start: 00:02:33)
okay sorry for the sweeping I'm gonna take a break from this I'm working in a closed garage closed windows it's pretty hot I can't open windows and I can't work on cars we're live which is pretty shitty so I'm gonna tell future Nelson to let you guys know what's happening and they will come back thanks boss Nelson so I've got some news for you guys and I'm not sure how to start off but basically no I am NOT closing the old channel - no I'm not buying a new car not yet at least I'd love to buy another car but it's gonna happen in the near future what is going on is not a lot of people know this but my wife and I we bought a house and yes it's a cool place it's down the road from where we are now it's a big step for us because we've always lived in a gated estates and

(Start: 00:03:35)
we've always had security and I mean you negate to the state there's lots of people there the shipping is on we're gonna caused a quant make a lot of noise of quantities power tools I've got a single garage and it's a tiny single garage where I can only open up with one door my driver's door because of parks are close to the other side so if passengers were in the toilet to get out before they get into the garage so we've been betting a space for a while so we've been we had a plan to buy a house maybe two years Tom and we kind of saw a place awesome place and we bought it what's happened a couple weeks ago we walked in when you looked at a place we loved the place while we're daily put in an offer and we bought us now we're waiting a few more months I think it's actually deceased estate so it's gonna take a little bit longer we're probably looking about August that we'll be moving but the family that's in there now they could potentially to the occupation

(Start: 00:04:35)
we're in so they must stay in this a little bit longer I'm not going to take too much both house because I do want to keep a little bit of privacy but the last thing is it's got a big single garage I can actually open up both laws and the GTR there's a lot of space behind where I could set up tables work benches etc now initially we didn't want a single garage I wanted three garages exeter and I was going to budget to buy a house and freest um but you came across this place it's got double carport so I can fit two cars underneath this car for it's got space on the section to put about six cars obviously that single garage with a GTR on there and then this is the selling point this is Wally water they are plans that were approved to build another double garage on the premises and the granny flat so we probably won't ever build a granny flat because we don't want any other people living on our property but last

(Start: 00:05:36)
tonight we've got that and awesome thing is we can build those garages so in time I will build these double garages and fill it up with cars so enough ranting and raving I bought a house it's cool now the problem is I'm not gonna be able to fund buying cars and modifying cause as much as I love you and honestly I'm going to do the six hundred was quite great then I stopped it because I bought this other rx-7 now the big problem is I bought a house which means now that we're living on our own envyus we live in South Africa and you guys - Africa is very crammed friendly we need electric trips we need security beams in the outside we need a good alarm system we need a camera system there is a horror stuff that goes on so we want to be hinging around the house so it looks nice and neat we also want to knock down a couple walls build things and we want to renovate a little so unfortunately I'm not gonna be able

(Start: 00:06:38)

Title: Common Problems With The R32 GT-R

(Start: 00:00:00)
welcome to nel Calgarian vlogs in this video I'm going to tell you about the common problems of the r32 GTR and how to fix them before I start this video let's forget to lock and subscribe and help out the channel by sharing this video number one the infamous - bubble there is a rather annoying bubble that rises on the passenger side of the dashboard unfortunately this level has plagued many an owner essentially what causes the issue is the adhesive under the dash it is no longer able to secure the material in place when it lands up rising forming a bubble an easy fix would be spoke of small hole using a sewing needle or a pen this will allow the air to escape once this is done you can use a heat gun when hair dry out in the affected area to reactivate the adhesive after a short amount of time with your heat source a plot pressure with a downward motion using either an old credit card or a small block of wood number two ceramic turbochargers most off 32 GTRs will have the standard t25 turbo charges which are prone to failing above 1.1 bar or 15 point 5 psi this is

(Start: 00:01:03)
due to having a ceramic exhaust wheels which tends to get rather hot and the high pressure and more often than not falls off unfortunately there is no easy fix for this either replace it with new turbo charges or purchase replacement parts within chrome wheels which is referred to as steel however I'll tell you how to determine whether or not you have the ceramic wheels anyway that you can really tell is by removing your entire exhaust system this includes the back box down pops and jump ups once it was done you'll be able to see the exhaust side of the turbochargers it is still quite difficult to see but by maneuvering your yn and using either a mirror or a torch or possibly taking a photo you'll be able to tell the ceramic wheel has a 12-point double hex nut and the internal wheel either has a single hex six-point nut or triangle end in some cases number three gear grinding third and fourth gear grinding is a very common issue with the 5-speed trucks at higher rpm levels this is generally due to the throwing direct and the driver smashing the gear in hard whilst this is not a real fix for it this will help

(Start: 00:02:04)
with the grounding and will eliminate the noise by using a quicker oil a commonly used oil to resolve this would be the redline heavy in shockproof and it is highly recommended by mania skyline form number for permanent break lots this issue stems down to a plastic switch stopper just above the pedal which disintegrates you to old age it makes the brake lights stay on indefinitely causing your battery to drain very quickly as per the drawing you can see how easy it is to fix this problem you'll just need to replace the nut or put in a plastic stopper the hardest part is trying to put underneath the dash without being a contortionist or some sorts anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this video there are obviously a lot more things that can go wrong with the r32 gt-r such as the high caste system and the oil pump crank color I'll be sure to do more of these in the future and bring those up too till then don't forget to drop a lock topic comments and hit that subscribe button for weekly JDM content peace

(Start: 00:01:01)
JDM content I'll do some how-to guides and a couple of other things so a lot of cool stuff that's on the channel I'm gonna be starting doing some Corey views now that I'm showing my face that's the channel in a nutshell it is relatively small it's growing in numbers I've been a pretty bad week last week I've got a feeling it might have to do a YouTube age gate either that or I'll just make a shitty content and people unsubscribed yeah anyway it's it's slightly getting better so this is quite tough just looking at the lens and talking it's perfect because I can't see myself I don't have one of those g7x is I just got a normal canon sx60 HS and it's kind of doing the job but obviously I need to invest some more money into bitter camera equipment stuff so I was gonna buy a DSLR chem 1300 D or possibly the knock on 3300 D I'm not really sure anymore for want to go that route it'll be nice to have one of these DSLRs but then I can't see myself and more blog channels you

(Start: 00:02:01)
guys tell me what you think what's better anyway enough rambling what I'm gonna be doing to the car to not is super boring right yeah okay so someone sent me these this is fan mail from someone called Sylvia who's on the channel and I do a little video about it kind of haven't been in here since then and there's a random pop just lying around okay so what I'm gonna do today is super boring and that is try and take this off by hand because I live in the gates of the state and we're not making noise off your set and Tom and we're gonna use power tools so I'm kind of gonna scrape it off for now and then I'm gonna do a dremel another time but I've been itching to do this and I'm really keen on getting out of the way yeah not sure if you guys saw in the last video but I business HK is polish you remember it

(Start: 00:03:02)
looked like utter before so if you're looking pretty decent now so I'll just use some steel wool and I used some  I forgot of course metal polish not that one I don't try that no pretty shitty so I brought some water salt and it actually worked pretty well I was set with some steel wool and I kind of disrupted with us all and it's sort itself out so I'm pretty happy of the results okay so anyway it's cut to the chase this exhaust of the started now it's not kinky I'm gonna move those to you the off 32 GCR I'm gonna move the cocky my signals that's on the back of the r32 GTR now I'm gonna put that on the New York City that's coming a lot of you guys have been asking the same question what are you gonna be doing that silver or exhibit basically the plans are quite simple as soon as I get the car I'm gonna start doing the licensing paper once I get something called us to figure out of roadworthy I'm going to change the intakes and I'm going to swap it from the black auric 7 which is HKS super-powerful oh these ones but they

(Start: 00:04:04)

(Start: 00:05:05)
conditions so I'm actually gonna leave it for now the Australis and just get it done I'll probably land up if I'm gonna get good on Sunday now so I figured what I'll be now in its place is around water so so I'm gonna use this metal polish and then just shown up a couple things here so I never got around to a couple videos ago so they don't want it to clean up and read all the dust chassis and see how they're to the cars so just want to clean it up again not again I'm gonna clean it up now and I just want to use some middle product along these sort of things like the fuel rail that's so stuff on the side just get the car looking presentable so I'll do that now then I'll just put together a little montage before I put a montage on and sawn-off I just wanna tell you guys about something I'm gonna be doing a live stream on Sunday morning I know a lot of you guys missed out on the live stream that I did on Monday it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing so I don't really schedule it I just decided you know what it's time for me show my face tray guys who I am and and just talk

(Start: 00:00:00)
morning guys welcome back I was supposed to do a video this weekend doing work on the car battles raining a bit then battle to get the audio out in the garage world was raining what I wanted to do is just tell you guys about the car I've got better news and also some video footage of the car in Japan it's not the greatest footage the garden filming vertically which is and you're sick animated a couple second clips which is pretty annoying all in all the car looks good it's just a little bit dirty otherwise it's fun exterior no Dan

(Start: 00:01:24)
this is engine number external oil sports nolleke [Music] [Applause] so the other thing of the off-campus weekend is a little polishing that HKS exhaust a month so if you remember it I bought her a couple months ago it looked a little bit worse for wear and off mostly sorting it out so I'll just use some steel wool and I use some decent punish and I just post the exhaust came out looking really good so I think I'm going to fill it to the car sometime soon maybe this week and I'll do an exhaust test before and after but I'm happier that so as you can see it looks decent now I've also ended up filling that in one wing to the car I was trying the whole gloss spray that didn't work out so I love going maps and met actually ended

(Start: 00:02:27)
up looking pretty decent so it's offering it to the car and I'm happier that I'm pretty strict anything I need to get now is that Fujimura wing and then I'm pretty much done with what it looks like in the exterior I may just drop the car slightly it's a little bit too hard for me I'm on top and property has sent me a little tip I think that I'm pretty happy with the exterior of the car because this was just a quick update on what's been happening with the car there's some stuff that's happening at the moment that's pretty big for me I can really tell you too much of what's going on right now but it it's really big and it's going to be a game-changer for everything it's in the process okay share quantity it's here right now as soon as I can give you some solid info on telly deeds but I just want you to know that it's it's time-consuming and I'm hardly stressed about things

(Start: 00:03:30)
right now but I'm still gonna get out videos I'm still gonna get out decent quality content but my frequency might change slightly imagine still one a week instead of about two a week and the other news on the car unfortunately they were not able to get the call on to ship those comics Africa Sina it's leaving on the 26th of this month so 26th of March 2017 and it'll be here on the 28th of April 2017 which is a Friday and they're going to need two days to hopefully the car it's coming on the ship which is packed as a Ray Rice I roll on they're gonna get the car off the ship it'll break me up and Sunday Monday is a public holiday so I can't pick up the car after wait till the next working day which will be a cheese day so I think the date for that was the second of April sorry 2nd of May was the date that

(Start: 00:04:31)
I'll be able to actually pick up the car so if she delays but at least the car is mine and paid for its booked for the show and I'm just waiting for my permits now as soon as I get my important parents make sure there's no necking do you see a way for it to get on the show but I'm gonna get my import payment hopefully this week and then I'll be pretty happy about things anyway guys that's the news that's happening right now I'll try and do some better videos or maybe at least another video this week I was supposed to do this one on the weekend so I'll definitely do something by the end of the week and I promise it'll be a little bit better than just sitting in the car driving and pointing to the camera at the dash and stuff anyway guys thanks so much and I'll see you next time oops [Music]

hey guys welcome to Nell Canadian plugs if you can hear me okay I've set up three cameras in the pub poker pros doing the dishes keep saying motor speed camera quad I swapped cards today from our digital camera in service and mastering this issue since obviously inferior card the reports for about 30 seconds this is processing in this it's off come any record over and I forget there I'll sort it up when I get to my parents place I'm gonna be doing some work from the rx-7 we're gonna be replacing that ast which is the air separation tank off that's done we're going to put in radiator third [Music]

(Start: 00:03:01)
I'm look for x7 kind of missed this card to be honest and here's the ast so my dad actually put this together remember in the last video it has splits on it so he had some plates that were lazy and cut this is top and bottom plates put drill the holes and you put grub screws and you put some sort of an epoxy around them and you know I've been spun I guess if you want to spend hundred pounds hundred thirty dollars plus minus and it placed us but for those car guess it's alright so I'm going to quickly flip this there's a puppy at the bottom if you can see those pop here it goes onto this car let's pop over here goes onto here and then there's one that goes the sky here it goes on today so I might

(Start: 00:04:02)
quickly flip this before I do so I want to show you guys something my dad's been busy with this course so I'm taking some of the rust off stuff I didn't really show you guys because I didn't really do a walk-around properly off the car so there are a couple of small rust spots on the top here there's about a seven or so tiny little one over there another one over there that needs to do but he started shaving us down I don't know exactly what the process is that he was doing specifically but I know this is hammer art and I think he's gonna sand it down some more than painted so he has a little rough spot that's he's busy sorting out same story sand it down ham rocks not sure what the process is next [Music]

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] hey guys welcome to the Vlog I finally got pictures of the RX7 and arrived today in ngoya so I figured I'd give you guys a little bit of an update what's happening so I've shown you pictures before but I'm going to show you the picture that I received today of the car a little bit more detailed so this is the car in the auction I have shown you guys in the Reveal video this is what I based my auction bit on it's it's neat it's stock and I've got confirmation that it's stock the only thing that doesn't belong in the car are these wheels I'm not sure what they are maybe one of you guys will know and there's an electronic electronic toll collection system which is this unit over here okay so I got sent pictures today couple hours ago of the car and this is what it looks like so unfortunately the pictures are a little bit small low quality but this is in the yard at Japan partner in NGA so this car is a b-grade exterior

(Start: 00:01:01)
b-grade interior it's got just over 100,000 km and it's stock which is the most important and you guys know why I bought this one it's also manual which is cool so let's just look in the background there's a red Supra over here I'm pretty sure that's an RX7 this I'm not too sure it could be an RX7 I don't know you guys might know this is definitely an R32 over here and this I don't know can't tell about the scratches and stuff but apparently there was just one little scratch in the front and one in the back caral got the stock twin Pops in the rear it's awesome this is definitely an R32 in the background looks like it could be a GTS maybe I don't know GTS model I don't know definitely not a GTR you can see by this lip that's going down on the

(Start: 00:02:03)
Bonnet so I think here's where that other scratch is on the back 102,000 km car looks like it was idling oil pressure looks good interor is neat very very clean interior it's got a JVC head unit it's got the usual flare in the back there electronic to collection system is sitting on this side seats are neat leather in the back seats in the front look great this one looks like it's got a little bit of we on it so side Bol string is gone nothing of conflicts otherwise the car looks good I mean these Gators look pretty damn good usually these Gators are the first to go they start getting crinkly and rotten so

(Start: 00:03:04)
this looks great this looks like it's sagging a little bit I can fix that steering wheel looks fine on the auction sheet it said there scuffs on the steering wheel and I think on that previous picture this one yeah there we go you can actually see them here a little few scuff marks from age which is fun and here's that sagging that's easy to sort out any this picture of the Interior is actually better but it looks good I'm I'm happy the steering wheel looks good Gates look good A little bit of dirt on the inside but it's fine okay engine bay is stock stock stock stock earbox stock intercooler stock everything stock popping I dig it it's actually really cool I don't know if the strut brace is stock or

not it's a type RS it's a 1997 type RS it may have come with a strut brace I'm not entirely sure this could do a little bit of a clean up otherwise it's really really good there's another view of the rear seats seats are clean all in all I think this was a really good buy so that's a fd3s 3L is the paint code I've just blurred out my my chassis number but that's it that's my car guys so it's going to get on the next ship to South Africa it should be here in about 3 to 4 weeks obviously when it arrives I'm going to do my whole collection video I might actually apply for a permit to drive this car instead of taking a tow truck to the port and collecting it and loading it um the car seems to be okay I I'll probably just get someone to come with and follow me home so what I'll do obviously when I pick it up I'll Vlog it getting there

the whole excitement and joy all that  that I did in the last video with the black one and then driving the car home guys I'm really Keen I'm happy to get this car I've been a little bit disappointed with the black one so the black one obviously being an auto and it was a bit of a cheaper buy had a lot of problems and it left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth and I think this is going to redeem the whole rotary and RX7 experience that I probably should have had from the beginning so I'm glad I'm getting this car obviously there'll be other JDM Cars that I'll get in the future but at least this is now my rotary unicorn I still don't know if I'm going to modify it if I do I'll probably keep the stock Parts Asad for example I'll keep the stock exhaust I'll keep the stock stock intake and I'll change those two out I'm not sure how Wild I'm going to go on this car I'll probably do some suspension work and definitely change out these wheels the wheels are ugly so guys just

morning Gus welcome to Nell Cal JDM vlogs I'm going to tell you dudes what are imported in this video but before I tell you I'm just gonna tell you about a couple of updates and why I haven't really been posting in the last week and a half so the good news is i bought myself a GoPro finally got some crazy extension so i can pretty much swivel around do whatever for me i need to do it in the car out the car etc any problem is the microphone is terrible and realize how bad it is when it's inside its casing and when you driving it's horrific so i need to buy myself an external marketing hence the reason why this is an overlay audio on top of what i filmed this morning i also bought myself this go be gorillas suction mount thing so i can pretty much stick it to any way on the car and i can swivel internet just like any other gorillapod so that's pretty cool i'm trying to invest slowly and submit equipment trying to get these logs in these videos better i'm hoping to get a gimbal sometimes i can make better montage vidéos and really produce some quality

(Start: 00:01:00)
stuff so I want to get a little bit more into this whole editing thing i'll change streets now i'm really enjoying anything and putting stuff up but without the right equipment are making  but we follow that i'm going to tell you do today about the car that I'm forcing and why i'm importing it and one of the reasons we'll bring it up and i'm doing it now because there's a little bit of a delay in the car robbing from Tokyo and I don't have pictures and videos citrus so I'm just going to show you the photos from the purchase the next thing is I managed to get out either rx7 and fix that AST so because i'm sure that is it's the ear separation tank the monastery is just removed once the minister said apart and while I was playing it out evil pcs break off their mobiles where the cops gone to go spray or said a whole unit detached itself SVP so all the stuff I'm talking about now this will happen over the course of about TV so I've had all this

took a standing off and I was happy little sinful and took a bucket to the front of intercooler measured and short answers etc  it to the front of the you know then washed out everything for newspaper they shall help me get any painfully Ralph and its greatest and i used some high heat enamel spray which is pretty cool and its high gloss over that looks really really good I might tell you guys now about the car that i'm importing i'm gonna have to start three weeks ago three weeks ago i'm passing my parents over to my house and I was just casually chatting to my father outside while we were heating and he was offering me a little bit more about this class before excited that's currently sitting in one of his garages and he says to me he locks if I like the shape of a Japanese car lock if he did remember and if you've been an OG on the channel about seven months ago I made a video talking about Japanese cause and JDM cars and

(Start: 00:05:05)
our extreme came up and I said this is the only car that my father locks that's Japanese or JDM so he approached me then and he said deluxe car how much so we got chatting and he said look he wants to import one himself he really likes it what's the process eccentric cannot do and we got chatting and we decided okay well why doesn't he take the black onyx able cause he doesn't mind that is an auto he'll leave a daughter he'll even of current state obviously fix it up and go from there any problem is my tech which is the international trade association something something else Africa so there is a clause that they have that you cannot sell the eastland higher etc the car for a period of two years after the date of registration and once I get the call register which will probably be another month maybe two months legally nobody other than myself

(Start: 00:06:05)
can drive the car unless I'm in the passenger seat now he doesn't care about this at all because he's got vintage bitter and classic cars etc that he panicked rouse himself they may be get started once twice a month that actually probably listing that and I pretty much never get driven so he doesn't mind so what's happened is he's going to be taking on this car it's gonna be urged my name in 2 plus minus years it's going to get lunch food across them and the cost we're going to stay on the channel I'm still gonna be doing some work on the car helping a matter that we still gonna be filming on the RX dinner which is cool now this is a bit of a long-winded story i'm at rocky but short but let me start looking at other cause then because i can always get an rx7 lights are on the future and i do you want to import other cool JDM cause I'll started looking at maybe getting a Cheeto slippery and the only series out that i can get are pretty

(Start: 00:07:05)
damn expenses that are allowed on the cause and a nation to connect with awesome the one we allow spring in is the colin mcrae commemorative edition in the 20tb the htl one is to achieve other is series there on twisters collectors options just yet and I don't particularly want any of these nice liberal reports would have been a two-door version 6 str that's really that anyone that I really wanted so see Bree out the way I just started to look at age 15 Silver's spec are unfortunately that's full of the connectors are lustful this here so hopefully it will come back maybe next year the following year and I can make a purchase or one of those sometime in the future so it's 15 us now out of the picture I then relocate the zebra in 2014 the Super's banned for importation into fabric as you collect is awesome so there's a long story behind it I'm not going to go into the detail now but I heard that it may possibly be coming back in the connect without them next

(Start: 00:08:07)
year I'm not $115 or any nine extra and if that's the case maybe they'll be super in the near future the next one is under NSX too expensive all the models too expensive I do want to own one one there but I need to focus on getting a nasty family home focus on my baby laughs family consider and buying calls and everything else just falls behind the honda nsx is out the window there were a couple hours of the phone looking at geodis ilagay st205 not on the collective's optimism if the 18 12 carlos sainz limited edition is on the collective look unfortunately already had one of them kilifi another one and then slowed looking mitsubishi Eva's we are slow bringing in evo 7 8 9 10 because they were solved in so African small quantities that we call bring us and however the evo sucks Tommy Mac in addition that is available to bring in and then I had some doubts about bringing in one and I'm just I'm

(Start: 00:09:09)
not ready for an EVO right now on the loves you have one but i'll probably get something more i can either save innovate because i really like the shape so that maybe has many options obviously i can't bring in at the scotland other than GTRs 33 34 are thinking about the three for the too expensive for right now i'll do an iron on the future the 33 I wasn't seashore else so that scrap that idea so what it was leave us was a couple other cool japanese cars but at the sauna if I thought it was now i'm never gonna do and i might as well just tell properly so i started looking another example probably not what you guys were here you guys must be full of being so do something cool by the japanese car so i've bought another master rx7 however this one is different i was looking on 2,000 spectrum with regards to auctioning a and i was

(Start: 00:10:09)
looking at a car that was lucky wanked on the exterior may be a little rough around the edges on the interior but had modifications like a takes the power of c intake exhaust theater lung things done maybe a bridge cause it might show speed boat motor so full of looking at that fat and the other side of the spectrum was a completely spot or x7 a level of losing a highly modified 14 I think a little bit 40 yield fifty dollars was plus life's worth living in grand I'll end up losing quite a good example when it came to mod slightly high mileage on he was about 140,000 a little bit to half of my lucky I wasn't sure what engine work has been done but I did know all the bolts on modifications and it was pretty neat so I landed up using this car I lost with her 15 others that were mostly stuck and then let's edit n minus T

(Start: 00:11:10)
stock at her father highly modified and then I received a phone call last week when I made it other video telling you guys that I wanna cook and I received phone calls think I want to call him happy now that day I bet it on quite a few of them and Atlanta being I like the third one for the day and I managed to play in my bowl talk and cross I went right up to my maximum bed and a letter of winning a completely stock example it's got stock exhaust it's got stock trim and the engine bay the interior is meat is anything the only modification has caused the electronic toll control system other than that completely stocked on the spec sheet there was one scratch in the thoughtful it was a lot scratch underneath the front headlock it was good in the interior which is cross the paddling looking at these auctions pictures it's very very clean and then

(Start: 00:12:11)
it was also scuff marks on the steering other than that nothing wrong with the car I mean it's got just under hundred thousand kilometers it was one owner garage car never seen snow never seen sells it rides so it's a super super super clean example it's a manual which is present a calf of dead one of medic on the black one which is rather shutting its kind of left a bad taste in my mouth of the rx7 I don't forget let me get this car manual stock cetera or another exhibit but it has to be manual because I kind of need to redeem rx7 although I have it fun fixing it up cleaning it up the future but I think fun for a change now I need to focus on the GTR and not be clouded by a dodgy or extended so now with the stock on how the dilemma is the or leave it stock do i modify it if i do modified i'll be the first business modified i'll be doing leading myself if i leave a stock cause

(Start: 00:13:12)
going to possibly appreciate and value either way i'm collecting is called and i'm not planning on selling them ever because that's the story a meeting another rx7 it's completely neat example it's a 90 97 type RS and it's a December nonce 97 so the last of the series Sims these are Hopi Nazi disappointed with my recent searches the black rx7 will stay in the vlogs for a little bit the salon is going to be here probably in about a month month in the bed summer there another collection but here bringing the car and we'll do a detailed review on the car I'm excited I mean listen ricotta I'm just gonna be able to drive I do not have any issues set up for me possibly verified come on a clinic 80 million bear in mind i'm spoon about more day across future thanks a lot to being who i really appreciated workers you've been giving me a good

loss for a while don't think it has a lot of a comment if you want to scrub the time i really appreciate it kiko schema next again look inside the baby i go to work don't do it for the money but that y'all got i got there bu essence what I mean oh man I got with more bars yo girlfriend on my scorecard opportunity macros I'm a please tell me where the dogs are before i trample it  somebody better answer this tips you ain't never heard of me about to show you what's a mother handsome

Title: How Much Does It Cost to Run A Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R?
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22-guSVOQxI

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys welcome to NC JDM Vlogs in this episode I'm going to tell you exactly how much it cost to run my nen skyine R32 GTR so this video is specific to my car and my purpose of ownership I bought the car in mid November 2013 it was a mildly modified example and it was of average condition at the auction house in Japan [Music] currently it's a weekend warrior it stays garage most of the time comes out to play most weekends for only a few miles at a [Music] time at a maximum I'm talking about 60 miles plus minus 100

(Start: 00:01:02)
km and guys my maintenance spend and fuel spend for the past three and a half years of ownership has equated to roughly 25,500 or $22,000 now fortunately for me nothing is really broken on this car nothing major I drive the car hard I push it I enjoy the car I'll work on the car and fortunately touch wood everything has been okay so what I've spent money on are service items now I can't tell you buy this car use it as a daily driver I know a lot of you guys are tempted to do that and you know what it might work for you but I'm pretty sure your maintenance costs will be double triple or even more and things will start breaking it is an old car it's nearing 27 years for most of the cars that are in the state mine is 93 so it's currently 24 years old it's an old car things are prone to break I know at

(Start: 00:02:02)
some stage I'm going to start to change rubbers and mounts and all sorts of things CV boots power steering it's just one of those things and it's inevitable things are going to break however mine is garaged just like my RX7 I don't drive it a lot so for me these cost a different so this is purely for weekend warrior car and the things I've spent my money on are I've done two Services myself when the car up and that's two Oil Changers of liqu Molly 10 w60 and new oil filters I've used two bottles of liquimoly cotch cotch is a protective coating that you'll pour into your engine and it glazes the inside I've done one fuel filter replacement I've done a set of spark plugs which your NGK two-step CER plugs I've done HKS super power flow filters I've replaced those one I've done my diff and I've done my gearbox

(Start: 00:03:03)
oil I've skimmed the brakes I've replaced my brake pads with EVC green stuff I've done my brake fluid change I've replaced my battery with a Varto unit that has lasted me a very long time that's lasted me just over 3 years brilliant battery I'm not sure if you can get it overseas but if you are looking for a battery get a v it's really good and finally I've done radiator flush and I've done radiator flu now those things are small maintenance items they're not expensive at all like I said roughly $2,000 obviously it excludes all modifications done to the car and fortunately for me nothing serious is broken and it's been an absolute pleasure to own and drive this car the next thing is I plan on going this whole 600 horsepower route I'm definitely going to let you guys know on the cost involved getting it to that level so I hope this video gave you a little bit more insight to owning one of these icon iic Japanese Legends feel free to ask me any questions anything you want to know

Title: Mazda RX7 FD Roadworthy Test!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DTxPKCKog

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys welcome to ncal JDM Vlogs it's Thursday afternoon I am in the RX7 I'm going to take it for the certificate of roadworthy now they're going to make sure the car is okay drivable everything's fine and I can get on the road with this licensing so join me on this journey it's going to be a quick one I'm definitely holding thumbs okay started up fun radio's working oil pressure is good let's [Music] go hey guys a little bit annoyed I just went through to the roadworthy place and

(Start: 00:01:01)
they were unable to proceed with the testing cuz there's some paperwork that needs to be handed in and I don't know about that they've changed the laws so apparently with the nrcs which is the national regulator of compulsory services for South Africa so you need something called an EUC and this document basically says the car complies to specific standards by the EU and it's only required for a vehicle that is imported in Africa that is 19971 01 now I wasn't entirely sure that I needed this or not because my car that I imported my R32 GTR didn't require this documentation previously so this is the only thing that I'm actually needing right now to carry on and get this car licensed I've been driving it around actually feels pretty good the rev counter doesn't work as you can see there's some capacitors that need to be replaced apparently it's a

(Start: 00:02:01)
common issue on this car my air conditioning doesn't work at all other than that the car is driving okay it's pretty solid so dudes driving around this car in its current form having an automatic is absolute sacrilege I'm not happy with it at all I'm dying to throw a manual gearbox on here but but you dudes know that I'm going to be spending all my time and all my effort on the R32 GTR once this car is fully licensed so for the meantime this car can sit with an automatic gearbox it's not that bad it still drives it still works it's still an RX7 See's a little bit of a pull only just hit 100

(Start: 00:03:04)
now just pushing the car around the corner like that I mean that was I went up to about 100 there 100 km an hour not miles and it just felt like the car had no torque whatsoever to me it feels like the second turbo is not working I need to get this boost gauge sorted out I haven't had a chance to pick up a holder so it's kind of sitting over there I can't see what it's doing um I think you're supposed to look at it and the second turbo kicks in and the pressure drops slightly then goes back up it's supposed to give you a boost pattern I think of 10810 and obviously I can't see that right now see the rev counter just came back up that's working again but my oil pressure seems to be quite low I'm going check that out so dudes in some other news I'm picking up my R32 GTR tomorrow as most of you know it's been away it's been at the dip shop there were some issues with

(Start: 00:04:05)
the plastic dipping so they're busy fixing that now it's going to be ready tomorrow it's been 3 weeks that I haven't had the car or just over 3 weeks now that I've managed to get the RX7 in a condition that it's driving and able to break and everything's working beautifully I'm going to leave it for now and we're going to start with the project R32 GTR I'm going to start putting together my shopping list getting stuff in order so that I can start building it and doing that 600 horsepower spec I do have a couple videos that I've planned I've been planning on doing them for a very long time I'm going to get those out of the way this weekend and next week and then from there I'm going to start doing some of the mods DIY stuff and it's not going to be like the montages I've been showing on the RX7 it's going to be proper guys this is how you fit and install X Y and Z so we're going to do that let's talk a little bit about this RX7 I imported this car November last

(Start: 00:05:08)
year 2016 with the plan of keeping it as a project car building it making it better so a lot of you guys have been commenting saying get rid of that ugly as bide Wing sort out the exhaust it's a piece of why is it an automatic and I fully understand but a lot of you guys have also missed my talks and discussions where I've said I don't want to spend any money on this car I don't want to spend money this year on this car either so what I'm planning on doing is I'm just cleaning it up and getting it sorted out getting it past all these tests and I'm going to pretty much leave the car and enjoy it for the year that means no manual swap it's going to stay in its current water form for a while and I want to work on the on [Applause] GTR [Applause] [Music] no suit in TI baby I go to work don't do

hey what's up guys welcome to Nell Cal JDM vlogs this is the first time you guys are here this is a JDM channel I own an r32 GTR and this nonce 97 rx-7 fifty-three years I'm going to be doing project work on both cars if you guys interested hit the subscribe button hit the like button drop me a comment so in today's episode I'm going to be doing a couple things one of them is changing the battery battery on this cost completely did I'm assuming it did sell a charger that's dead after about an hour putting in a new battery I'm gonna be putting in a new radio into the car and just tidying up I've got a few bits and bobs that needs to go back into the car one of which being the glove compartment box there's also a few small bits so we need to just finish up the rear brakes as you can see the right-hand side of completely just here sort of left inside another thing I wanted to finish to Matt is the radiator plush I haven't done that yet I'm gonna flush the radiator and I'm also gonna change the radio declawed put some new

(Start: 00:01:00)
one in and the car should be hundred percent that means I would have changed all fluids in the engine side I haven't done diff and gearbox yet however I don't need that right now for this test that I'm trying to prep the car for so after two lot the car will be ready for this test there's also the HKS exhaust that I want to foot but obviously I don't have welding tools that I can use I'm gonna have to take it to somewhere so I'm hoping early next week I'll do an exhaust sound test with the exhaust that's currently on the car that piece of ship and then we'll do an exhaust sound test with the new HKS box and I'm more than likely going to be taking out that kept in the middle so let's hope the car sounds decent just a quick reminder you guys and I I don't have time to film right now until this car is done and registered on the road this is going to be another montage video you you

Title: RX7 FD gets some new upgrades
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw19yKQtCdA

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up girls everyone's well so i thought i'd give you a bit of an update on what's happening with the rx7 and a little bit of stuff is happening in my life right now so in terms of the rx7 we are almost complete with the brake side of things as you can see the hub assembly was taken off the rust it'll buff dad was all taken out as to the last year if you haven't checked it out it's a little montage video / together and it shows all the stuff they wear day to get rid of all the rust but most of it is gone actually mounted on justanswer that is gone from underneath and it's looking pretty damn good so what's outstanding now is we just need to slip on the new brake pad once those are on the entire braking system is complete the front 70 pairs the back of that knee pad it does have been skimmed they've been engineered I've been put on a lathe they perfect hundred percent now balance etc all the rust wouldn't taken off the car car is looking fun obviously it's not polished etc but we just hear

(Start: 00:01:00)
the pastas regularly test as for a lost discussion so here's another thing that I managed to do manage to get this room and clean it up quite a bit this is what I used to look like before so I haven't done the front rows years at all and this is how to come up now it's not a hundred percent off for a winter but it's something and it was just a quick little buff they're looking at a little bit or radius needed brunch the car is driving at the moment is absolutely nothing wrong with it in terms of drivability just the braking system was an issue and I've pretty much knew that I failed a test if there wasn't sources that that's going to be sorted up really soon now the wiring him does he redoing this is how it was before I want to get all these wires tidied up neatened up running through a lot places the old is kind of lying around everywhere was that  gauge with the guards put in I'm gonna retain it from the hard owner spend money on any gauge there's nothing only put up the Blitz racing to moze mechanical beasts gauge absolutely nothing wrong with it wats up

(Start: 00:02:01)
and priests temple diseases in vacuum I'm going to get a new to the whole deferred because this 1p the ship and get that operational again I most surely i'm going to mounts exactly but Marie doula wiring metal was crap now if you remember in the last video there was a doubled in front layer that was in here that the wiring that's all chopped up and it didn't look good at all and it wasn't working I've actually kissed that it doesn't get hot at all sets of blind unit have changed pieces of travel that stuff doesn't work now to resolve that issue I decided to buy a doubled in front layer of the jvc k WR 510 it's pretty much bottom of the range when it comes to double din so a couple features three different lots and like Paul fuller and leeches and also saw the  but you know what it's just that cover the hole and give me the vin sounding and robbery so that's one thing

(Start: 00:03:01)
I'll abortion so the second thing on a boat is an adventure for the talk of this battery pretty much just dazzle the time I put a battery gauge on there and a showing Queen's office in laughs i'll charge it within three 3 hours is completely dead is probably a dead cell on the battery itself not see short I'm getting any park made up to the sky because of that inside services and makeshift compartmental together but is running pretty sure there's a little bit of a leak there i'm selling it up putting a new element and pop in there and the third one is performance-related maybe not I don't know bentonite look at performance I hope they're can get to the exhaust here well you guys remember this piece of I get your cost that guy is coming off I'll manage the fund and HKS back box for next to nothing I'm not entirely sure that the

(Start: 00:04:02)
real HKS exhaust water it's a real HKS back box I haven't seen it yet I've seen pictures are both at second hand so if they're not going to really spend much money on this car in terms of performance mods i do want to clean it up and spend money in that regard but with regards to performance I don't to spend a lot so I found this exhaust second hand on the start that we called gumtree tonight's KSR exhaust or back box rather it looks like it could be an original one an old 1i haven't seen it yet it's actually arriving today it's coming from somewhere in Cape Town I picked it up for next to nothing either cross our pages ridiculous I'm hoping it is real thing if not it looks pretty good still operational throw it on the car and the person that's selling it knows nothing about cause it looks like it was some sort of second-hand dealer and including shipping I'm getting it for less than thirty dollars if I actually I have it by the time i'm editing this video and is an overlay on the screen right now because to me this

(Start: 00:05:04)
exhaust looks like it's like you told me maybe it's not maybe there's a multi short there's little tack welds over here the HKS logo is correct but I've never seen exhaust with the slogan pasa gets an old exhaust this is 110 low so that looks like a rat's arse this is an abortion so listed get modified it somewhere this is semi 6 model 3 inches look so much sure so I put a given a here no they will see the outside diameter and in this was 52 most scholars you headed on very small car much already have one then here there's some sort of a theme Vanessa I'm dying it's an original one but it's definitely better than what's on the x given and for the process of pipe I'm not complaining I'm going to throw it on the cost me extra nothing on two and it's a straight through pot tion a lot through this end and I could hear from here perfectly you can actually see on this side where this

(Start: 00:06:08)
piece goes up so either going to sound awesome if it was original and it was a little bit better looking I probably consider putting on the GTR but that's a car gonna spend money on I'm not sure what I'm going to go for one let's call you anyway back to me from the post you guys tell me what you think is it an original is it not it looks like someone's butchered the pop and put some sort of a 52 mo on the back way it's a place to be 76 mole 3-inch and hopefully the call us out a little better than that piece of that's on there right now the next thing is I'm going away for a little bit more often I need a little bit of vacation so we going to a place bull joburg or thank you guys might cause Johannesburg we going there for five days we've got a bunch of family there we've got a few friends there so we're just going to play a little visit see what's up take our baby there she

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] hey what's up guys I'm off to work on the RX7 we busy sorting out the rear brakes my father's been kind enough to start stripping the brakes for me I'm just been pretty busy with everything in life at the moment so he's given me a hand he's ripped the brakes off he's taken them through to his engineering shop he's put it on the lathe and he's skinned the discs I've got a set of brand new pads in the back and if you haven't noticed I'm on my head cam it's some Rob dry deck action cam of some sort I have no idea what the quality is like I literally just bought it I charged it and I've thrown it on my head so let's see what it does hopefully it's not that's as [ __ ] but I've got my dash cam over here that's recording

(Start: 00:01:00)
and there's a bunch of tools and a whole bunch of [ __ ] inside the Juke and we off to fix the RX7 I hope you guys don't mind bearing with me for the next let's say 3 weeks to maybe a month it's going to be boring videos in terms of getting the RX7 back back on the road like I mentioned I need to get this car Road worthy and there's a ton of Licensing stuff that needs to happen before I make this car a collector's item on our South African roads so just bear with me I'm going to be let's say 3 weeks to a month once that's done we'll get back to normal we'll start doing some crazy BDS we'll do some driving we'll do some random talking all [ __ ] cool fun vids like we used to at the moment di f fix in the brakes I'm not recording

(Start: 00:02:01)
every single thing we're doing it's not a full DIY video but you guys can see what I've been doing on the brakes Etc getting the car ride fixing the rust whatever it may be so I hope you enjoy it's going to be a montage video Let's Go [Music] [Applause] [Music] I I

(Start: 00:03:03)
[Music] I

(Start: 00:04:05)
[Music] I [Music] okay dude it's about 3 hours later since I last spoke to you and what we did was we took a drill and we had a little bit on it and that end had kind of like some little wires that came out of it um not exactly sure what it is and what it's called but we've ripped off a whole lot of rust on the car so tons all the rust

(Start: 00:05:06)
on the control arm everything we got underneath the car we started doing all of that we then had a compressor and we were bling all the dust away and then we filled the little bottle and connected to the compressor and that little bottle had Petrol in it and we sprayed the petrol just to clean everything and it came out quite nice after we painted a few bits so it could dry we started taking some rust off some of the units that were out of the car some pieces so calipers those sort of things and I can safely say that 80% of that rust that you saw in last video is all gone we've been painting everything in 2K black and obviously the Caliper Paint I'm using that dupy color red things are looking good I'm quite happy however we UNF finished there's a little bit more Machining that my father would like to do at his engineering shop he's going to bring the Dust back I don't have time tomorrow or the weekend so early next week I'm going I come back we're just going to fit everything put those new brake pads that are bought for the car

(Start: 00:06:09)
and go for a drive I need a bed in the brakes and just drive the damn car other than that everything's fine I'm quite happy there was a little bit more work that I did as well um I've pulled out the radio that big ugly radio is now out why it didn't work is because the harness for the radio it wasn't connected to anything it was just all chopped up and lying there quite strange though I think someone took the factory radio out when they were auctioning the car perhaps to sell it cuz the factory plugs are still intact and they're still there it looks like the car has never really had an aftermarket front loading radio and that's why that all that rubbish was in the boot you know the DVD player and all that other crap I think the front was always the stock standard one and someone put this piece of [ __ ] unit in the front there just to cover the hole that's my feeling cuz there's all the stock wiring in there I'm not 100% sure that's my my assumption so once I finished pulling out the radio while

(Start: 00:07:10)

what's up guys we are on the way to work on the RX7 we're doing a bit of brake work I need to get roadworthy done on this car so I'm going to be stripping out the brakes getting the discs off possibly putting new discs on or skimming if they're not in that bad condition and changing the pads so I'm going to take you guys with I've got a bunch of tools in the Juke I'm about to phone a mate yo G I'm down the road I'm Vlogging by the way you're in the Vlog okay go tell B by okay dudes gar on the way he's bring a buddy called Ben and I'm going to pH a mate to mine called Mark we going try to get as many hands on this as [Music] possible yo yo yo you want to work on the RX7 yeah 100%

(Start: 00:01:00)
okay you got 4 minutes man all right I'll be [Music] there okay guys we are here with the RX [Music] s this side is done the entire assembly has been taken out this looks like it can be salvaged so that's gone through to Engineers they're going to be putting it on a lathe and smoothing it out don't know exactly what they do but this is what we did we're going to be doing the other side now I'm going to be filming it I must apologize I haven't been filming this stuff because I'm trying to get this car rushed to Road worthy so I can start licensing and vlogging filming Etc editing it takes up a lot of time so

(Start: 00:02:01)
time that I can't spent on the car so I hope you guys understand I'll show you as we go [Music] [Music] [Music] the other thing that we're going to be doing today is an engine oil change I picked up a new filter today so there's the old one I'm hoping I got the right one I done a bit of research and it seems like the RX8 and rx73 b share the

(Start: 00:03:01)
same oil filter so when you pick up one of our local ones this is what if you what you would use on RX8 and hopefully on the RX7 I've got some licky Molly 20 w50 pretty good oil and then I've got some engine oil additive not sure if I'm going to use it just yet but apparently some lubrication pH that's good for your engine we also picked up a bunch of fusers and I'm going changing out all the fuses all the fuses on this car okay guys we're busy trying to get the oil F off so having a screwdriver through we going try get that out what we're a bit confused about is there's this PP here that was lying loose we have no idea what this is I haven't checked diagrams yet so it sits up here maybe Howard Tech or one of you guys can let me know this was connected on the end here it says 8 KS on it and it was sitting

(Start: 00:04:02)
down at the bottom tucked underneath I have no idea what this [Music] does four Engineers have to to put oil hey guys it's currently the following day I didn't get to do an outro in the video basically what happened yesterday is we we went to go and do the right hand side brake dust get that off get the hub off get that cleaned up take the rust off and it was a bit of a we had to use power bars all sorts of tools and we managed to get it off we then found an oil leak so remember I said the car had zero oil in it l because it was leaking from something so when I managed to get underneath the car under inspection the sum plug was finger tot actually loosened it without using any sockets any spanners I loosened it with

(Start: 00:05:03)
my fingers I'm pretty disgusted in this whole thing I decided to let the oil drain out the entire night so I left a little pan there oil's been draining it should be good now the oil filter was a bit of a  to get off we couldn't get it off by hand we couldn't get it off using an oil filter wrench was on enough space so we took a screwdriver we used the hammer got it in there that didn't work too well so we had to use some sort of a pop that we bent um used the hole that we pushed through the screwdriver used that put the pop and bent the pop and bashed it a couple times with the hammer and it was just so damn tight but we managed to pop it off now the next step is I just want to pick up a copper washer I'm going to pick one up today for the sun plug I'm going to do the oil change as soon as I can and like I said earlier I apologize for not filming the what's happening right now is I'm in a rush I'm trying to get the car licensed

(Start: 00:06:05)
because it isn't import we don't generally have these cars in South Africa they are registered as collectors items we have to go through hurdles of fire to get these things registered I don't want to screw this up so I'm trying to rush these jobs or actually that's probably the wrong word not rush I'm trying to focus on this job and not worry about filming every single piece and then we have to worry about editing later Etc so you you all know that I've got another life I'm a family man I've got a 3 Monon old baby and I need to focus on family and not just cars for now so I can't spend all my time on the car so I've got a few hours here and there where I go to the RX7 and I do work so I hope you guys understand once I start getting all this licensing paperwork thereafter I'm going to film I'll be doing DIY videos again on certain parts of the car So the plan is just to get the car Road worthy which entails making sure the braking system

(Start: 00:07:06)
is fine the cars had a service which is just oil oil filter unplug radiator fluid brake fluid just the basics just to get the car okay on the road and then I can start doing my licensing and paperwork thereafter we're going to start doing bigger stuff and I'll be doing DIY videos with the GTRs in the carryon it's head it's color change change it is however not finished it's going back next week for one more coat and it's a special coat so it's uh it is plasty Dub and I know you guys don't really like it but it's a specific one um I'm going to do an interview with the guys next week they going to explain to me exactly what it is it's I think it's called liquid armor pill something something it's it's got glitter in it and it's not exactly it well it's not mat it's definitely not met it it's really cool I'll show you guys a little sneak preview to pop up on the screen now little little clip of what it looks

(Start: 00:08:07)
like it's currently sitting at home with me now it's in the garage I'm going to take it back next week it looks damn cool and it's going to look even cooler when it's finished so guys I hope you're not pissed off with me I need to get this car licensed hope you understand these videos are going to be short for now next year things are going to go back to normal and I really appreciate your support thanks so much guys [Music]

(Start: 00:01:02)

(Start: 00:02:05)
I wash the exterior however the inside is Mankey that needs to be sorted out as soon as possible okay we pulled out the units from the boot that was no problem here's the wiring so we're going to start ripping out all this plastic pull all this out so that we can start pulling out the wire which leads into the front somewhere it's full of Cubes right front of the car we found this okay so there's a TV that was sitting at the top there's the bracket for the TV and guys apologies I'm filming off my cell phone again so this unit in the front this is actually a Panasonic unit it is possibly the amplifier for the rest of the stuff bunch of wires in here again it's a Rat's Nest I'm going to start pulling this out we're going to do that right now Okay so we've made quite a bit of progress on the car we've pulled out the standard boost gauge that was up

(Start: 00:03:05)
there there's still those annoying holes in the top that we need to get sorted out but for the most part the gauge is out they've epoxy the gauge to the holder which is really I was trying to break it off but I'm going to have to try and heat it get it off somehow it's one of those old school ones so it uses vacuum and then here's the wiring I'm not going to change it just yet this this car I'm just cleaning up I'm not going to spend too much money on it as I am spending money on the GTR back of the car fuel pump cover is Rusty that's going to come off that needs to clean up I've taken a couple of the nuts off so I'm going to replace those see there's a bit of rust on that gu I'm going to remove those get them replaced clean up take off the rust Hammer right Etc here has a bunch of that came out of the car so I don't know what everything is yet that's an amplifier I showed you guys this is that DVD car navigation system

(Start: 00:01:01)
and the car's not so bad you can see here there's quite a bit of gr and stuff that's not coming off the wheels there was some silver door Sills that said RX7 on them they were pretty scuffed I've pulled those off so I started sanding them off at home started polishing them and they're looking a lot better guys thanks so much again for the support I really appreciate it we've had about 40 subscribers roughly join us this weekend so welcome to you dudes this is ncal GTR Vlogs I may possibly change the name in the future to JDM Vlogs see as I love all JDM Cars at least most of them I have an RX7 now I've got a Juke and I've got a GTR perhaps in the near future I'll have an S15 and maybe something else so we'll see how that goes but for the most part we're doing project R32 GTR and we're doing project RX7 f3s so those are the two that we're going to be consider in as project cars my juke is just my daily

Title: Picking up my Mazda RX7 FD3S!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDjUIFPY15I

(Start: 00:00:00)
morning guys so I'm currently on the way to my father's place he's going to be driving his truck we're going to pick up a trailer I'm going to be driving the Juke and we're going to be driving to port and we're going to pick up the RX7 so today's Wednesday the 7th it's a bit late I know I said to you guys the 5ifth we're picking it up I was hoping to the ship was in our waters on the 5th on the 6th it went to Durban port at 1: in the morning they started offloading there I had a friend that went down early morning and he went and had a hug and he said he saw some car is getting offloaded I couldn't personally go but cars were offloaded I know the cars offloaded in the morning of yesterday the 6th and the car is ready for collection now so we've made a booking time now we booked for this time period we're going to pick up the trailer we're going to pitch the car and that's that guys so I'm going to Vlog the entire process I'm nervous um obviously this is a car bought in auction I haven't seen it I'm pretty sure there's quite a few things

(Start: 00:01:00)
wrong with the car but I'm excited at the same time it's a car that I wanted for a very long time and today's the day guys it's finally here it's been 2 and 1/2 months that I've been talking to you guys showing you pictures showing you videos of the car and it's not with me so today is the day okay we are officially on the way to fetch the trailer now in front of me is my father in his truck he's going to be Towing the RX7 we brought a couple planks we not sure how tall the car is if it's going to make it into the trailer without scraping the front like like I said earlier I don't know anything about this car uh looks like it's got stock suspension in the auction sheet and the auction photos and all the other photos I've received but I don't know so we're bringing planks with we bringing all sorts of straps tires whatever we can think of Jumper tables The Works just to make sure this

(Start: 00:02:02)
car gets going and we've got some tools and hopefully everything will be fun So the plan is now we're going to drive we pick up the trailer we then have got to go to some place in town and pick up a vest for myself because we completely forgot that we cannot enter the port without a reflective vest and my father's got one I don't have one anymore so we're on the way to pick one up after the trailer from there we're going to go into do the Customs paperwork um for the car everything is pretty much ready we just need to sign sign some sort of a delivery note and from there we're just going to go and pick up the car so it looks like we're going to go into the car terminal so I'm hoping to Vlog this if that's the case there should be some JDM goodness there these will be cars that'll be going through to Zimbabwe Tanzania Botswana Etc the suu these

(Start: 00:03:02)
perhaps could be Supras carons we don't know hopefully we can see it so guys join me on this journey it is exciting OB nervous at the same time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it looks like we're going some sort of back road to fatch this trailer uh actually didn't communicate with my father as to which trailer higher place we're going to I kind of just let him organize that um since he's driving [Music]

(Start: 00:17:20)
be on the road so guys it needs a bit of work as you can see and now it's just like man you got to have that time you just like disconnect from I've just jumped back and saw the juk cuz uh you're not allowed filming around here so I'm getting a couple dirty looks from people I did forget to mention to you dudes that the intercoler pop in the engine bay is completely broken so I'm I'm going to have to get that sorted out first before we do [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:18:20)
anything yeah [Music] yeah yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] C [Music]

(Start: 00:20:45)
[Music] h [Music] you a [Music]

(Start: 00:22:00)
through with aoud allow it mares from beneath the sound take me seem [Applause] so across this universe she lives another the Reas she [Music] okay guys as you can see I've got the car here it took about half an hour to get it up the driveway uh we had to get it off the ramp we parked in a bus stop I had to jumped the car we put some fuel in we managed to start it all is okay however that boost pop I'll show you guys in the sick is broken it's brittle and it's not fitting properly so I was trying to drive up the driveway it's quite Steep and I battle to get up but we yeah so I'll do a walk around of the

(Start: 00:23:00)
car for you guys another time I'll show you exactly what's wrong and we'll go from there and I'll tell you guys my plans okay here's the engine bay so it's not too bad for what it is and the price that I paid there's the two intakes HKS mushrooms 63 M same as what I got on GTR uh these look a bit toasted I need to replace the filters on them for the most part I mean all these pops just need to be cleaned up now here's what I was a bit irritated with this intercooler PP was broken around round about over there so it wasn't clipping on this was completely loose the guys are driving around with it open here so car isn't getting any boost wasn't making much power I barely got it up the driveway so I just took this little coupler that I had off the GTR um kind of shoe horned it on top here with piece of cut can cuz same inside diameter slotted it in put some pressure

(Start: 00:24:02)
on there and put another one there and it seems to be okay CU so obviously this is very much temperary I need to change that pretty soon I know what I'm going to do cuz I can't get spars here so I'm thinking and maybe if there's any RX7 guys that are watching I'm thinking just get a 90° Bend silicon 90° Bend put it over there and then put a piece of aluminium popping or stainless steel pop the same diameter coming up and then obviously another bend over here I think that could do the job um otherwise I going to import the part you guys tell me what you think I need to redo all these hose clamps any pretty much any clamp um anything you see here I need to clean up I want to clean up the top of the intake manifold this is a blitz stf that's on the car I've actually got a Speare

(Start: 00:25:02)
one and I think it's only connected to the one turbo far as I know it's connected to the bottom one and then I think that's the other dump valve the recirculating [Music] 12 I may be mistaken I don't know much about this car so for the most part I mean it's just it's dirty it just needs a clean up I've driven it up and down the driveway um haven't been on the road yet cuz I don't have any permits to drive just yet next week I'll get that sorted out otherwise the car feels good I was a bit pissed off yesterday about one thing the car was bone dry with engine oil there was absolutely no engine oil in at all I checked the dipstick um dead dead dead it was nothing um so I went like I said I went out and bought a bunch of 500 Ms topped it up um still the same filter cuz I just wanted to get the car running last night and yeah it's it seems to be okay it's

(Start: 00:26:06)
rearing up fine it's driving up and down the driveway okay um but I don't want to chance driving it on the road even next week without doing a proper service so I am going to get things done there's the oil filter over there I'm going to get that swapped out change the oil change the sun plug change the filter try to get some HK replacement filters and then see what the car does in its current form I can see there's a hole up there as well so that that's pretty simple to replace I can just get a new piece made up couple bolts around here that are Rusty I need to just change out for the most part the car is not so bad clean up these bolts clean up the rust keep on the inside I want to redo the radiator fluid and just do all my checks make sure everything's okay but guys um it's

(Start: 00:27:08)
a project car so I'm going to be getting this going nicely brakes are a little bit of a up you can see they Tad Rusty um calipers are looking bit where where the rims definitely need a refurb so I'm going to be doing that I'll probably do it myself I did the rims on my silica stripped them down painted them white and with some dupli color hard paint and you know it look pretty cool I'm thinking and you dudes tell me what do you think about obviously cleaning the car up getting everything looking nice black wheels putting tint on the front and the back window so pretty much just blackened the whole car out you guys tell me what you think I'm not sure if you guys can see

(Start: 00:28:10)
this but there's this tinge of blue on on the boot I was a bit worried that um it was sunburnt or something was wrong with it it's actually just seems to be like some fuel or or oil that's on top of the the car so I've been managed I managed to wipe it off so so it just needs a good wash hey guys uh this is day two of owning the RX7 I just quickly nipped off to my parents' place cuz there's been a few hail warnings as you can see outside it's pretty gloomy so I just came came here so I just came here to move the car and the cover don't have any of my cameras with me so I'm filming off my cell phone so sorry for the quality so just show you guys quickly what is wrong with the inside of the car the seats are okay except for the one that I'm sitting on it's got a cigarette burn on it there's some big remotes here for DVD players and all sorts of crap so that needs to come out

(Start: 00:29:13)
there's this dodgy CD player and mini dis player there's those cup holders everyone hates this one's broken this is going to come out there's a Panasonic 6 and 1/2 in TV that needs to come out that is an electronic toll collection system this one here I need to Google I have no idea what it is there's another little Panasonic unit not sure what that is there's another Panasonic unit over there there's a microphone over here it's a Panasonic microphone the boost gauge is pretty stuffed or at least actually the gauge is not bad it's the holder the hole is too big so someone's glued it on here they also drilled holes into the dash which I'm not happy about you can see the cluster is not working too well rev counter is not functioning it comes on and off every now and again it

(Start: 00:30:13)
comes on so let me give it a [Applause] more so that's what the car sounds like currently radio is not working glove compartment box there's some heavy exhaust rattle sunroof functions everything else works in the car automatic windows see It'll goes up and down on its own doors working this is loose but it works electric windows work pretty much everything works the air conditioning is working only thing that doesn't work the

(Start: 00:31:13)
after market stuff so the radios Etc automatic is still working obviously you guys know that I'm going to be redoing this there's going to be a manual gearbox coming in other than that everything's fun inter in the back is neat I'm Going to Pop the trunk pop the boot show you guys okay there's still gas in the springs so that's that's a good one uh in here that cover fits over there there's a glove in here and some really rusty lug nuts but the tools are still there which is nice so you close that up in here I was taking a look as well tools are there that's the cover for that and then there's some funny Aerials here these are Panasonic Aerials see they extend out it's like some sort of a TV area and there's another one over

(Start: 00:32:14)
there uh this I just brought along I'm going to be running octane booster in the car nothing nothing crazy some 20w 50 it's a long story but I'll do a proper walk around with you guys this car had no engine oil in it yesterday so I bought in the evening a whole bunch of these little 500 miles I filled it up and it's happy now Panasonic DVD car navigation system and some ad zest six disc changer that is definitely coming out you can see it's been here for a while the brackets are even rusted so pretty much all these electronics that you see that's not supposed to be in the car those are going to definitely definitely come out here's a dodgy exhaust let see how big the box is on the exhaust it's

(Start: 00:33:16)
terrible okay guys anyway um this weekend I'm not able to work on the car so I will get to it as soon as I can I'm going to wash the car I'm going to clean it up I think we're probably going to start with the electronics reped all the unnecessary Electronics on the inside clean up the interior clean up the boot and get the car sck and span again guys thanks for watching appreciate it don't forget to like comment and most of all subscribe if you already have thanks so much guys well see you next time yes a [Music]

(Start: 00:01:01)

(Start: 00:02:02)
semester or exhibit as the top RS the starting price will this vehicle was four thousand two hundred eighty six dollars if they installed for twelve thousand seven hundred and sixty two dollars its 2001 model is got 80,000 kilometers plus minus fifty three years it's white in color if our transmission means that it's a manual car for there's the grading of the car and our means has been rebuilt in some way if the grading is a number it means that the car has not been an accident will not have costs replaced etc so forward a really good a brand new car would be a five something like a mint condition or 34 GTO or be a four-and-a-half so for is pretty denominator go through and just open up a bunch of tabs here as they will start clicking through and looking at her so this is a Baathist edition it's all four four eight and it's choose one or two Jesus there's an if see here that's all four six hundred and ten dollars I've got to open up another FD for for two and I'm just gonna pick a random one I'll take us about halfway through the month of September light will be halfway through

(Start: 00:03:02)
the month of October and is the yellowness over twenty thousand twenty seven thousand dollars and so forth holy  this was cheap two thousand two hundred dollars for this or x7 okay I think we got enough here let's start from the first one this particular white - of a1 model 80,000 KS are conventions here and here's your auction sheet though this auction sheets got a couple of things here's the model of the vehicle okay here's the grading that inspecting it goes about now these two I get a little bit confused about one of them is in Tier one of them is exterior I think the first one is exterior so you've got gradings a is a brand new car really really good because all the way up to e which means it's pretty much this one's go up City 1633 KS or 80,000 closest male transmission it's the automatic it's got aircon let's got power steering power windows automatic windscreen wipers it's got a bag and it's got ABS brakes this is your VIN number or chassis number for the vehicle and these little guys here I mean few certain things so a 2 means if it's a

(Start: 00:04:03)
scratch it's a decently sized scratch there's a scratch or crack on windscreen X X means that the body panel here so it'll be this door has been replaced be I think be was a dent so we'll have to just go back here and take a look sorry B is a defect so there's a defect over here a one small scratch you one is a dent okay five on the tires might be wrong on this but the grading on the tires I think they've got up to 10 so 5 means it's got 50% laugh on each tire this sort of stuff you gotta get your buyer to decode so I've got someone in Japan who's helping me out they read this auction sheet and they'll tell me I care well it's got problems with the suspension or wine or water and it's got a HKS exhaust whatever they might put on those buying sheets you got to get the guys to decode and you might not get some honest people out this just be very careful so that's the call one will go through there's a lot quicker this was just to show you did whoa okay so this guy's got quite a few modifications some sort of saipan top speed but not too short could be re

(Start: 00:05:04)
anemia and i lost lost wheels in the corners front bumper huge spoiler big Wang gang must be exhaust is it a decent diffuse on the back I love these JDM number players they're really cool interior he's missing the radius and weird builder gearshift knob the carpet mat looks like someone blade alpha not some up cables here looks like it's missing that panel it's like some sort of a piece of plastic here maybe wrong I'm actually keep us one open and compare interior from another car these gauges look at the Dodge I'll probably remove those that looks like a teratoma I think the seat has been removed and setting up the front seat in the car can you tell but it looks like the seats been removed from the clock anyway so this was caught being worried for me it's gonna hundred and eight thousand K's BB and it's an R so that's been rebuilt it somewhere so that those car let's me what's the next one who this kind of looks like mon-sol for $4,800 and it's got all those so stuff here blah blah you guys can pause and read this thing if you want pretty decent looks cool most exhaust no these

(Start: 00:06:07)
wheels without spaces just doesn't do justice to the car looks like they're too far and I'm particular like it moving on let's come back to the FC okay here's another interior pixel it compared it was let's go there okay see it's definitely out and this is plastic but over there so you can see this called Mustang seats missing a plastic but I guess I back to those cars all 4200 it's got a couple of issues it's the three so nothing's been rebuilt in the car bonnet looks like cheap buzz sod fenders look a bit cheap interior looks pretty good though oh and lock and all that is some sort of a push start button no I think that's where your cigarette lighter is seek I don't know the Oryx even two arms the way Montserrat from Japan dear wat one's crap silver one sold for 2257 dollars this is absolutely money now something is seriously wrong with this car I don't know what possibly a blind engine now the reason why I say this is there's an accelerating X over

(Start: 00:07:09)
here and they've crossed all of that  out so don't exactly sure what's wrong with a Costco hundred seven thousand K's on it it looks really neat it's a manual transmission which is cool lots of unnecessary wise lying around and it's got some sort of LTS a top lots on the back I don't know what you call them cooling looks like it needs some work the chronic oil is cheap that's in running condition is few and far between sir two thousand dollars I think is cost right twenty-seven thousand dollars for this mess they are excited it's a great for to be be the Scott is pristine there's a couple little on it's a small scratch small scratch W is paint that needs to be repaired or was repaired and slightly visible and a little scratch there and then there's a decently saw scratch there so full of most part this caused pretty awesome it's got 64,000 cares on that stock wheels those stock wheels on their stock front bump first up weighing as far as a my exhaust is the dual exhaust said the best car is pretty damn stuck that's

(Start: 00:08:10)
quite nice those car looks like it's been looked after quite a while once you're sure it's getting a little there but it's still a hell of a lot of money for this far that's a lot of money rut was FC 610 dollars for this thing toilets rough figure what's wrong with this car and watch sulphur so cheap and forget the auction sheet first stuffs been scratched up and crossed us my feel is engine is blank I don't know what that means if any of y'all speak Japanese let me know in the comments I'd love to hear whether so it's all for next to nothing why looks look at the front ok bonus not lined up maybe soft rice properly it's got lots of paint sort of nice little dent on the side day unless they paint looks like some rust spots in the front hmm back of the car looks looks like a holy  what's going on here so this is some sort of an HKS ECU from the 80s it seems this thing's huge it looks like some sort of a gaming console from the mid 80s there's some unnecessary wire lying it's missing the plastic this old-school knobs there for your air-conditioning I

(Start: 00:09:11)
don't know if it had encouraged you back then fan it's a cool hot this is properly old-school and it so let's put it off the market steering wheel nut the seats collection of good gangbanged in the car wow I've gotta close this I'm sorry too much okay guys it's fun to more auric Stevens and we'll move on for this let's go to last week so 22nd of October I guess I found to this one stall for $3,700 again I don't know what's wrong with it there's a big stamp on it and not too many details its bonus not lined up the flats on land up with front bumpers not lined up it looks like needs to respray looks like it's sitting at some crash junkyard to be honest look at the cause in the back I don't know what is going on here but does not look good back of the car looks great our wheels could reduce some changing in tear of the car looks pretty neat that looks like a knotty steering wheel some sort of a six disc CD changer or just to double them didn't CD changer and what that is cell phone holder perhaps for

(Start: 00:10:12)
the most part the interior is neat you know look I don't know pull the mountain asking money they're asking and for not knowing what's actually going on I don't think it's worth it at all let's move on right $3,900 pretty cheap it's a grade three hasn't been in the massive accident or has net parts replaced and it's a PP interior and exterior hit lots of like they've been replaced and it looks like primer coating doesn't look like it's been painted most big exhaust that looks like a HKS power perhaps again the quality without wheels faces or maybe bigger wheels interior looks good is a gauge there's no the gauge the top it's missing the gearshift oh yeah knob it looks like it's missing a little button on top of the handbrake as well so spark a steering wheel yeah maybe for the money it's actually not tibialis actually stop that so yeah it's got defi something so I'm assuming it's the diff you gauges could raise wheels and it's got broad something doesn't look like broad feet unless the seat here is a broad bucket seat akhantar and

(Start: 00:11:15)
yeah look it's definitely a broad seating so you yeah beep are and there's a little dude here that come into the car let's go look at some Kyoto sleepers ok so again you're gonna select all the days of the auction and you're going to select the maker I guess oh really selected one month and we're gonna be looking at tiaras and supers we're gonna be looking at - you're asleep Erzberg guess a bear in mind don't know too much about the supers I know my cool cars equal to JZ j2e for the patrasche model and to jay-z GE as far as the life of the normally aspirated but by 3 liter inland sixes the turbo models a twin turbo the both rear wheel drive and they're both crazy cool cause however they have been banned for import in South Africa but Yodas Africa put a ban in place in 2014 and say that it was hurting our market particularly on the Toyota 86 sales so they stopped importation or further implications of TR super so I will never be able to own one unless I bar a local one okay again

(Start: 00:12:16)
I'm going to pick up some random cars yes so yellow on this red one plus one for $13,000 I'm not gonna go for mark three so we have a particular look at mark 48 Oh skipper take the cigar and $21,000 I see the ones got a dental never this one look and it's going to current month and pick some random ones here what the $48,000 for that one I gotta see her and as a pink super $3,500 yeah that's a full supras so first one you guys know the drill auction sheet okay so this particular one is the chair of super s is Ed I think that if Sid is the normally aspirated model let's take a quick look for euros super okay so this particular one sold for $3,200 not a lot of money it's got a hell of a lot of mileage there 206 thousand kilometers the power steering it's got power windows it's a 3.5 hasn't been in an accident it's got be interior be exterior pretty good I've got a couple of small minor issues this is a if said model so that means that it's a normally I spread to jay-z ge

(Start: 00:13:18)
it's got some rare share this can be fixed you know what that is math you've some sort of a sticker it's got a nice exhaust in the back we are Chitti and break is to be changed steering wheels ship I hate the stock actually I hate the stock wheel on the GTR r32 and on the super short the stock will look like an rx-7 but the most part of those - you're pretty ship okay yeah boring moving on ed one red ones Daphne but sprayed deadly okay so this this red is from a different car all I could even be Plasti Dip some that's been sprayed over there's some sun damage lots of sun damage over there doesn't say with us and he said or ours that are living the model my B's so that I can tell you it's Kakinada exhaust brought the grade 2 which is probably one of the worst gratings I've seen in online looking at cars and auctions he means the body is  and the interiors I mean you can just see it's got key I don't even know if the P is P something there's no P here so this legend doesn't

(Start: 00:14:20)
show you what the hell appears there are lots of damage on the back of this car that actually lots of damage everywhere on this car stay away never sold the car well done here's what the car you this for $13,000 our Z s model this is the legend 3 litre inline-six twin-turbo rear wheel drive looking at the core to be I don't know what could be the B for the exterior 3 and 1/2 grams pretty good a couple little problems on here now this scares me I have no idea what it says I would get a bias to tell me first his exclamation marks they big exclamation marks and I'll see that I don't want the to expect $15,000 for this car class the dude hiding inside there I would put some wheel spaces on there these bigger wheels house exhaust that looks like a a pixie a VCR I think some crazy gauges everywhere lots of wiring our thumbs a little bit better that looks like an a pixie is say if see this dude looks like

(Start: 00:15:22)
he's touching himself moving on okay grey CP is Z are think this is I don't know someone tell me in the description I think this is the twin turbo beast it's got a six-speed manual gearbox I don't know ask about well be the turbo model maybe not COO Cara $21,000 this is a throw money what's in the box speed meter a full scale okay some sort of gauge their standing wheel that's like decent standard wheel so this must be a later model it's telling one so they've got a little bit more since in the later years and the wheels looked a lot better to know what that's about super they're part super next one silver who is the one of the dent it's lots of scratches there why is it scratched up something's broke and that scratch that it's said okay before someone obviously popped the engine on the way it's sitting at USS Osaka so it's one of the

(Start: 00:16:23)
auction houses don't know what that means and let's see you know it's big dents in the backs and scuff marks and massage that's missing the wing as well anyway a lot of money for a car 48,000 buckin dollars for this thing 4.5 grade this car is near new it's got 17,000 kilometers on it six thousand two hundred eighty one it's a B or round there's two little scratches on the car and something wrong with the windscreen other than that that's crazy stock wheels on the car s Z are this is definitely the turbine model that could be a teritama teritama maybe this controller I'm leaning more towards the turret armor that was a shitload of money for this particular car you could buy a good couple of scotland's for us and we left with this pink Supra it's a rebuilder to see you around possibly a couple issues here and there CPU this is

(Start: 00:17:24)
probably a normally aspirated model 2500 next to nothing some issues there dent and scratch possibly this car looks I just had a bad spray job it's an auto model that's what's cheap what our sterols and some random cover nuns probably underneath and my cup of tea in the wheels of dodgy at this pink what were you thinking musta been a chick driver okay guys moving on now we're gonna look at some Scotland's yes sir this pisses me off and if you guys from Japan part not listening by any chance a strong fix this you can only select Scala you can't select you t is t GTR etc etc say koala boy you'll see now 2400 of them will pop up and now anyway first a differentiate whether it's a GTR or GT is T is here and there's no filter thread either so I know those of the GTR there's gtst so I understand a random D I've got a couple unless you got to come

(Start: 00:18:27)
up with B is obviously of these pics so I'm gonna open up some of these as well 33 look at those 83 pages worth of scotland's it's actually put nails looking through all of us but I'm gonna do it anyway for your dudes so I girls I've just kept a whole bunch of pages now and I'm still looking for GTRs I'm betting to find them we've got good couple pages open now so let's let's thought of us so here's the 32 it's sold for $1,200 it's got 74,000 caves and that's pretty decent I've no idea what any of this means I'm not gonna run through any of

(Start: 00:19:29)
that you guys know what's going on now these pictures are really small and really shitty so let's let's skip this car next one still 149,000 KS it's an art III just like mine sold for $11,000 so I put it up small small pictures so the N 1 front loop so the in one hit Lots let's got that little in one loop see if I can make this bigger quality shuts the N one lap in one head laughs looks just buck mark are missing that little back back left obvious order for mana something's been rebuilt to see grade for both interior/exterior gtst someone drifted this bad we're on the corner or it could be bonnet lift us upon its paces I don't know anyway I'm jumpin to confusions here so gtst it's got some pretty shitty wheels on it some ish there's got a gauge and it's got a damaged bumper little peewee exhaust and some funny stick on the back I don't know what that's about

(Start: 00:20:31)
that looks like a check and some dude pushing your head down and the heat shooting stuff at its GTR holy drift handbrake what the is those differently to me this handbrake looks like it's touching the you're feeling that is awesome cringe but awesome ok yeah this was this was some sort of a drift car and I think it didn't end badly he rear seats have been pulled out and sorry like I was that bad hand brake just killed me out I'm moving up now goodbye r33 GTR the victory spec so this would be a V spec one something's been rebuilt BB good car for the most part looks quite neat sold for $11,000 must exhaust looks like it's pushed a bit too far back there some

(Start: 00:21:34)
sort of entertainment system here I guess this electronic toll collection system spark our wheels frozen I pretty close of the news my gauges that's my the mismo plus turn is my gauges etc cool car another r33 you know the v-spec beast makes actually really common in the 33 $8,000 it's all for looks likes got a couple of shoes that's got Steph Navin up it's got some horrible wiring that would need to be cleaned up someone left his cellphone and they're moving on 32 GTO are missing a wing rebuild so from what I heard was ours rebuild AE means it's been rebuilt really well so if you look here you can see that there's hardly anything wrong with the car look be interior and exterior mostly in the wing now it's got some gauges and that militia no 33 bit himself negotiate sold so sorry it did sell but out of the auction for some reason 38,000 KS or

(Start: 00:22:37)
whatever ok another 32 not solved so they started to one it went up to 6 F for $8.00 doesn't sell the seller pull the car out of the auction just before or what the meters reserved the name in one front bumper or some strange bonnet I would not put that on my car comes with the dead inside missing gear knob that that looks a bit poked some funny theory will and it's got 56 thousand kilometers of fun that hard to believe due to the condition I've got $84,000 think and monza a lot better condition let's go another one 33 v-spec very common v-spec omar cup of tea especially with this wooden piece of and the last one there's a $38,000 rebuild our ii don't know what that i was CEO around

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up girls so today I've got a little bit of unexpected garage tom it's a Sunday afternoon my wife's got some family over so they looking after the baby doing baby things and I've got the afternoon to myself so I don't always too much time on editing videoing cetera mounting cameras moving around filming and I really want to do it for you guys but I'm lacking time these days and it just takes up a lot of my time so what I'm going to do is I'm going to work on the car and then I'm going to show you what I'm going to be doing and I'm just going to show you the end result so I humbly apologize for this but you know what I saved me like two three hours and I'd rather use that time to spend it on the car I'm sure you guys will understand okay so some of the stuff I plan on doing is just getting all these little clamps standardized I've got all sorts

(Start: 00:01:02)
of different clamps everywhere I need to sort all that [ __ ] out I need to clean up all the grime there's a lot of oil on these houses on the silicon hoses in the back of the vacuum houses etc and I just need a little bit more to clean up over here sir dee greets clean up etc I'll show you guys the end result apologies for the lighting the next thing is there's a bunch of wires that are hanging around the back here that I just need to sort out so remember I said this was kind of neglected this was a battery relocation project and really bother doing the interior just showed you guys the boot and the engine back I ran out of time so I'm going to be sorting that out now hopefully so on the boot in Lacombe busy sorting off the wiring as you can see there's a few loose wires I need to just reroute those speaker wires they just need to come out there's a couple of things I need to just tidy up in the back of the car so today's just more of a tidy up

(Start: 00:02:03)
here's a bit of ground that I'm not happy with just when I saw all the [ __ ] up and I'll show you guys the end results in a sec I'm hoping you guys can see little bad lighting but I need to sort out all the wiring so there used to be a water tip gauge it was sitting over here and the wiring is no loose I'm going to pull apart the - I'm going to tidy up cable tie everything you can try to display those keeps falling off so I'm gonna put some velcro strapping just like let's go and I'm just gonna carry on and do it all tidy up on the car I also want to leave my harness I've got a say belt five-point harness that I want to move to the passenger's seat and hopefully I'll get it to cut I wonder for the seat now so as you can see this is turning out to be quite a bit of a bollock there was a lot of unnecessary wires SuperBot going up and down the road while I'm trying to make this video

(Start: 00:03:06)
anyway came back so there's been a lot of unnecessary why is that I found in here there's been a lot of [ __ ] I'm trying to clean up I've gotten rid of quite a bit of stuff already and I figured you know what let me just change up something so remember I had that boost gauge over there somewhere so I've seen some other girls death pull up you sketch out this is the event that Canton sits over there inside the dashboard and I'm gonna take my dremel and I'm gonna cut it out and get this to fit so I think you can do it with the 52 more gage which is what I've got and I'm gonna primarily focus on the interior of the car and just get this all neat and up and there

(Start: 00:04:13)
you have it gas one day's worth of cleanup actually turned out to be another modification so I'm pretty happy with the whole thing and I came out it's mounted to a little ventus it's sort of adjustable if you see that I can move it up down right left so it's pretty simple to do I mean I just took the dremel cut the original piece out and everything's done I've also tie it up in an atheist so there's no loose wires everything's nice and neat and I've got a lot more space to work with so girl story for the short video and sorry for not showing you everything but like I said not easier to work this way say cars thanks a lot and obviously see you in the week for another video

that's the GTR and this video was if she's supposed to be a drive and talk video but it was a firstly I've set up my dashcam in the car I was poking out busy driving and battery died and plan ahead and charge it and then mixed I took this camera set up some suction mount and flying good twice good eye for inside I just went straight to the carwash didn't talk and I film it on my selfie and that was so I got the GTR what I want to do is just these small mods for now then something I want to talk to you guys about and maybe you can give me a little bit of advice and I'm gonna put it into the poll here so just select one of the two options whatever you guys think is best so I need to do something about this paint work it may not look rather it may

(Start: 00:03:04)
look good on camera but it does have imperfections now I don't know if you can see here but there's these small imperfections on the top of the car on the beach in rather on the wing the wings are a bit of damage your stores close but according to share you on that side but there's anyway there's a little bit of damage so I want to tell you guys what I've ordered not with two things one is the N one left that's supposed to be on the front chair and you can see if this hole already there it did have it a flew off a couple days off product off from Japan and it's supposed to have an n1 lip on the beach here so I've ordered those parts you can see is a little grommet hole thingy for that little bit lip so what are those two parts that are gonna be arriving soon I'm going to slap them back on and that'll make the quality a lot better so

(Start: 00:04:05)
I want to know what you guys think about either getting the quarry spread in its current color which is Spock silver so fixing fixing ship like that that's one there's some on the side they already get you these as well spots on the roof obviously the n1 stuff will need to be repaid it's coming carbon fiber according to get to it but underneath the car there's a bit of damage a little bit over there so either get the car fixed and respray it lastly there's some more issues or get the car plastic tubs in base side blue now there's a company I can do it from a lot of money they can get the cosplay plastic duct rather in base side blue with a gloss finish now processing is good I'm thinking either do that with

(Start: 00:05:07)
a Fuji movie wing on the back or and it's a lot more expensive get the Corey spread so what those chiaki let me know what you guys think I'm leaning more towards the wild side getting a car plastic depth mask Bayside blue get that fujimori wing on the back here very pretty cool if I get that on so it's either sparks over with the in one kit base I'll glue the in one kit and put you move a ring right other than that next year plans for the car mantra show a meaning yet but more than likely twin Garrett 2860 there's fobs I essentially want to build of 600 650 horsepower GTR I'm not possible I can do the stock engine left to God's ballot so I'm gonna take yours in little Jenny the next thing is barn exhibit where is it so I've been betting other guys in Japan there were a couple of minor issues that we're sorting out for

(Start: 00:06:08)
the most part things are done I'm just waiting for my import paperwork or other import permits from something called I tech in South Africa I should have it but it's if there's a Friday and that's not going to stop anything for now the car is ready to go and shop we have a shipment booked for the 26th of October and the call will land here on the 28th and the bid but whether or not I can connect that collected from port on the 28th of November I'm not sure depending on where the car is in the ship might take a little while longer get out but either way it's landing here in South Africa on the 28th of November so one weird thing was 26th of October well if you guys remember but the date that I got my import license was actually done even Rimbaud that will pay enough but it was the same date in 2013 that I got my import license then the

(Start: 00:07:09)
date that I won the cause the 21st of September 2013 was this GTR 21st of September 2016 was the date than a1 Marek 7 this car got shipped on the 26th of October 2013 exactly three years later I'm shipping another vehicle that is weird expected in Japan he said that the his raising his arms they were superstitious they don't believe in coincidences dodgy said I don't know let me go let me know what you guys think I like pretty cool Mouse coincidence maybe I should play those numbers in the lottery anyway guys that'sthat's what's happening project et Ossa to continue I've been a bit slack because of the newborn babies trying to spin Tom bonding getting it into a routine etc so it's been a bit quiet I've been doing these little videos with Madonna and flames and blah blah blah so just bear with me for a little bit I'm

(Start: 00:08:10)
gonna get back into this and we're gonna alternate the probability project GTR one week I'm gonna swap the cars obviously account for that yeah I'm gonna be keeping the Oryx even at my parents plays and they're not far away from me so every now and again I'm gonna go and swap cars but the GTR they're bringing rx-7 he had the project or exhibit work and car the following weeks what but things etc etc you get the point because that's what I'm doing so hit me up on this pulse let me now just think through the baseline please text it up or get the car sorted out and sparks over fix up all the and get the call back to what it used to look like so guys that's it for me if you need to channel thanks so much for watching if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button it would be really cool because if you really subscriber thank you so so much I really appreciate it we almost in 400 subscribers that's freaking awesome unexpected to have but 200 by the end of the year so 400 girls

hey guys thanks for joining me today so i'm going to show you three things today and the three things are my new york 7 which is still sitting in japan i did a video conference with the guys and they showed me the course i'm going to show you a couple snippets of it at the second thing I'm going to show you some of my old cars that I used to own and third thing is an early birthday present that is received let's go so this video was done by the by in Japan I've slipped a couple parts out of it because it was quite long it was almost 25 minutes and I had a very cringy face on then I was smiling the whole time and looked awkward sir but to me over myself there and I've cut some of the audio because I was just too happy to see my car and made some strange noises so here we go I'll talk you through the video as we go icg Fiona my school-yard very good I

(Start: 00:01:12)
guess I this says the by showing me the car in Japan you just showed me that it's got 17-inch BBS wheels on the car is just showing me the sides of it obviously facetime the quality wasn't very good he's outdoors he's using mobile network I was at home wireless anyway the car looks pretty decent from the outside everything that I saw on the auction photos is on the call I was more than happy with everything that I saw and it got stuck suspension we confirmed that it's got the Dutch exhaust on the back which you will see in a couple minutes stock bumpers paint is decent he says that the car looks very good pain to it does need to be changed just the wing on the back needs to be resprayed and there's a couple of defects but we'll see how that it is when it comes to South Africa these should be going into the interior of the car in a couple seconds ok so here's the interior you just pause it here for you guys well crazy can work okay solar stock

(Start: 00:02:15)
steering wheel there's a bloody scheduler they're causing the sunroof there's those dodgy cup holders there's a TV and he's about to top the corner yeah it's got that I could slow back I just wanna see it so guys I just want to talk to you about this exhaust and I some of you thought that it was an REM me Mia exhaust I'm not too sure because I think there was an implement on the re amemiya however i'm not sure what this is this could potentially be the emblem the quality is way too bad for me to see however I'm not too familiar with these funny marks on here so if you guys know let me know but i think the aria me Mia is very expensive anyway here's the exhaust oh

(Start: 00:03:24)
ok can you do it on a blitz your dad 30 knows ok others rights are okay yeah multiplies so you kind of locked himself in the car something happened it was obviously a problem of the door mechanism that I need to fix my so that's it guys it looks really good in my opinion it looks stock they were some photos that I can't seem to find any more and then even

(Start: 00:04:26)
really looks change that there's a blitz dump valve on the side and then obviously these two HKS filters which is the same one that I go to my GTR currently all in all I'm really happy with this purchase and the car should be here middle of November okay guys now if you seen my rx7 I'm going to show you a couple of old cars that I used to own my bear in mind i wasn't a youtuber back in the day it didn't take a camera around with me and take many photos the photos that i did the quantity is up to [ __ ] so i'm just going to quickly run through it also lost the hard drive or to say i've lost a lot of photos i'm not going to show you my daily drivers because they were quite boring and i'm just going to show you some of the turbocharged cars that I've in the past like sea breeze etc I went none of them I've good fighters of a couple of them here so here's one about a crashed WRX top are a this is how it got them and they were two of them one was 98 WRX or GT turbo

(Start: 00:05:27)
is what they call it in our country and that's your age a 22 litre the WRX top or a was pretty much the same as the Africans baked example is JD in and they were around to fixing it so I decided to put the car out hidden rd steering wheel and pretty much everything else to come to the top are a standard and not sold pretty much everything so I don't have any photos of the car then I heard that 98 that you just saw as scarce kept on winning the bigs aust the little bit of work I don't remember what two guys running on the car theme may have been a VF 43 or 35 I don't remember what work I did but HKC bc i had defi gauges and that's the car had some little vent enough to add the stock wheels on so a decent car don't last too long I'll think I had it for about two years and then I parts of it off at the

(Start: 00:06:28)
front mount intercooler don't know what intake that was this my HKS solenoid all in all it was a cool car then I had a 19 on GT turbo or a WRX somebody you may know it now this was a really cool car built this cough attract and also i was going to introduce he like show competitions etc because i had done some really cool choice monster so here's the car trying to get onto trailer and head coil overs it had a strike 2.2 litre block and i don't remember what else was down to the car now with big injectors it was a GT 2860 well i think it was a disc repete tur anyway there was there was a decent sauce turbo on the carbon fiber boot wing HKS hi-power exhaust as far as i remember decent in tukwila that's when i picked the car up and

(Start: 00:07:33)
that's also going to pick the carpet still the stock brakes lad had those bridgestone potenza re o 55 ish tires on which I got another new said afterwards and stuck it on as road going tires I exactly legal so this habitable 0 sports deflect the thing on it HKS ebc solenoid front mount intercooler that's the car there in the garage now I'll do some interesting stuff to the car to the 6 speed swap on it and then there was a default in remember which stuff went on the car rainbows went on rear and front brembo the rear as far as i remember i had to make up some brackets for it to fit but i did get a guy some hitters the car is pretty decently built here's a picture of the call on the rain there's a brain bears

(Start: 00:08:33)
in the front now that wagon was my daily driver that I bought and there's my little racecar I can see inside I had str seats in there I did a full str swap on this car from a whole car from a 2007 hoka there was one that was crashed and i bought pretty much everything from roof floor seats the rear seats the carpet the cluster peck and this is what i did i stripped out the whole front end of the car I cut back some stuff on the inside here doesn't quite remember what I did i rewired the entire cluster pack and I got it working on the car so that was you there we go let's go back there so that's at the semi complete answered the 6 p-10 and I got the Gator and I got literally everything in from 2007's Tia it took I think I was about five six

(Start: 00:09:36)
weekend's worth of work and I got everything working not a single problem on the car of the Steelers no dccd and the scam of the Interior came from a 2007 HTR the 6-speed box was from a I 30 I for so there was a non DC CD version I had deafies almost quite as well HK CBC and it was pretty cool now this car I didn't keep for very long I believe the mitre twice a break to gearboxes a break at deaf I don't quite remember it was quite a while ago and but this column lost long I'll ended up seeing it to Jeremy to get fixed and drags about what Johannesburg is about 600 kilometers from where I love said it sent it up on the trailer had it fixed up in Johannesburg and are then sent it to a tuner in Joburg he then called me so the box just blew up on him

(Start: 00:10:38)
and then I think I've sold the car up in Johannesburg it then come back down so yeah kind of mr. Scott did look quite cool okay next is 2002 WRX wagon this is how bought the car stock wheels very boring and then started doing some work in the car some friends found out that this cause making badly and it turns out that the previous owner had used cardboard boxes as head gaskets he had cut through cereal boxes and he made set of head gaskets and the call lasted right about 300 kilometers before sort of smoking and it just went for [ __ ] so we pulled apart hadn't made the rebuilt and a little bit of work on the car kakumei exhaust through coilovers on eventually I think they're rbcs that I had on they said garrett turbo I think

(Start: 00:11:41)
it was a disco potato GT 28 something GG 28 RS i'm not mistaken um yeah it's a little str thing he's on their whole bunch of mud a 3 brain browse on the car so the scar actually landed up being modeled daily driver or rather weekend call ahead we had four surgeries at the same time it was the GT turbo that raced call one that I showed you just now it was this call and there was something else i think i had the top ra and my life three estia but i had four at the same time I quad remember I haven't had a single in four years now writer came out after that and rebuild 2.2 striker work went into and that's kind of what they ended up looking like after a little bit coral lasted about five

(Start: 00:12:43)
hundred kilometers off the full rebuild had attuned took a friend out from the joyride and might have popped begin bearing wind I think a rod went through the block as well I sold the car immediately the next week I spoke to my wife and we decided okay we're just going to get the GTR and put the money down and bought the r32 GTR that I've currently got now and I've never looked back so that's my wagon then I had this car this was an i5 WRX so I had a boot on there from a 2007 str i did a beat swap of someone the day that i bought the car now this was a bad luck car I own this car for about eight hours I had the gospel subaru dealership delivered to my house it was near parker door from the garage and the next morning we had a

(Start: 00:13:46)
break-in and someone came into the house they broke into the garage they couldn't find anything to steal in the car sorry let me backtrack a bit they smashed the window of the car but before doing so they try to pry open the sunroof there was a WRX premium so you can see there's a sunroof from the top there now the college parkland those get out here in the back and there's some windows on the sadia and they were trying to get into the house so they stood on top of the car that's got on the bonnet that into the side and they crowbarred the inside glove compartment box they couldn't they didn't figure out to open it I don't know how and why but the glove compartment box on the side so they use the crowbar and they rip it open they also damage the seats I don't quite remember how much damage it was and there was about 150,000 Rams plus-minus they had to replace seeds dash and how much panel work bit of a respray the sunroof was broken

(Start: 00:14:46)
in your currency or at least us it's about twelve thousand dollars worth of damage and they kicked the side of the car they've been to exhaust a bus standing on it the wing was cracked it was terrific I hadn't even driven the car I was told not to drive the car because insurance that I kick in the following day that day in the morning early hours of the morning for the morning sir guys came in the broken and they did all that [ __ ] to the car so quite upsetting so the car went from there and it went through two panel beaters and it took about a month before they've sort of the car out in the interior Rob that fixed up the called nasty and I then find Fred and I said hey guys I got my car back I want to show you what it looks like and that's what happened I left home 200 meters after the but after I left the house I hit a pile of rocks in the road I was

(Start: 00:15:48)
opening my sunroof at the same time that I hit them so kind of lost control this was the second cibrian owned and probably in the first one I'll tell you the story on that one see but all in all driving observer child cause probably about 10 hours with and I landed up going down the bank and rip the car to pieces and yeah just sad story so I'm caused off the right again when I got it back under the whole bunch of mods and went from there so my first ever see Bree was a 2000 GT turbo and it had issues i bought a secondhand in 2003 i think or 2004 know what yeah 2004 say that car was a problem call every time he accelerated their issues couldn't get over 120 kilometers an hour rebecca fire of splatter etc back then on you absolutely nothing about cause then work

(Start: 00:16:50)
on cars couldn't give a continental so sense the dealership the next day that I got it and they try to diagnose issue they said was fixed got it back slow wasn't fixed sent back again stayed for about a month they couldn't fix the sensitive to another dealership they couldn't fix it then they refunded me my money and that's when i blended buying that new five st r and sometime after that and then erected from there I had an 03 str I had a couple GT turbos or WR X's and then I went and I got myself thus carlos sainz limited edition silica then he made five thousand was the number 29 30 it was a cool car it had foiled rabbit and four-wheel steering it had turbocharged that had a water water cooled intercooler or some call it a charge cooter so it was very tatis I

(Start: 00:17:51)
pulled it apart and iris braided and it's kind of all it look like off to it it has the engine bay there's the stock turbo quite a big girl not sure exactly what's on there and that I sorted out and all looks good I put on this little side cover parody of some heating issues of the ABS and duct clean up thus and anyway the car came out really well it let's now sold on Anna's Carney more i kinda regret not keep entry because it was a collector's Arthur but either way I cause gone and I've got my or thirty TGT our next step is obviously my cheek is another type of chart car let me show you guys this is a jig that i bought from a wife and this is my second jig we brand and the center plus before then this came up then he made a hundred of these cars they called midnight Edition and it's 1.6 to buy it's 140 kilowatts I

(Start: 00:18:53)
think that's about 190 horsepower plus minus matt map here on i'm just thinking of the top of my head fun little car to drive then my fringe car this was my first ever call that was the biggest piece of [ __ ] it was a mission elmira and it stayed standard for about a month and then I started getting into the car sound game and all that crap and you know you're 18 years old you spending whatever money you got on car are literally put shipped into this car I had a playstation 2 in the car I had a DVD player on yeah that was shocking this was also the DVD player and I put some cheap racing seats in the car some dodgy Mets steering wheel stock I changed this piece of [ __ ] get up I had not just oxide in the car I

(Start: 00:19:53)
was running the standard 1600 meter they came with el maraa with night scene nothing done to it as in exhaust which was a straight pop 63 Mel back then and I was running nitrous and I would literally top up those nachos once a week and I had some sort of like a foot pedal price thing that every time I accelerated costs eighty percent the nitrous to kick in as long as the bottle is kind of open and I used to use it pretty much every weekend just driving around town and I had this huge to comment on the top flip I had stickers galore it was a real shocker these are the only photos I have of the car unfortunately no work done to the brakes never been to the suspension I had dodgy Dunlop is p7000 DS on the car it was a shocker and I used to think I was cool until around 21 in a soul some Gaza Subarus one day and I kind of had a race

(Start: 00:20:55)
against them i think i was running a downer the car and I got something like a hundred and one kilowatt with mattress and I don't remember how many shot of nitrous oh there was a 50 or 75 shot but I lost really badly to a stock WRX the thing was 98 or 99 and then I decided I ki need up my game mustard labor cause and that's where I am today so these are a couple of the causative in the past the asylum are cool some of them went unfortunately no photos of every other car that I've earned here and my three his tail is very cool back home seem to find any pictures of that so it's pretty much it on the old car Saab so let's move to the garage i want to show you guys something God's so I officially have the coolest wife around I just got surprised now with a little bit of an early birthday present she figured she'd give me something now while still it home with baby and still enjoying my

(Start: 00:01:03)
earring is getting well I did this I did the battery relocation side of things just tidying it up on the interior I showed you guys in the last video I didn't complete that and then also in the boot just tidying things up so just doing a couple things in the boot and just making sure sauce and secure I'm just putting some spaces you can really see sorry about the lack of locked but I'm all just puttin some rubber pieces and it's also the battery doesn't move and then just holding the battery down and tidying up a couple of things then I decided let me just take the car out drive around the block and then pocket and here's where I up hello darkness my old friend I kind of misjudged the wall in my garage donno what I was thinking clearly too tired I shouldn't have been working in the car and the front ends all scratched and

(Start: 00:02:06)
here's what it looks like on video I do have a camera in the garage doesn't look like much but it took off that much meat so I'm just a little bit pissed off you know always had this thing and I said to myself don't ever work on the car will drive the car when you're tired when you drunk under the influence of anything and emotions etc and I kind of messed up and I started working on the car when I was tired I shouldn't have done that I've drove the car when I was tired just drove it around the block but nothing else and that's what happens in my own home anyway it's not a big deal I just thought I shared with you guys I kind of got over making this movie about putting the radiator hoses in say here's what it's looking like i'll show you guys the end product we're not finished but cars coming coming along slowly and tomorrow I get to see the rx7 on video we I'm doing that Skype conference call with the Gaza Japan partner going to show me

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up girls so we're all here for the same thing and that is to find out what vehicle are just imported from Japan it's currently sitting in Gifu at the moment it's been delayed by typhoons it's on its way to Nagoya today it should be there tomorrow as soon as I've got it I'm gonna stop my licensing and paperwork etc getting a permit so that I can import the car into South Africa once I've got all of that sorted the car gets on a ship in a chemistry yeah so Lobby has been gear saying what it is some of you have been rats some of you been well off but for the most part you guys knew what I once it was rear-wheel drive turbocharged car this is actually a 20-word car no it's not here to see bro so it leaves us with a 1997 Mazda rx-7 53 is that's what is on its way now this car is something that I've been wanting for very long time it's an iconic Japanese sports car this particular one was not

(Start: 00:01:01)
my first choice this was I think the 25th or 26th car on the auction that we're playing and I've been losing everything and I've decided to change my mindset so I was looking for a very particular corn it was a car that had less than 70,000 kilometers very little scratches or dents and perhaps had a little bit of work done to it and for my price range I was pretty much losing everything not bad a lot but I was pretty much losing everything now for something like that looking anywhere between $10,000 and 20,000 US dollars so it's a lot of money to spend on the car and that's prior to import duties to your your Tech's and as everything else that you looking at to get the car to your country of origin that's the price at the bidding house now I've decided to change what I was looking for and we decided okay that's good and look for a car that has sloppy higher mileage perhaps an automatic

(Start: 00:02:03)
and then dents and scratches stuff that we can fix so without further ado did the drumroll this is a Turing X version now this particular version of the car came with a sunroof standard it came with cruise control the cam with climate control unfortunately it's an automatic it's a 4-speed automatic that can be changed quite easily like boxes and not expensive I could probably do the swap myself often either it's cool : or this particular one has been 139 thousand kilometers it's got standard steering wheel standard suspension standard sunroof standard seats it looks good it looks like someone respectable maybe some sort of a businessman here in the car you can race the car is a turbo timer on there which is last to know that he was the pianist of the car there's a boost gauge that we skaters

(Start: 00:03:03)
put in hardly now if you look on the interior side this Netaji cup holder these cup holders will go very quickly there's a big TV some looks like a 10-inch DVD - thing and that's coming out of the car I'm gonna clean up the wiring of the boost gauge of the bumps and stuff so the plans for this particular vehicle is get a chair enjoy the car mark estimate is this less than 50 on the road in Africa that actually registered on the road The Wrestler here from foreign countries have been used for drift and other types of events I'm going to be registering this car much like a registered much easier as a collector's item now this car is going to be a separate project the GTR the GTR is more track-focused weekend warrior it's a beast on its own I've got a lot of work that still going into the car but no means I'm gonna be stopping project GT thus GTRs gonna stay with that seat stripped out the boots stripped down etc

Title: Nissan Skyline Push vs Pull Type Clutch?? Update and Future Plans
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gJyJ0MPWAs

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys welcome to your project or 32 GTR so in this episode I'm just going to show you guys how to determine whether you have a push or a pull top clutch on your 32 or 33 or 34 models there okay I'm with pull top clutches I have got a pull-tab clutch as well now initially I thought it was a push pop however after day a little bit inspection it turns out the pull top clutch so I have a bit of a change of plans in terms of my clutch I'm gonna be doing and I'm just going to show you guys how to determine so one thing is from February 93 onwards they started releasing the r32 gt-r with full top clutches - an April 93 should have been warning bells for me already but I'm just going to show you guys exactly how to do it and figure out what you've got in your car so let's take a look okay guys this is the underneath of the column on the driver's side what you see where the lot is shining over there that

(Start: 00:01:01)
is your clutch cable that is your slave cylinder and those two little bolt holes over there that's falling after that's the bolt holes for a pull top slave cylinder there's two bolt holes over there that aren't in use that's where your push top so your push top would bolt on that side and your cylinder will be facing to the left mine is bolted on the left and it'll and it's facing to the right hand side all on the lift would be a pink top the one that ought to be a push top and that's it that's how you can distinguish between the two from there you can go on and order your clutches receive the pull top of the r32 GTR is the same as the same clutch as what the r33 uses however you cannot use it ought to be for clutch on these vehicles so simple as that how to tell whether you have a push or pull top clutch cuz I just want to talk to you about about an update and what's happening first thing is we are having a little girl and she's gonna be born next week

(Start: 00:02:03)
Friday so she's coming early she's coming up just under 37 weeks so she's a bit of a miracle baby we'll get into it another time obviously I can't be working on the car during the time when she comes home from the hospital for probably a few couple weeks after that that's what started doing those buying JDM cause of mahon videos etc so just a couple of gap fillers yeah you guys enjoy them they seem to be taking okay obviously I've got quite a bit of stuff to do on the coastal so I'm gonna get to it but it's just trying to calm down a little bit for now so as he goes a scene we've done a hell of a little work in space on two months I mean the channels that you've been around for about two months plus bonus and it's been a good two months I've been getting pretty cool reception from you guys communication is awesome really enjoyed hearing from you dudes you know for me to put myself out there but the car out there get these videos out it's

(Start: 00:03:07)
it's a lot of hours for what you're getting better again to me it's not about the YouTube money which non-existent at the moment it's not about any other nerds it's about documenting my time with this call it's about making new friends I've made some pretty cool friends ever the communication between Olivia guards discussions debates etc it's been really really cool and I appreciate all of that I'm gonna carry on as long as I can and I just wanted to say thank you guys for the support it has really meant a lot to me because I'm going to show you a couple things now what are we gonna try and achieve would be for babies here I might even do some of the stuff while she split hospital I'm gonna have Tom I'm gonna be bored my wife's gonna be in a hospital there's nothing to be able to do so I'll try and catch up on a few things so I'm just going to show you guys quickly what we're gonna be doing and what are we gonna try and achieve before babies here take a look at Gary Dixon GTRs the link in description will

(Start: 00:04:07)
be rush yeah he's got a page rate those GTR related content little bit of JDM stuff discussions tests reviews etc is pretty cool similar to my channel take a look I'm sure you guys will enjoy it okay so the first thing I'm gonna be doing is obviously cleaning the car I've enabled keynotes since the race day I've been a little bit busy with laughs doing other little core projects so car is filthy by the way if you ever noticed I've got my gorilla tripod I'm using it right now found it again one thing I'm gonna be redoing is the battery relocation if you guys haven't checked it out check out my video the link will be right here in the description both of the box down I forgot to put the competence I'm gonna unbolt it I'm gonna cut the carpet it's it's a pretty shitty carpet so I may get a new one and just throw that on obviously I'm leaving the whole cost stripped out because I barely drive it and I'm gonna be trekking the car and dragging the car hopefully next

(Start: 00:05:08)
year sometime if you haven't checked it out this is what the relocation looks like afterwards I want to tidy up that red cable yeah I ran out of Tom so I pulled a little bit of a sneaky and I didn't show that a mile don't show in the video I didn't clean up the red cable in the interior I still need to get a fuse and put one on that side and then I just need to tuck away all this why so I leave quite a bit of slack and that's gonna get hidden away so I need to just finish that off core needs a clean underneath the dashboard there's a couple of wires that need to be pulled out from that old oil I think it was a royal team kit that I had or what attempt kit we need to fit the Easter I have fit said anyone soldered that guy that's in however I need to put the other five or six pieces I need to figure out where the old guy couple of those but I'll take you guys along for the rod we can do it together that should be about it for now

Title: Buying JDM Cars Online : Episode 3 - NEW vs OLD
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3UHZbQ4KyA

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey guys welcome to buying JDM cause
this is episode 3 and we're going to be looking at new versus old cars so the
basic format of this is going to be cause that are relatively stop and talk
about stock the stock wheels going to be talking about tunability on each one pros cons and essentially what i like
about them so this is my point of view don't get offended by what i say it's
purely what I like so let's get straight into this 300zx twin turbo vs unison
350z honestly like both of these cars they're both great cars if I have to
choose one of probably go for 350 said for couple reasons are personally think
it's been looking once you start throwing some arrow mods on bail
sidekicks different wing the car does the quite appealing i like it looks
awesome for me it's got a big break it's got rainbow stocking up front and rear
is called calipers and I love girl swap

(Start: 00:01:02)
them out or bigger units eight parts
accenture but having the car come without that's the big advantage you can
just step them peace instead of cross drove a lot of tasks perhaps in DC pads
and your a4a way I mean you can track the car that gets set up my brother porque with 306 horsepower that's the
flywheel it was decently lot was 1 5 45 kilograms just over 1.5 times calling
Crimea its its aggressive in its own way and it's got all the bells and whistles
in the interior I like a car going back to and looking at the 300zx twin turbo
those car was a heavy be thousand 654 kilograms so 1.6 times roughly turned 76
brake horsepower g2 that gentleman's agreement back in the day it's a NASCAR
min it's got their 3d 220 motors press the feet easy with 3.5 v6 normally
aspirated look of someone have to give

(Start: 00:02:04)
me the 300zx I didn't say anything we'll take the car and I probably took
on the things and who knows maybe I enjoyed I've never driven one I had a
350 lead for a week I have a soft spot for that's probably
one eating more towards it however if you look at the back of the
300 exits find a bit boxy not my first choice goes my opinion I'm gonna have to get the wind to the
350z did even know what you guys think about those the rx7 versus the RX now
this one's a bit of a no-brainer for me the rx7 has always won hands down its
better looking at water it's got a twin turbo motor benefits can be rotary as
opposed to the normally aspirated my58 advice 1.3 liter and thereby three-wheel
Drive however are excited it's got played archers go to leopard to me it
took around its to commercialize the rx7 has got a Thomas body of copán tastic
looking watches the front bumpers

(Start: 00:03:10)
awesome the rear of the cars really cool
once you've got that that wing on the back or even an aria media kept on the
car or any sort of wing on the back to be honest it looks hard I love the part when looking car
twin-turbo mitre nothing beats the sound of a charged 13b might start weaving
between TBH that nothing of mad once you stopped charging these majors they look
freaking awesome they sound freaking awesome to look the
rx7 having an overall win to me it's a no brainer came up just under 13 tons
thousand turn 80 kilos however the rx-8 came in at just under
14 sorry 1.4 times 1384 kilograms you don't know what I'm going to say I'm
gonna say RX ever gonna get to work for me so I would go for an older car with
species even eight and nine versus the evo 10 now I've never had either

(Start: 00:04:10)
had a lot of surgeries in the past I've
always wanted and either i'm still get an even if i could for me i would
personally get a Tommy Makinson edition or curd made one of the later models
like a nifty 360 or 400 there be pretty cool i prepare the evo 8 9 i find that
the car a lot more aggressive then you attend upon an even 10 rear end is not
cool I don't like a natural water market it
just doesn't appeal to me looks too much of a family car top so sorry
distinguished as a cool JDM sports call some sort of race car in a normal
posture by 10 vehicle and they'll be like we're connected to the mitsubishi
or whatever it might be and so for me I would say that you ate mine it's got a
lot more graceful the salmon looks way better at my eyes one big thing about
having an evil a two month later she has a lot of parts with the older generation
so they've got the 4g63 mytouch that you

(Start: 00:05:15)
need the tuber think it runs into your 5
20 g or something around there so it's very easy to replace the Pharaoh to
become a car to get speers originally available now if you have to have a
problem your 10 it's gonna be big many aspects of court least from what
research i've done i've seen of a lot more expensive having the other models
you know for me I would have to say it would be either a 29 going back to it
that you are ten i think it's 25 it'll be a last quarter is daily but if you
want to get looks from people what people say oh well what caused that
that's cool talk about quarter of Engineers got the 2-liter turbo it's a
full be 11 t mitre along with elements a more upon version of the 4g 63 motive
but it's just peeling off for me so it's not devil Anse on guys with me i would
say the even eight or nine hands down done and dusted that's the
carefully okay so I'm saving the best

(Start: 00:06:15)
for last you guys the map is the iron and a 32g
are not 23 model and possibly going to be a little bit biased towards this one
so we're going to go for the older generations will be the offi to 33 and
34 versus the or 30s excuse long biased opinion but this together all the models
based so so the r32 GTR that has got a hell of a lot of racing . to join you
just need to do a quick Google search before and all the stuff out there it
was banned from park that before the banded 12 pins I mean that was the first Japanese
calling history to win anything major it was in nickname Godzilla they
consider the supercar back in the day a lot of you now say working all the GTRs
not really a supercar compared to a chronic cig or a block ever give this
ship it was 9 pounds supercar back in the day because it trumped everything
out there and name the gods of the firm's Godzilla be the king of all BTR
mad i'm digressing get back into it and

(Start: 00:07:22)
see how exhausted i get about this car
racing heritage that's one thing that's a job as call it was really cool car to
drive it makes anyone feel like a superhero when you drop the car it's you
it's the car there's nothing else in between there's
a little bit of a product here and there there's a taste the system is that hot
cat systems the tester is your control for the your talk shifting from front to
back the hot cast is your rear wheel steering so this will correct your talk
and push up to the front wheels on the back wheels when it picks up slippage
etc and your heart cast is obviously your rear wheels how they turn when you
are engaging into the corner so it does turn in both directions and it
turned on opposite ends in the same so most cases me taking a corner it's going
to try and induce oversteer so if you take your heart of corner that the
wheels in some cases will start facing

(Start: 00:08:23)
to the right hand side side back of your
car starts looking out eating some understeer there which is great and the
girls don't know about oversteer and understeer let me know i'm going to tell
about but those are the basics on the r32 obviously the 33 and 34 had super
high caste said with the electronic system as a price to mechanical one that
I've got a mind the system was also a lot more responsive that's the right
words that better technology better computer etc on the later models 33
thing for the old ones are also featured in manga series i'm a big fan of initial
B and Wang gang did not you guys haven't checked it out really cool most of the stuff of subtitles so you're
not into that sort of thing that maybe give a skip but let's say we're going
but not for example again to motor back but cool cars and there's rx7 supers
this utr these guys pull the cars and

(Start: 00:09:26)
the run of the freeway there's the one particular crime that's
the devil z and this car has got some mystery behind i'm not making any
spoilers but it's mostly centered around this vehicle and the driver of the
vehicle there's a lot of cool cars of us short of stuff that they're talk linger
to speak about East tuning and doing this exhaust that injured blah blah blah and that's pretty cool to
see some guys doing now it's also very detailed and artwork so very last check
out our cars much lighter spying on 32 the early editions Cameron 14 13
kilograms and went up to the forger 1540 not talking special editions at for
those who wait for the stock model versus the or 35 35 is quite heavy and
Cameron at one point seven tons or 1740 kilograms nothing else the car has an
absolute monster 3.8 liter v8 twin turbo

(Start: 00:10:26)
this call highly tuneable I mean this is
ms elphick it's there you're the only ones with the p800 switch something that
came out a couple months off to the car was released then and was really pushing
the car date and horsepower now we're seeing thousand six hundred thousand
eight hundred two thousand plus plus plus the cause of absolutely cheating
playground guys are loving it 202 203 achill insane vs cause my
authority we're going to between six to basic
computer inline-6 twin-turbocharged straight-six amigos may call it it's an
unbelievable later when it comes to sound however like they say no
replacement for displacement I'm a die-hard fan always stick with the RV 36
it's a cool night mercy on 35 it's an amazing car looks awesome to the
costs insane when you start breaking clutches and gearbox you go to worry
about other things that go with it and

(Start: 00:11:28)
electronics and because just full full full of
Technology nothing against the car it is beast however I still love the other model
purely because they have so much history behind them they are chronic Japanese
super cause the guy's hands down for me darlin deplete a 3g 4g are of course
we're not talking about tsps GT etc ttys gas-x very much for watching hope you
enjoy this absurd forget to lock comment subscribe free shuttle to use your
comments and appreciate you guys thank you very much if there's anything you

Title: How to import a Nissan Skyline R32 GTR from Japan (With all paperwork)
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVy-iGJAVKQ

(Start: 00:00:00)
every day there's at least 15 to 25 r32s coming through the system it's crazy stuff there's rx-7 there's supers this honda nsx's you name it they've got it it's there for sale tells you when it's being sold um what the starting bid price in how much it's sold for the grading etc etc now we're going to look at actual paperwork on my vehicle and how i import it and how i brought it up what's up guys so today we're going to talk about importing a nissan skyline gtr into the country so this video is specific to south africa although some laws may be similar i'm not sure how they work in the united states or the uk or anywhere out of south africa for the matter however if you are wanting to import one of these vehicles or any other japanese sports car you can follow these guards now if

(Start: 00:01:01)
you're based in the united states northern america i've partnered up with a company called rb motoring they will assist in bringing in your dream vehicle from japan they do have vehicles and stock in the inventory i've dropped a link in my description and at the end of the video you can check them out for what we're going to discuss those particulars africa so let's get started on this so the first thing obviously is finding the car and buying the car um now the car may be in in japan or another country so we're going to particularly look at japan and a couple ways to buy the corsa one most common people get a trade car review and they'll find their cost of this particular 91 is 10 500 11 600 are shipping to durban south africa which is where i live and this is through a dealer so someone has bought this car they have the car in their lot or their warehouse

(Start: 00:02:02)
and they want to sell this vehicle so that's one way of doing it so you can approach these guys you can see what they've got in stock and bar from there then there's auction houses so i see this is an auction house i've never been to this is japan used cars there were no skylines in here but i saw sylvia is 15. and i'm guessing that you can put a bit down and buy the car from there i awk.co.jp this is where my car came from now this works with all the auction houses and all the lots that are in japan kobe tokyo etc it looks at all of the lots and it pulls one big inventory and you can select cars specifically by grade of vehicle interior exterior model make engine size you can filter all those guys out and do your purchases now i unfortunately don't have access to

(Start: 00:03:03)
this anymore my logins expired but you can sign up and set it up most of it as you see is in japanese you can use google translate and get most most of the stuff out when you click on an english version you'll come to a sign-in page you sign in here and i'd say about 80 of it is in english it's quite easy to work through you'll see thousands and thousands of cool vehicles going through every day there's at least 15 to 25 r32s coming through the system it's crazy stuff there's rx-7 there's supers this honda nsx's you name it they've got it it's there for sale tells you when it's being sold and what the starting bid price in how much it's sold for the grading etc etc now we're going to look at actual paperwork on my vehicle and how i import it and how i brought it in so i'm going to show you how to import this vehicle so once you've found your vehicle we are going to bring it into the country following these specific set of

(Start: 00:04:05)
rules let's take this guy for example r33 gtr i know you cannot bring this in the united states but this is twelve and a half thousand dollars okay so our laws in south africa works on engine capacity in terms of the money that you'd have to pay to start so we get some sort of a vat amount that we've got to pay um which or rather a tax amount and that tax would be based on engine size so i think it's 1600 3 liter motors you'll be paying 25 so fortunately we fall under that bracket we pay 25 percent of the value of the vehicle this is twelve and a half thousand dollars so it's roughly three thousand dollars that we have to pay in tax okay on top of that you have to pay 14 vet now that is standard in south africa so essentially looking at paying 39 to the value of the vehicle okay once that's done you're going to be looking at a couple things so let's let's get the real paperwork out

(Start: 00:05:06)
and show you so guys this is my actual auction sheet from the purchase of my vehicle so obviously i have emitted a couple items here so it's personal to me i didn't want to show any of this so skyline could pay b and r32 the rest of the numbers are your chassis numbers lot number blow that out gtr it's a 93 2.6 liter 79 000 kilometers f5 is my gearbox now all the gearboxes start with f5 for the 5 speed ra that condition means it's a rebuild and it was a minor rebuild so the back of the car had a small thing it has been fixed it was fixed in japan and it's actually done pretty well however the respray wasn't so great the exterior grade is a b and a c for the interior now b is a really good exterior grade a is obviously a brand new car b it's close to that so the car's got hid headlights on here it shows the gt-r bnr series it's got power steering power windows now these little things

(Start: 00:06:07)
here that means that there's a scratch on the car scratch or dent that means it's a small dent and it's generally the size smaller up to a golf ball so up to the size of a golf ball um luckily i didn't have any of those they were tiny tiny little dents i'm not even sure how the guys picked it up those are scratches light scratches and that's a little bit of damage on the back um so that is your sheet now these are the photos that you get when you're looking at the auction house and this is all you get to see now i'm guessing that they marked my interior down to the grade c because one my leather boot was damaged i've replaced that the leather boot over here for the handbrake was damaged i've replaced that there were wires hanging all over the place and i've tucked those away and everything's nice and neat now p1 buddy club rooms so that's all that i got to see on the car these details here generally show you that there's some sort of a modification it shows that there's hid headlights and in here if you get this translated you'll see that

(Start: 00:07:09)
they might have written it's an hks intercooler etc i did get this translated however i cannot find the sheet um it did mention a couple mods i didn't know there were coilovers in the car and there were a few small choice things that i would have loved to have known before the car arrived but regardless i got a surprise so guys moving on let's go straight into it so the first thing that you need to do is you need to obviously get compliant with a company called attack now that's your international trade association they will allow you to buy the car now before doing so you need to get registered with the import export so you need to get a license so you can just go down to their website over here import export license let's see here today fill in your name your id number the date where you're from your physical address numbers etc sign and then obviously you get the stamp by commissioner of oath at the police station or anywhere else

(Start: 00:08:10)
next another declaration format you need to fill in now this is your general power attorney and let's of consent so this is just to state that you got permissioned and that you're entitled to apply for an import and export license with customs so we've got something called size in the country it's yours african revenue service and that's customs as well obviously they will need to make sure that you qualify to get this particular license so you've got to send through these details along with this you are going to send through a letter stamped by commissioner of oath to state that you are joe blog you live at this address and that you reside here and that you if that you are purchasing the following vehicle from japan the vehicle is not in a bond store now if you don't know what a bond store is it means that there is some sort of a warehouse in the port in durban these cars come in they get stored there and

(Start: 00:09:10)
they get sold off to malawi zimbabwe swaziland etc etc now these cars cannot be purchased or registered in south africa at least not as a road going car perhaps a track car now this car i bought direct from japan it was not in a bond store at all so um you got to fill in this form you got to give that to the guys next so the next step is with saws you need to fill in this documentation and it's this particular anatomy and you need to sign up as an importer okay so you're importing and you put in all your details or you're doing it yourself you're clearing agent now i'll discuss the clearing agent in a second and you put in all your details etc etc and you send that through sound all of that sort of stuff okay then you're going to chat to a clearing and forwarding agent

(Start: 00:10:11)
now my caring and forwarding agent was diamond shipping services okay now these guys arranged all the shipping with the guys in japan they discussed what ship was going on how it's going to get across et cetera et cetera and it'll all the clearing and forwarding for the vehicle um now this car came from kobe japan um this letter was issued in osaka so this letter comes from size that there's a response saying that has been granted they can send the vehicle overseas but you need to get all your paperwork in order make sure that you clear those stars so my ship was the morning champion okay the car left the port on the 13th of october 2013 and arrived roughly a month later to durban south africa now this is another document from the shop it just states that it's going to durban this is the supplier where the car was now the car came from

(Start: 00:11:12)
the auction house and it went to some sort of checking place they mentioned the cars okay then got loaded onto the shop and through these guys i got loaded on the shop and they put in all the details yeah my engine number my chassis number etc etc okay there's another latin letter from size this is a customs notification letter just to say that this car is coming on morning champion and it arrived on this date and it's cleared for entry into the country once that's all sent through you get a confirmation letter now this letter you will get first fax to you and then you'll get a original copy sent to you now this letter comes from the international trade administration commission of south africa um it comes through very quickly you'll generally get the facts within two days so you're going to say to them hey guys i want to import this mazda rx-7 um can i do it they'll come back to you and say yes or no and i'll send you this letter okay so it was quite simple and let's

(Start: 00:12:13)
zoom in a little bit yeah so um this letter basically authorizes you to import the particular vehicle and they state that it's innocent scholar or 32 the engine number the chassis number and it being a collector's answer or collector's vehicle this vehicle may not be offered lent hired least pledged given or exchanged sold or otherwise be disposed of in south africa for a period of two years from the date of clearance for home consumption into the republic now for you if you don't gets understand that's day one the day the car gets licensed and on the road and you put your first license sticker on that coin you get your number plate you cannot sell that car you cannot lend it to anyone you cannot lend let people drive that car without you being in the passenger seat now for some that sucks

(Start: 00:13:14)
um i'm not sure what the rules are overseas but but here i mean i would have loved to lend my call to some people some friends etc but couldn't happen fortunately my car is now older than two years and it's been licensed for more than two years i can sell it not that i'm going to so this letter is very important with this letter you can then purchase the vehicle because this is my customs declaration form it's just to state that the exporter were the guys in japan the importer was myself my agent here is impact plus trading as freight impact um and that came on morning champion et cetera et cetera the weight of the car 1480 and then obviously your price and how much you're paying size and all the calculations okay next this is from the shipping company um this is from the shipper and it's coming to me i'm the consignee where did they load the car they loaded

(Start: 00:14:14)
the car in sakai san boko japan came on morning champion too durban to africa so this is skyline there's my chassis an engine number that's how much the car weighs etc etc impact plus trading um now these guys they arranged everything they were actually my clearing agent i made a mistake earlier so they use diamond shipping um those are the transport transporters these were the clearing agents so this size edi notification means that they can release the car they gave the car to me from there i need to do quite a few things such as larsen zhang wei bridge etc which we're going to okay so here's the big one this is your nrcs letter so this is your natural national regulator for compulsory specifications so we've got something here called sabs and it's essentially your um your bureau of

(Start: 00:15:16)
standards in southern africa or south africa and they make sure that your car has a steering wheel it has four wheels it's got a braking system and headlights and blah blah blah so that make sure it's compliant and suitable for our roads so we we fill in all the details here and you send them something first i don't have the original document anymore and they send something back with the stamp to say it's okay um however they do check the car first so are there any modifications no they didn't know any better um there's a personal use yes there's my details my address etc it's a collector's item it's okay skyline r32 gtr came from japan 93 the mass was 1500 kilos should have been slightly lighter but i think we went in with full tank and oils and everything for engine size etc okay and this comes from pretoria which is quite far from me about six seven hundred kilometers away now when you're fetching the car you

(Start: 00:16:17)
have to get a permit so you do this first so you get a police identification form you put in your details here your chassis number and your engine number and they will sell you something called a 21 day permit that permit gets stuck to the back of your windscreen obviously you don't need number plates you'll be driving with this permit your car will be legal on the road for 21 days within those 21 days you've got to do a couple of things you've got to get your certificate of road worthy for the vehicle which means that you need to make sure that the car has fun it's driving there's no leaks there's braking system works etc that's one of the things you need to do there's many testing stations all over durbin the next one is a way bridge you need to take the car for weighing so the car is supposed to be at one four eight zero for my particular model 93 and up um it came in a 1560 i don't remember why i think there might have been stuff in the boot or full of fuel i don't i don't remember but it should have been 148 though so it

(Start: 00:17:19)
came in one five six oh now this is obviously your weight that will be on the car when you license and will be on your paperwork so unfortunately you're showing 1560 for me okay this is your certificate of roadworthy your cr they didn't fail me on anything everything was working there's a whole check sheet that they go through and make sure the car is running and everything's fine on the car so they passed my vehicle no problem and that got passed a few days after the raft exactly seven days after it arrived and back to my auction sheet so guys thereafter you got to do your cr your way bridge your data dotting you need to keep going back to the police station back and forth and keep getting affidavit stamped so that you can get more sorry not f affidavits you need to go back to the police station every now and again it's going to get more commission off so

(Start: 00:18:20)
you can actually import that you can actually get additional 21 day permits so you can draft the car on the road and it takes time it took about seven eight months to get the car licensed on the road but once it was done the car is here and it's running great guys if you want me to go into more detail on this sort of stuff let me know hit me up in the comments section or you can find me on facebook let me know what you want to know about this sort of stuff i can give you some guidelines how i found out who i dealt with in japan to help me buy the cars if you guys want any help let me know in the comments section or hit me up on facebook i'd love to hear from you guys it's cool getting some discussion going obviously i don't know your laws overseas but i may be able to have help in the japanese side perhaps on the buyer's end the auction side whatever you may need to know um like i said earlier if you do need an import in north america you can contact rb motoring

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up girls welcome to episode 2 of buying JDM cars online today we're going to look at some Japanese rarely legends so Subaru Impreza's mitsubishi evos and tiana cinakisz same format applause we look at cause a low value and high value and we look at different models within the ranges so let's get going we're going to start off with the Seabury family and of course you're going to go straight to the STRs low prices now let's pick a couple are we going to take it's like two buggers so we'll take two of each guess a to each all right let's get this on the road so 97 WRX STI version 3 about tier these man we're not WRX STI else they would just straight WRX is one of the top RN in South Africa

(Start: 00:01:02)
we call them GT turbos I think that's UK as well so you can see the version 1 all the way up to version 5 they have these two little bint thingies in the front also the grill here old headlights not to my liking this is actually a wagon so I've never had a JDM gc8 wagon before I've had a bugger wagon I was quite fun and this car looks really stuck pretty boring that I hate I hate those with a passion I think they stopped doing it on the version 6 you can see these old models is the ej20 motor there's no coil packs they've got these coil leads on the side obviously as your spark plugs to on the side T on this side and then you've got these leads coming in to the top and it sits on this little packet the top of the miter behind the alternator it's not very neat obviously

(Start: 00:02:03)
easier to work on then having individual coil packs there's an extra wires and sits in the top doesn't look so cool so this is a 97 TD the tables for the ej20 might sell stock steering wheel kaalix pretty much stuck to me obviously that's not stuck that's not stuck that looks like a table time over there is T our seats amplify on the beat exhaust looks stuck as or 33 okay boring let's move on okay here's the n98 version for three and a half thousand dollars so with shipping to me this is to Durban South Africa it's four thousand six hundred dollars of bad and colleagues are at those are the JDM tell lots most models then have

(Start: 00:03:05)
that rear tinted windows that's all factory these are the factory 16 inch runs see there's a bit of rare share on the on the back reflux occur but a roster are not again quail leads this is prevision sucks tires are care is the 16th 205 50 16 str seeds stock wheel I'll see the gate has been changed yeah that's been charged this boost gauge boost gauge in the top different gear knob 122,000 and nice old school apex e boost gauge greeku turbo timer right this is also I've mass this is a V limited says the top all right I had one of these models are WRX top are a not the STR also version four and one was also be limited you're not a lot of

(Start: 00:04:06)
photos very cool if you want to connect this item theory high mileage 200,000 for the most part these motor should come out anyway be rebuilt and you're looking at about four and a half maybe five thousand dollars at 50 grand in markers see if you want to rebuild fully forged bottom end and that's what's a capacitance arp head studs bolts rods pretty much okay that's good let's look at bye guys so 2001 very nice i didn't quite like i said before only after only one i started enjoying them and lock yet so i bought a WRX wagon 2002 model it lasted a couple weeks that the rebuild motor fully forged ran 80 do 6 20 g on it and actually i had a GT 28 ras the

(Start: 00:05:10)
disco potato on for a little while stock mount location i think it was an aps unit that didn't last too long is in charge 40 years 6 20 g it was a full stroker kit i'll put a link in here to the car we did the striker kit so we got a 2.2 i think what we did is we used the 2.5 crank and different pistons I think we had manly rods with Sakai pistons or CP pistons and I quite remember I've had man of these cars it's all a big blur to me and so this one squad knows it's got the Alcantara seats stock interior boys or defi gauges this difficult role unit stock steering wheel str pedal covers it's actually really neat this is up to six speed on it under the car looks pretty good rainbows and your looks what cool let's close that move on there's

(Start: 00:06:11)
another bug are five and a half thousand dollars it's actually really good money for what you're giving these came out in 276 horsepower or 200 kilowatts plus/minus ej20 it came with the VF 35 and the VF 34 tippers I think these blue bars have the VA 34 Taylor good for about 400 horsepower with a bit of tuning and the exhaust down pipe fuel pump and bigger injectors and obviously a retune high boost you looking at Ford it was bar on these this is quite neat so on the sea breeze side in these cars were legends on its own in the rayleigh world having won 90 95 with colin mcrae there was them the GC eight it was at the triple five model i think was a commemorated vision then 2001 with richard burns and i think it was 2003 with Petter Solberg and that was that

(Start: 00:07:11)
shortly after that sebree pulled out of the rally stages quite levas HKS coilovers Reno's actually look really neat they look quite near str back box if i was ok for one and i was going to import our battles car ok let's look at blob us so this guy's got some decals in this car that will come on straight away if you at the buyer mud flaps are not standard the decals are non-standard this little exhaust guard is not standard actually quite ugly very  idea to be honest tickle spacing between all the nuts he's got the little JDM sti logo on the back those stickers are hard oh my god ok he's up the interior so this is all been sprayed blue all surroundings please something's up in the steering wheel it looks like a cover yeah first thing covered come off all those who go back to stock I don't know so much about all the play so this

(Start: 00:08:14)
is a an a3 with DCCCD I may be wrong maybe somewhat let me know in the comments but as far as on here dcccd only came out in the i5 model unless they've changed the cluster pack alternator shields been put on she has a hard pops it up for the intake stock air box is still on the car he's prickly Stephanie going to drop in filter in text standard intercooler standard he's got a grounding kit on the car here scrap price is not standard is it alternative shield can see something's been donya something's been done with the vacuum that sets your vacuum out of the the manifold they been on one of those zero sports I had one of these in one let's get back to it so this little radiator shroud very cool drops the intake temps by a few degrees sway bars down of the brand it looks like 26 or 28

(Start: 00:09:14)
milk very nice there's a couple mods that would differently come over in the car stickers off that off the eyes off you know a good price you're probably pick up something similar in your respective countries for around the same price ince africa you looking at about 120 130 for the same thing okay let's get rid of that this one looks highly modded he's got a wide body kit on the car new front bumper dino the branding and what actually this is a choice people and i had one of these in locker that's not standard it's what brain bears he's got different wheels on the car that's the pride rock beat that looks horrid i'll change that very quickly actually just you can see it's too much as little asian manly interior looks neat that's pretty shitty about bring the 3ds they i'll take the street is out of it and cause any issues seats

(Start: 00:10:15)
like a cakes and for that it's got DC CD as well someone let me know if the JDM models had dcccd far as on either in south africa we had a 304 blah bars nandi ccd well this is centered the flock same position as the I 5-ht RSX i7 etc so this is a V limited they made 555 ok so this is a stock engine bay looks ready to be stuck it actually looks very very neat strut price I'm not sure this V limited model did chemicals as everything else looks good I don't 26,000 case look if you want it i connect this awesome must probably a good bar drop it everything next standard or these bumpers but it gets processed a little bit half right there I can a whole car this one looks look winked and looks

(Start: 00:11:16)
like Emma can auction as well and then so I 5607 with the whole cars these at the ej25 engines in it these are the two point five ter guys they had the DF 43 turbos in them and same rated horsepower the torque shut up dramatically they are very cool cause I like little car and we're not on the blob art and particularly like it with the new shape that came up it's grown on me and to be honest I think as one of the better shapes now I'll still have a huge soft spot for the g CH there ok this is boring a consummate on this course I'm gonna close that eleven thousand dollars for the scar it's bendy wind he's a fog locks on earth a pint looks average wheels look like they need a bit of a shine see the brain bars on your black this is definitely a JDM model you can tell by the red button I red button appear that everything else looks pretty much standard def he gauges ok we didn't

(Start: 00:12:20)
get this in South Africa or at least not with us with the ice successive and models that we have the Alcantara and the middle of blue with a black around I wouldn't borrow this one these your electronic toll collection system stock black box is tr top on it is stock diffuser looks a bit rusty on on the side look too good to be honest and you can see a bit of rusty on the one puddi and that's the air conditioner pump pulley that sad little rusty little water damage whereas that's going to form in here at price as well although it does look pretty stuck on ok not for me anyway that's severe and one day we will chat about what I had and what I've done to them today we're just looking at other peoples cause they're let's move on so let's start of some

(Start: 00:13:21)
evos because i'm actually i'm knocking the bowler looking at at high prices on these course let's after we done with all them let's go look for some really nice limited models and teera silly card will be the collar size limited edition and on the slippery side let's go look for pro draw p1 or let's go look for a 20 be on the eve our side click a ralliart let's take a look okay so this is the evil 5 I think this looks pretty  I would change that very quickly you can see a bit of damage on there from the exhaust when it's been sprayed broad seat with a hell of a tear that

(Start: 00:14:21)
looks like masking tape Jesus so I think this cause turn around there the track quarter but I don't know what's going on here there's obviously a gauge there was in place their stock steering wheels are this one's missing the centerpiece radios missing you see it's got the push release cling the drift disease that on a on the hand brakes well rust is forming their this this does not look like a good barn four thousand dollars that's a lot of money so in our electric window is still there door handles I suppose if if you want to ready the call or track the course of probably the right one just fix bit of the rust rip everything outside that's one hell of a straight path this must be already caught they generally just put straight pops like also out the side so that it doesn't catch on the ground quite a Buster a lot lots of rust appallingly

(Start: 00:15:21)
rust on that side rust in the bolts to 35 40 s decent let's get rid of that car okay again 98 that you have five as far as i know but much better these are the stock stock seats pretty cool okay here's the miter so this motor is the 4g63 TD the turbo and I think these earlier models at five speed boxes the evo 7 8 9 10 have left six speeds for also know how you can with the TT 0 5 20 g on these service it's somewhere in the front sure I think underneath is heat shield here's your intake obviously the skies with a heat shield on edge then sign it the vacuums I'm guessing these controller sets over here I don't have too much about Evo's here's your overflow tank for the water coming with the radiator he's got a dump valve here looks like a

(Start: 00:16:25)
teal dunk low if i'm not mistaken yeah okay so 05 it's a little bit exhaust okay something's up with the rear brakes but rusty and don't know what gauges those are they look around tweeters would come out power boost controller so this is actually the boost controller oh okay fan switch okay so this guy's got a fan control he's doing from yeah he's not doing it by the ECU six thousand dollars still got a money feels call look for the next one okay this looks like it you guys seven to me let's see what it says is little seven ct9a i think this could potentially be a evo 8 7 and 8 look so similar to me and wing looks hard rainbows on there yeah anyway

(Start: 00:17:31)
um it's a cool-looking car from the inside from the outside the interior looks very blend if you look at it I don't particular kit let's move on this looks like another evo 8 okay so maybe the other one was the Eva eight so the front ends a lot more refined in other models and the back as well the wing much more different you see there's a lot more shape on the back back bumper looks pretty cool that's its to be honest it's not as aggressive as the others the seats look a hell of a lot better than the previous model lost Recaros in there and that's missing that's cheap to replace given up and the Gator looks pretty good now steering wheel factory intake service it's down here somewhere I don't know if this hot papa factory I care so this acd I think that's your act of your control or active differential so you can switch

(Start: 00:18:32)
between tarmac gravel and snow on these guys and that act of your controls for ozone layer it pushes power from left to right front to back citrusy handlings really good on these girls I've only ever driven an EVO 8 lots of fun didn't get to thrash around too much but it did feel a lot more planted then pretty much all of my series obviously not the ones that I had modified in had coilovers on them but stock for stock of us did feel a lot more planted okay as evo 6 not to me that evo 6 looks a lot more aggressive than all the others the rear not so much I prefer the real on the seven in the eighth and mom but the front of the car looks very aggressive when your steering wheel stock Diffie controller defeat Gators stock gear knob stop stop Gator stood up to speed wheel

(Start: 00:19:33)
intake has been done tiba is right there somewhere Israel manifold okay so strut brace so 9000 that's a lot of money well then not a lot of these models came in South Africa say it was ready to see one on the road and enter anyone okay and it'sit's move on okay next that's the suspect emerged ominous i ironed a tiara silica in the past that was a st 185 collar signed limited edition from the tiara silica registry we could see it was the only one in South Africa koala phone call 3sgte mighty chilly today before your drive foil steering shed a lot of things in common with the GTR to be honest in terms of draft rain might say obviously displacement was an 80 litre and okay these are very cheap i'm not going to bother going right down on the bottom here because they are non turbo here's a st one at five that's

(Start: 00:20:35)
turbocharged a lot of these new jeans here I'm actually not interested in though that all I'm looking for is t1 at five is t 205 okay so the reason why I'm not looking at these these are non turbo charged there were eighteen hundreds there were front wheel drive so boring okay let's take the scar here and that's it that's not a highest cross okay let's start here so st 105 in see this is not a lot of special editions as a normal one it's got the standard Vince got the hood scoop on the top and the collar Saints had a little hole on the side and it was covered with a charge cooler underneath very boring look to an exhaust that's step stock here's a fuel

(Start: 00:21:39)
tank quite a large fuel tank get seats of stock that's what's a pretty  that's not meant to be on the car okay here's the indicator at the top of this turbo um quite a large turbo at a was the same tailor came with your supra I don't remember what size it is exactly and this looks very stock it isn't really dirty and so obviously on the commemorative models the swirl they charge kill on the top here this plate was a little bit different too and most of them a lot cleaner I can this car is like it's cheap and if you want something to just throw around this is probably a good price I don't know what else needs to be done our st205 so this one looks like it's had quite a bit of work done sir and looks like it's in hard condition bonus not closing properly weird front bumper it looks

(Start: 00:22:39)
like an oil cooler definitely an oil killer constable front mountain 80 knots it engages a pixie a vcr y de friendly front man so you can see now this is going down to the front here's a table sitting at the top de finir different Tabor and looks like a hundred mil HK smash units on their highest prices are done quite a bit of stuff is done on it is you dump valve the stock seats a pretty shipped he's got a nice broad seat in the car it's actually pretty cool but it's a lot of money for not now or could potentially be wrong with his car plus the mods on very tasteful another st205 now this looks stock this is what I like there is three last interior stock wheel this is the coiler agua lastly then stock charge kill on the top HD two files can recharge key to the first st 185 was the college saints

(Start: 00:23:40)
that came out of the trash kita don't what that means blah blah blah moscow now this bonnet is similar to what is on the collar size very nice i buy this car ok another HT 205 I don't know it's a special of this 132 pictures me anyway ok guys so obviously there's no silica so we can look at said its enclosing let's go and look and see if we can find any limited models of 20 b or prodrug p1 and anything on the EVO side which means we're going to have to look at the most expensive I'm assuming let's change that to your heart zillow okay yes a new genes new age STRs is the hatches it's a

(Start: 00:24:41)
lot of money for that hooker nice so the uverse I'd sorry I said ready odd earlier and we'll pray be your fq 300 if you 400 I think there's a 380 in there as well on a year I got here's an 01 I guess on the evo 7 so that looks pretty smart some rust on there that's easy to pull off just unbolt he out of the manifold let's just both onto the top of the manifold just do a raspberry form clean up this is easy to take off and clean one of the first things that are done before selling the car stock steering wheel gauges are not stuck and see some sort of control down here possibly a pixie that's got the six-speed on it turbo Tama and something else there thirty-eight thousand cases

(Start: 00:25:44)
this car is neat those are diffuse it's probably a def you can try little below this is some sort of blitz controller I'm guessing boost this is very nice yeah very cool ok next G is our lawn guess this isn't even on you can see how different the front end is just a lot more refined grain us kill any three pictures boring ok goodbye you both care we stuck with us two thousand model you can see the difference like I said area this doesn't have those two dolphins is learning at the one the bumpers shape is a little bit more different these cover is a different on the older models there's four bolts over here one day one day and one day this has just got the one and then there's clips on the other side those wheels are quickly been

(Start: 00:26:47)

Title: Project R32 GTR - Battery Relocation Part 1
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoov3NbOBg

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up Gus welcome to project or 32 GTR today we are relocating the battery to the boot so I'm going to be moving the svatah e 20 for battery it's the 70 M power version with 630 M cranking power decent battery I've had it for about three years full running fun okay so here's the engine bay how it currently looks because I'll do before and off the shot list so there's a couple of wise they're gonna be coming out here obviously this positive wire here is going to be connected to that zero gauge cable then I showed you guys in the previous video this is gonna be coming out those are the water temperature sensor that's dead here's the end of it that's also going

(Start: 00:01:00)
to be coming up and grounding is the beginning to the chassis okay so let's backtrack here what we need we're going to need one or two of these 150 amp hour fuses and bodies from a local hardware store that'll sell this to you or electronics store you're going to need some zero gauge cable I've got five and a half meters here should be sufficient obviously we'll see at the end of this video that is going to be connected to the positive end here and obviously that's going to run through the piece so I'm gonna walk you guys through everything we're gonna need some new battery terminals this is gonna go over C on the battery and that's gonna sit inside the boot end and you're gonna need some additional wire for the grounding etc so we're going a little

(Start: 00:02:02)
bit ghetto with the recording obviously my gorilla mount has arrived the gorilla tripod so I have cable Todd my dash cam here and I'm gonna be forming the process from there alright let's get started goes

(Start: 00:06:37)
so cuz I've completely underestimated this job it turned out to be a little bit more of a bollock than I thought it would be the reason being is this 150 amp fuse holder that I've got is a piece of it doesn't fit the zero gauge cable properly so I've made a plan and this will get me going for the next couple days you remember the cause not driving right now because the clutch this is fun for now I will get a different one for the front so here's my surrogate cable see what I've done of why that in today the Survival Plan here and wide that back in and then these mothers are engaged now is there a good it's gonna go down here and I'm going to use a coat hanger a metal coat hanger to get it through what's going to happen is it's going to pop out just underneath this go out of it here okay so I'm gonna have to jack the car up either remove the wheel or pull this god-awful I've done it

(Start: 00:07:39)
before they'll taking the wheel both good see how we can go with zero edges a bit bigger once it's in there's a grommet just over here somewhere I'm gonna push the coat hanger through the grommet obviously with this in Tartu it and it's gonna come out in the drivers footwell and then from the obviously follow the troubles etc and I'm gonna go to the back of the boot we I'm gonna mount the battery so judging by the melted cable that I've got five and a half meters not gonna coat so I might be wrong and we'll see how we go if it doesn't then I'll give another fuse box or fuse holder and I'll mount it in the back so so far we've moved the battery there's a lot of dirt and here there's a lot of Tina needs to happen I would HID headlights in here and this seems to be the power for it so it's all I want to redo all the cabling redo all the wiring the grounding needs to go to the chassis

(Start: 00:08:39)
sorry pull that end off I bought a bunch of ends here so that's like on a wire that's going to go to the chassis and then obviously put fruit in from the battery side that's going to wire to the battery but you see one of these okay girls we on day two now had a bit of an emergency as to this I was never

(Start: 00:09:39)
to continue to work however we are carrying on today so as you saw jacked up the car I pulled off the mudguard and I've just hooked it on to the tire they can still be a cat squat gerbil now hopefully you can see inside here okay can different PC there is a big grommet there and that big cable is something here's a grommet there now we're gonna feed our red zero gauge through here now we're gonna have to come through the top I'm going to use a coat hanger coming up and up hook it on so this red wire and we're gonna push it through I'll show you guys know okay here is a coat hanger before this is a metal coat hanger flexible coins one might work you can take a set of pliers and you're gonna bend it until you get something

(Start: 00:10:40)
like this so you just want one long piece as straight as possible and we're gonna feed this through the back here and on this end obviously that needs to be straightened too we're gonna tie it on the end of the zero gauge as you can see how fit through the zero gauge pulled everything through already that's down on the floor now the next step like I showed you guys just give it three let chroma

(Start: 00:11:54)
you know I have my doubts about getting the zero gauge cable through this firewall and I managed to do it I've only really pushed little cables like this and that was a challenge on its own this wasn't so bad I guess the trick that I learned on the last time is it you gotta wrap the metal around and then tape it up don't be afraid to use a lot of tape and then obviously the research is brute force just push it through let's be scared just push it we're gonna break the car and your cable will get through there it is okay so obviously the next step from here is I'm gonna pull over these panels off all this trim and we're gonna hide the cable underneath there we're going to follow the reach into the back

(Start: 00:13:07)
okay gasps sorry for not showing this on video but you'll know I'm waiting for my trap load so I've pulled off that guy which said over here and I've started feeding all the cable through here now this was rather tiring and you got to get your hand in some weird places but I left everything hanging from the top so everything was on the Sun and I took the end and I fit it through here first so put one hand underneath this carpet on the back way the back seat is my other hand over here and I started feeding it through here and I caught it with my other hand pulled it through and here does okay so everything is tucked in overseas cameraman tuck these guys back in and I'm gonna start closing up I've decided I'm gonna cut this video here and upload it so this will be part one I think if I had to carry on now you guys will probably be waiting till next week I can't do too much obviously pregnant wife so I'm gonna probably continue the

(Start: 00:14:11)
rest of this next week and push the silicone hoses to the following week so let me show you what I've done so far let's recap I have sort of this thing out or camera sorry about that managed to get them in lastly but still temporary I'm gonna buy a decent one now also why I'm deciding on making the support tears because I'm a dumbass and I forgot to pull this through firewall so I'm gonna jack up the car again and pull out that old water temperature phase go over see this side is going to come out when we do the silly okay so battery is Alps red cables through all the wiring is done I need to do a major cleanup over here now and so will be that in part two grounding still needs to be ripped open and attached to the chassis whatever cleanup and the engine bones

(Start: 00:15:12)
required in the interior I've closed up the kick panel over there bear in mind I am missing that one little bolt on the side otherwise it's back to normal nice and neat just needs a bit of a vacuum this floor guard that's all in no behind the seat there's my cable yes I was right it is a bit short my apologies it's four and a half meters they obviously gave me the wrong amount in charge me for five and a half so I'm gonna put another fuse on the end another 150 amp and another two metres links that I got today so that isn't a guy on the back there that little panel is gonna come out I need to do some Wyatt Rd up so that'll happen in part two and the battery will get mounts from the bit I will see grounding everything needs to be complete otherwise that's

(Start: 00:16:15)
pretty much it battery relocation part one buying JDM cars online video if you haven't seen it go check it out let me know if that interests you I'm looking for something to fill the gaps obviously when baby is here I'm gonna need to spend as much time as possible especially the first couple of weeks and my wife is at home and I'm gonna be helping you to help and I can't spend all my time in the garage so I'm trying to get all these mods out of the way now and we're looking probably another three to four weeks worth of mods thereafter it's gonna have to be some low key in front of computer table things talking  etc they may know if you guys enjoy that I'll do some full of videos until I can start working on the car probably two to three months thereafter you can start working now us appreciate all the subscribers if you're watching this he said subscribe let's keep this channel guy otherwise lock and comment

(Start: 00:17:18)
guys I really appreciate you and thank you for the comments and the feedback I really appreciate most you guys are very kind thanks a lot guys I will see you next week with part 2 of battery relocation Cheers

that passion for the car to fold it up and do it your way and do it right and
walk away and say I did this the carport corner shit was fully partners and now

timing our foot let me put this video together in what is the one common thing
that is car guys to that one common thing is going online browsing looking
at second hand cars looking at some new

(Start: 00:01:00)
cause and for us it's JDM cause skylines
keepers rx7 eccentric so I figured this is look at a couple international salts
locals African sites look at how process is lengthy process cause talk shit so
obviously this trade coffee and foremost you guys know about this odd because
some sort of Japan we you can look at specific vehicles and see selling them
get process of shopping and gets in from Japan to your country or destination so
scholars going to set to like to house I the cheapest collar on here are my
babies those are 32 g CR let's take this take
the top three lowest ones of any type of car so you got three tips it open this
one right now or not so it looks like

(Start: 00:02:02)
stock intercooler bit of road rash in
the front number plate holders look about funky in genetics pretty good to
be honest obviously the intake manifold that gets
a bit flaky and it comes off there's some stabilizer brace on a strut bar he's got intakes on looks average this
is an 89 it's pretty old first one to come up on the bonnet looks like it's
off the market I don't necklaces but some things on it it also made me get
back to it looks like loss differently for growth want to cool with a different
quick check but always going to moms 320 kph dash quite
ask where you're spending too much time

(Start: 00:03:03)
in this club said looking 103,000 very
good option for EM has to go so hard and this one here to that looks a lot but
you see the way you can pull it off it's got some weird-looking risen up the
front bumpers black doesn't have the in one cat on a particular like the in one
kit makes a color code meet after the anyone come on this was on the back of
my car with that kind of came off on marketing it looks pretty shitty without
the way and to be honest I don't think it looks good with that these stock
original wing season brought up clips on there and such pretty stuck other than
the intakes has been changed colors and

(Start: 00:04:14)
changing them allows its pretty start of
our brothers back and someone with some shit on that s the mileage original
knowledge has the mileage 30,000 case and it's gonna roll cage and missing all
the fucking shipping yet so this was probably a racecar and I look easy is
lying on the floor this was probably an x-ray scar guys try
to get it back to stock with random parts and now they're selling for twelve
thousand dollars the weather looks like my car and I
would not buy this car looks pretty wait next she's looking at these photos we're gonna take these photos of the
pineapple

(Start: 00:05:20)
ok let's skip this let's change change
let's go look at the most expensive one so what's out there ok because asking process ok so the first couple also your 35
hours are the most expensive care is no 34 this pic its opening that and let's
take this guy hates you well that is that was pumpkin i would
not a what-what make . it is a bit chargespeed with psyphon stand for
protection when looks pretty awesome actually in the whole wide body kit
think it's pretty awesome will filter relocation camp now this is exactly what
I'm gonna be doing at some stage oil

(Start: 00:06:23)
catch can oil filter relocation kit exactly this
is so beyond all 34 is a lot more space I'm moving my bedroom to the rear and
i'm going to be doing us that looks cool I need to do this alluminium popular get
some stage hear enough about my car we're looking at people's cause 68,000
k's 19 on model is pretty cool and that's not cool sixty-eight thousand
dollars that's a fuck ton of money ok moving on last speak to sixty
thousand dollars or about 7,000 and Mark currency clouds around is currently the 1350 yeah
it was a lot of money

(Start: 00:07:24)
sorry 800 mom thousand REDD+ you going
to pay import duties text blah blah blah you name it was causing the city back
1.1 1.2 before Lance after ok let's change it up let's look at some other
brands that statistical super 402 pro 44 them for so how many scholars me for
sale let's go click that critique and
weariness on skyline gt-r hundred and eight and again it stopped start from
later haha try to be consistent all this shit okay so four thousand dollars will
get you that whatever that maybe I'm

(Start: 00:08:33)
gonna bother opening this caucus and
back this box shape . it's a mark 3 we're looking more for sure and it's
cool slightly higher is good for this round six thousand dollars cool so 95 it is a is said I think that
is said was normally aspirated model i'm a GTR man so stand for pregnancy when
you get the engine by Jesus cross what happened to that room what ok so and what is 800 and this is a
standard room and this is some other pieces should tire with some fucking
terrible ring that you know let me look in Syria expect you need actually looks
pretty decent interior for decent for 4,000 of the comment that that should
come right over and plus its ordering

(Start: 00:09:37)
you can drop the box you can change your
manual quite cheap cool blah blah blah interior hundred thousand
case there you go normally aspirated to
jersey GT e-- is the tables just to jay-z something to jay-z she ed I think

the big place and just really 220 well I'm living on the comments hit me up I'd
love to iron ore but I've been pulled off the collectors awesomeness Africa

around the streets and probably a lot more than they are all 32 of our numbers
are climbing as a lot of people are

(Start: 00:10:38)
starting to bother thirties when ok we
look at different input is called up probably pretty intense for
thousand-dollar about 50,000 and call it a hundred thousand by tom clancy maybe
about seven thousand dollars before days state i'm away with how important to
stripper change the mindset change the box obviously suspension brakes throwing
those rooms there in that room and carry on from there or a couple hundred more
dollars and looking at the sky looks needs got ass exhausted maybe not

charity box what the fuck happened on the back seat

six thousand dollars i'm guessing it's also very good movement spread
piece-of-shit lower blood rather by the other ones that look like a race to time
or not say I will not talk shit how to life why not let's go for this one thirty
thousand dollars however the cheaper than buying a scale
on 434 other that these bagels $15,000

honor and then everyone was getting it is he's into his old crap and the other
day I mentioned to me you know what car yet he really likes them in 63 measure
or exhibit almost fell off my chair when I heard this I was like pretty crappy
that's one of my favorite cause its rear-wheel drive all the above-mentioned
it's been in one game but not initial d you name it it's the ultimate cold car
one of the limit these and he locks it so I've been trying to push into our
acceptance always freaking Jaguar or some old crap that keeps coming up and
that gets forest anyway enough painting

(Start: 00:16:53)
he was 14 6800 here's one for 6863 so is
one 4400 looks looks but it looks like someone made this themselves and crash
that little bit when wing is awesome that that looks public with i'm guessing
that some sort of event the intercoastal inside farzana yeah IM not street-legal I guess
so those Lots can pull the sadness kind of feeding some fresh in today and
Douglas car looks like it's been great hey that's my steering with that's
pretty cool idea of letters have teratoma something blah blah blah serve

rear seats like that ok there's some rusty looks like the oil
cooler there and ah yeah I owned with his cock ok next six thousand dollars 7540 again
David those looks cool are staring or our seats are stages nice placement for
the gauges very cool place my looks like you scheduled in the center so very drop
of focus to just go back to this prick you sitting in the seat however certain rx7 one's worried about
88 years ago at least and when you in the cards very dropping
focused on your left hand is Roger by the handbrake you've got so much control
your promptness t-those are talking off

(Start: 00:19:02)
the market see towers in the stock seat
and II just have that sense that you all the cars all about the driver and I've
always liked the car that looks like some sort of timer my dear on broad seat
broad seats awesome and shared a little bit part anyway and developed pretty
neat looks pretty stuck there so seven silicon hoses on getting something was
done the Beast other products good if your gauges if we control unit looks
like it's in the glove compartment probably advance with some little bit
better are probably would have mounted here right there ok next one is just run through squatchy
stock steering wheels last oxtails and

(Start: 00:20:07)
very good condition shit again up I'm teratoma very shitty getting a
little some kind of fucking tree and decided to
put on their little bit of stuffs there cool cool what's cool about that is neat
that is very need those off the market but this is still here you need locket let's dump file i had one of those
together one of those two for anyone should exhaust fan coil overs street I
guess let's teratoma and BBS wheels blah let's just look at one expensive example
I don't know for the most part I enough i'm pretty sure that almost everyone of
us are watching will want to buy something in the lower to medium price
range and more than likely won't be hot

(Start: 00:21:12)
and filled it up make it better have
that passion for the car to build it up and do it your way and do it right and
walk away and say I did this the carport color and shit was fully partners and
now look at it now it's also nice because of me so I myself even if i had
the money i would not buy something like those this is just too needs is to
complete and it's the reflection of someone else it's not me it is cool what does pioneer DVD player the
electronic toll collection system thanks Scotty Cranmer I had this in one in his
GTR r32 any when he brought it on into the states and he was very confused when
this was that thing talks to you and I'm guessing you put your credit card of
david carpenter and the box money every

(Start: 00:22:14)
time you go through it all again if that
what else it looks district a couple few calls the GTRs we looked at supers we looked
at the rx7 and obviously there's a whole lot about you JD and cause and if you
guys like this video let me know please let me know in the comments i'll do
another one but let's stick to four calls for the mark and if you do like
those i'll make another video just lockers and so there's obviously
holidays 2600 NSX is this i can go on and on and on let's look at the last one and let's get
back to business and brand sort of conflict forget supers ahead mom them in
the past my spaceship some of them not and regardless i had naan and that's a
whole different story on its own tell

(Start: 00:23:16)
you guys in the future listen soval is 15 speak r-spec is
whatever you give it to me I'll take it I would love one as a daily driver just
to get to work and back i had the opportunity go by about six years ago
millions africa i think there's pretty under 10 it was 12 kilometers from my
love and it was more of a swap swap the Safari or city and paying a little bit
of cash and I lost out on that deal i decided against that I can recreate that
but then again I probably wouldn't have had the GTR didn't do that in stickers
with the series that's we will get into this one down so you guys working
college degree story ok again so let's pick + 1 2 3 and let's
go hard

(Start: 00:24:26)
I'm just going to get tested for
stimulation teens so first one speck is why it's going off so special but it got
fog lamp and alloy wheels what else are you gonna have cardboard
against one doesn't have the wing it makes you look but ID and you got to
have been stalking i'm actually around the corner so I'm just going to go kill
that and this was the thing that was the fucking is 14 I don't see there's 14 there is 15 this is the exact color that our

dollars that is absolutely plus all money that's an order it's a non Tabor but fuck it you can
spend 20,000 and let's say under two

(Start: 00:26:30)
thousand dollars you can place or 20 TN
you put a manual 5-speed and you're done and do it yourself it's not that
difficult and another one electrode talking whole
collection system it's got back boxes looks like a stock car to be honest
looks like nobody's touched that we also pretty cool so it's got a small tree
piston calculator single post on the bag and yeah engine base clean it's very
clean I don't know what that's all about but
that might hold came out of systems in my hands I like it hundred thousand

Title: Project R32 GTR - Parts have arrived!
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CiDoyS3nZk

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys uh doing a bit of an unboxing video today uh some stuff sured from China thing it is I'm presuming it is my silic and hoses it feels like my silic hoses so I haven't opened them yet I'm hoping that they are red what I ordered and not blue the original picture was blue I asked the guys please send red they said the package has been sent didn't say whether it's red or blue didn't reply got a couple other things um we're doing battery relocation video next week um going to get that going and I'll show you guys what I need for that as well and what I've got for it so we're going to open this up see it's already sealed I have no idea please be red oh thank God that's red okay so I just tore this open so I can hold the camera um these all the hoses that are order

(Start: 00:01:02)
I think I paid about 700 or so um about $50 they look pretty decent I was going to go for Autobon 88 um prices were a bit expensive and I was also needing a new clutch so I just went ahead and got these guys there's a couple pieces in here let's see what we got obviously I don't know what they all do um where they go I'll kind of marry it up when it's time to fit it see there's a cat more and one more sorry this with one hand I'm still waiting for my tripod to arrive and my microphone that's taking forever next time I'm going to buy lo I

(Start: 00:02:04)
see it came with a bunch of clamps I'm not going to use these I've got some decent SE BS all different sizes okay so here's what we got okay I know this one is for the top of the radiator I know that much the rest I have no idea um I'll put the link in the description for this so it's about $50 um including shipping from China and they look okay hopefully they'll foot it out I'm going to do this probably in about 2 or 3 weeks time um it says performance parts G+ 1 2 3 4 5 six seven pieces okay so the next thing that I'm going to do um is going to be battery relocation from the front of the car to the rear obviously the R32 GTR had the battery in the front and the engine um r33 R34 they all had them in the boot so I'm going to be moving it to the rear

(Start: 00:03:05)
of the car for two reasons one being weight distribution so I've lighten the rear of the car I haven't done much about the front so I'm going to be moving that to the back two I am going to be reclaiming some space in the engine bay so that's a big thing for me I want to tidy up neaten up the engine bay battery is taking up a hell of a lot of space we can put an oil relocation oil filter relocation kit there in its place we can put a couple of things in there so I just want some more space so I can work so this is what you're going to need you're going to need a battery box this was 100 round um about $8 um basic there's no lid or anything I am going to do a custom lid I'm going to do something in PCS with some latches on the side so I just I particularly wanted this box okay so I just got some cable ties cuz I ran out uh battery terminals nothing special about these they're not quick release or anything they're just normal ones they about $3 35 then the kit came with some straps

(Start: 00:04:08)
probably won't use these to tie this whole thing down most important one is the fuse 150 amp fuse uh you can use 150 or 200 150 should be sufficient and then your zero gauge cable or wire okay so what is going to happen is you're going to have this fuse so lid comes off and on one of these terminals here you're going to be wiring that in there so it should essentially be like that and on this side will be your positive that's currently sitting in your battery in the front the terminal is going to be taken off there and it's going to be wide up into that side um this side's going to connect there this long end that's going to going to go back into the boot of the car and I'll show you guys exactly how to do that in the video and that's going to connect to the battery grounding I'll show you what to do in the video um but we're going to

(Start: 00:05:08)
ground to the chassis and that's about it um so I've got all the parts uh I'm I'm just missing a couple things in terms of Bolts Etc so I'm bus getting everything together and I'm going to be doing this in the next couple days first we battery relocation I'll show you guys exactly how to how to do that also how to get through the firewall and get this nostic cable through the firewall um I know it's been challenging for some I know you guys have requested it a couple times um after that we're going to be doing this installing these radiator hoses and that'll be on a separate video there after there'll be a couple other small things that need to go and finally the clutch will be done guys um that's about a quick update for me um you will have a video in the next few days guys thanks a lot for the support really appreciate it just keep the channel going like comment subscribe I really appreciate all the subscribers recently thanks very much guys keep it

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys a little bit of a different video today um I went out and I bought two Canon sx610 cameras yesterday one is for vlogging one is for my wife so I figured you guys need or dessert rather some better content better quality videos um I'm Vlogging off my phone still iPhone 5c piece of um I'm about to show you the cameras we decided to open them yesterday I was going to do an unboxing video I kind of forgot so I've packaged the one away as best as I can so I'm going to switch over to the Vlog cam let me know what you guys think in the comments okay we are now on the Vlog cam so this is a Canon SX 610 HS it looked like one of the better ones at the shop for our price range and it's pretty decent let's go to Wi-Fi

(Start: 00:01:00)
it's got a whole bunch of other stuff I'll show you the other camera now so you can actually get a feel for it but I just sick and tired of using the phone figured you guys need a better content so I bought this so let me show you my little GTR collection I used to have a ton of Auto Art models um they're all Subaru's Subarus one is to 18 24 32 I had tons of them um sold them all when I sold my scoops and never bought them again so I've started buying Kyosho models and auto Arc models again and a couple of the random ones so this is R32 GTR just looks like a standard model on it opens steering moves seats move

(Start: 00:02:02)
boot opens how's the camera's set to Auto so autofocus what's everything um I'm not good at the stuff uh so her food comes out okay looks alright on the display uh this is a random model I just got off eBay or 32 GTR R35 I found someone else walking past this is the Auto Art monitor 18 um this has been thrown on the floor prior to having them on the display cabinet uh cats decided to play with it okay this one's got a little engines down here sorry bonnet's dead you can see the Auto Art model is

(Start: 00:03:03)
quite a bit more detailed in the car show this is a v-spec 2. expensive model nice to have okay so these models over here um some tummy I want us to 24 I started building that one I've got a super I started building um R35 cheap model someone gave it to me I don't remember who I think was my dad that's one of these burrago ones oh first one ever I don't really collect these but it's here then this one was given to me by a car salesman when he bought our Nissan Juke um this was actually the normal Nissan Juke that we bought not the current but not Edition that

(Start: 00:04:05)
we've got at the moment then I started collecting these little models now guys this is a fairly new collection like I said I used to have over 20 or 30 Subarus before um so I need to build up on this collection this is an RX7 and I don't know if you guys have seen these but it's this Wonder collection this used to come in coffee tin so if you can read the top it's this Wonder a wonderful coffee Mazda speed so it turns out in Japan used to get these in your coffee tins much like we get toys in our cereal boxes they got awesome JDM Cars in there coffee so that's an RX7 does an R32 GTR

(Start: 00:05:09)
and This Is R34 okay let me show you the guys the camera now okay here's the box of the camera like I said we got a little bit too excited we started opening up both the boxes so I'm currently on my 16 at the moment uh this one is my wife's one so kind of unboxing we try to put everything back to how it was so as you can see it comes with all warranty cards Etc manual this is about oh sorry I'm trying to get used to the camera I didn't realize you're out of the shot um there's about 10 pages in English the

(Start: 00:06:10)
rest is in um Italian Hungary Hungarian French blah blah blah Portuguese Etc so it's about 10 pages in English the quick start card relatively useless uh cardboard piece under that you've got your charging cable I think it's this African one you guys would probably have something different if you're watching from overseas that is the connection if you can see it then you've got the little charger thingy so that's where your battery goes so the battery will hook onto here and there's a charging port pretty standard port this is a 4.2 volt and 0.7 amp output okay camera itself obviously the battery goes

(Start: 00:07:12)
over here and when you unbox it and there's also a little doohickey strap so you don't drop it that was also on the side okay I'm just gonna put my camera down for a second take this off okay guys here's the camera s6610 HS lastly weighted uh I think it's just under 200 grams it's got a pop-up flash on it to activate the pop-up Flash oops sorry battling here a little bit so there's a little switch on the side you hit the switch Flash doesn't pop up there we go it goes down switch the camera on on button over here lens shoots out there's a display

(Start: 00:08:12)
okay so on the camera you have a whole bunch of buttons there um I kind of just sit man to the Top Mode some Auto hybrid auto mode that's what it's currently on right now you can put on manually you can do a whole bunch of stuff with it I don't know how to work it I don't really care um I'll probably figure it out another time but for now I just want to Vlog get some content out to you guys um display is quite decent I don't know what size it is uh but there's a little play button here you can hit that need playback old photos Etc a picture of our baby room so you can see the photo quality is very good decent recorders obviously what we're doing right now video recording you can adjust the flash display um those cameras go to wireless as well so I've already been playing it I've logged in with my phone and you can zoom in out you can take photos you can record video Etc so you just need to tap those

(Start: 00:09:13)
telephone button here or cell phone button it searches for access points so what it does it broadcasts from this device it'll broadcast SSID you'll then connect with your cell phone to your cssid there's no pass key for it you connect you'll open up your camera connect software sync it with this device put device will Insight okay it's picked up Bob's iPhone or whatever it may be and you click yes pay once it's paired you can then control the phone so we're not going to do that now let's show you some recording okay so on the zoom side of things you've got this little thing at the top and when you pull that you'll see the lens actually comes out

(Start: 00:10:13)
so it does 18 times optical zoom and then 36 times the jaw it's a pretty decent fc1 something it's quite close though okay so that's your limits on sorry guys I'm very classy anyway what I'm going to do now is we're going to go up another Excursion and I'm gonna take the camera with uh we're gonna video do a couple fun things and I'll show you to open the Vlog so guys with regards to car vlogging um I mean obviously be doing this on a weekly basis um all GTR related content um mostly how-to guards working on the car getting it up to race days Etc so most of you saw that I broke the clutch I'm getting that sorted out it's gonna take three to four weeks for it to arrive um I might be doing a bunch of work in the interim I won't be vlogging all of

(Start: 00:11:13)
it October once the clutch is in fill it done I'm gonna get the car out and Diner again uh last time it was 404 horsepower that was before a lot of the mods so let's see what we can do now quite excited for that also it's a stock twin server setup stock turbos and those with ceramic blades so I want to see how far I can push those um other news is I've got another Vlog sorry I've got another car camera so it's a transcend car camera I forgot the name of it but it does a whole lot of cool stuff that's going to be a dash cam that I'm going to set up so I'm going to take you guys with on a little Tropics Excursion I'm going to use it now you guys are going to see a little time lapse in the next couple of minutes and we're gonna go off on a little Mission and also showcase this Canon sx610 guys thanks very much for watching and really appreciate all the subscribers it's been calming very quickly um I think I was on about 25 subscribers

Title: Project R32 GTR - Broken Car Update And Debadging
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRAE4YsXPbY

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys so today is more of an update video most of you know that I broke the car last week and I managed to head out to the races got out did all my prereqs in the car managed to get everything ready and running check the call I was there I was meticulous about every single thing and got on the drag strip dialed it up to 5/8 plus minus and

(Start: 00:01:00)
yeah clutch slipped first gear I wasn't very good sick and yeah the clutch slip the whole way if they'd get bets a little bit changing to fourth and I had some power it saw me a 13-6 across the line at 131 kilometers an hour just really slowly Gaza were doing 13 5 13 sixes on the day they were going through it about 170 165 to about 175 so you can see the speed difference my 60 foot was one point man average I was happy for about a 1.7 it wasn't my first attempt ty pressures weren't exactly what I wanted them to be I was gonna drop it gradually during the day just to see what it could do

(Start: 00:02:01)
I wasn't a vlog the whole thing but I kind of got everyone off to breaking a car understandably I start off high pressures to bar in the rear to point one in the front I was gonna drop it down point one every run guys were seeing roughly five to six runs for the other for the day I've tried doing the second attempt couldn't even get off the line properties' park the car off drive back home yes I did not put the corner trailer I drove it back home close okay still driving if I try and do hard acceleration in first gear the cluster slips second gear cuff slurps third gear any rpm the cars actually fun so Garrett is a mess car is filthy it's got all the dust from the track the race strip is in the middle of the bush so it gets super dusty there I need to wash the car so

(Start: 00:03:02)
today is more of an update what I'm going to be doing is are we cleaning up my garage it is filthy I kind of just three things in here after the race there and also during the prep so quick update and what I'm gonna be doing today is keen update for me I'm going to clean up the garage and clean the car I'm gonna be bad to the back but I wanted to say listen anymore I just want the GTR badge on there so I'm gonna show you guys how to do that in a minute um another thing after that launch the grommet shut off on the radio so you see it's supposed to have one of these that's shut off after my first run so I've just typed it up and put some cable ties and I've ordered a new grommet and it actually might be underneath the motor where the engine trays are but I'm not going to get digging around for that but I'll just order another one for dear father's in the future keep it as a spare plans or as GIGN

(Start: 00:04:08)
clutch or ass-kickin it's the r3c clutch it's roughly 31,000 round excluding vet Safra Catz 14% that's its maths is bad 34,000 around plus/minus that's just for the clutch plus there's labour then you got to buy a kit that does the push to pull top conversion so that's quite a bit of money I'm playing on hold for now I'm probably an order in about a week maybe two weeks I want to do a little bit of a pasta so I'm going to borrow a bunch of stuff and do everything at once I've got a couple things on the way should be here within the week I'm replacing all my radiator hoses as you see over here they now old this one's cut up and Heather ordered 10% so which I've pulled out I'm just waiting for the new ones to come in so anything that hose related

(Start: 00:05:12)
I'm replacing I'll show you a screenshot right now that's what I'm getting I'm getting a couple things to help vlog a little bit bit us gorillas stand little tripod lapel microphone and we're gonna be buying a vlog camera so I can do this stuff property a couple of things just to help out so because I'm enjoying vlogging I never thought I would say this it's kind of more like a point of view for my massage but I'm enjoying this so I'm gonna continue these weekly updates and they see how far we can go the cost I'm going to spin it around now overseas nice place in the garage and I want to take up the missing badge I'll show you guys how to do that so this is the missing badge that I'm gonna be taking off now and there's all the dust and sand and mud at the Corporal home with it so so

(Start: 00:06:14)
that means to be keen but what you need is your wife's hair dryer so any drawing all day or a heat gun I don't recommend that though because it might get a little bit too hot and you don't need some dental floss right so grab some dental floss and your heat gun or your wife's hair dryer you gonna want to sit your hairdryer on to the hottest city and you're going to heat the six not for about a minute now you don't want to even leave it Rembrandt off-screen a little family trip and the key part to the movie

(Start: 00:07:17)
okay so you gonna grab your dental floss and you take both hands and you're gonna hook it between here and you're just gonna pull no I don't have a tripod it's I'm gonna have to go at the off cam so because there was literally five seconds after I switch the cam off it just kind of glided through here pulled it off nice and easy there's still quite a bit of residue on here and hopefully so Anya stop cleaning that up so most partners need a respray in my opinion or at least if it does you can see it is a crack on here a little bit of issues on the wing Oh everything else is fun I just need to get the booty spread wing resprayed as well okay so I'm gonna start the clean up now so there you've seen good polish I'm gonna walk it down Erskine green I'm not sure if you guys have got the services but I'm gonna spray this on should take off mostly residue and we have to rub with microfiber cloth mustard should come off

(Start: 00:08:18)
then I'm just gonna do a live polish on the car okay so I managed to get the logo off a little bit first off I'm sure you can see looks like whoever owned this car in Japan decided to respray the car with the badge on so you can see there's two different shades of silver so I am gonna sing this in for a spray that's confirmed so what turned out to be an easy cleanup of a not just relax I'm now pissed off anyway moving on I'm gonna clean up the garage I'm gonna do a couple things guys I'll be vlogging again next week

(Start: 00:09:20)
I've got a few plans while we're waiting for the clutch I would obviously order it it's gonna take I think it was three to four weeks arrived in the interim I'm gonna be doing a couple of videos so one is I'm gonna be relocating the battery you want to take that from the front I wanna move it to the boot obviously make some brackets get it fixed down nasty that's one of the things I want to do and uh oh you guys are 1 80 kph speed limiter remover I'm definitely gonna be doing that there's a few bits and bobs might be taking listen for respray sooner than later we'll see how it goes girls as always thanks very much like comment subscribe thanks again for the support

Title: Project R32 GTR - Drag Preperation Part 2
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFiIvU_ENVw

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] e [Music] what's up guys Nelson here welcome to drag prep part two so in this episode I'm going to show you guys a couple things more preparation based getting yourself ready for the event itself

(Start: 00:01:01)
now last week I touched on a couple things like speed airflow suspension tire pressure weight reduction this week we're going to look at a couple things so the first thing we're going to look at is race fuel obviously these cars were tuned on 98 in Japan um I do have a M's ECU I know absolutely nothing about it don't know what it's tuned on to be safe I run NF Ultra this is octane booster in South Africa we got pretty poor fuel qualities we got 93 we got 95 octane it's not like the 93 or 91 of the states the 91 of the states is more like a 98 that we used to get here in South Africa so if I run 95 straight on the car I can feel it hesitating it's pinging it's deting knocking I'm pretty sure all of the above I run octane booster just to be safe this particular brand of octane booster I found works the best in the car I know a lot of people don't recommend using it as a daily um 10 booster as it fils plugs

(Start: 00:02:02)
however I've done roughly 6,000 Cas since I've bought the car um I've already changed plugs once I'll probably do it again as needed now this octane booster you can run different mixes so six run if you guys can see there to get six run you would mix one lit of this now this is a 1 lit container You' mix one lit with 50 to 60 L of petrol now I don't want six run when I'm racing I want 10 run when I'm racing so that'll roughly bring it up to about 105 octane um what I'm going to do is I'm going to premix this just now I'll show you in the video I need to go pick up a container I'm going to fill it with an 95 fuel I'm going to mix 20 L with 1 L of this NF Ultra so that should bring it up to about 105 octane I already have some in the tank at the moment so I'm going to drive there I've worked out my mileage are roughly due 17 to 20 L to 100 km I'm going to be

(Start: 00:03:05)
driving a bit slower um should see better fuel consumption I've guesstimated by the time I reach there I should have roughly 5 L it should just kick into Reserve before I get there it's about 110 km from where I live um to be safe I am going to take another container with extra fuel so if I do run out halfway or close by I'll just top it up but essentially I want to run this with 20 L on the drag strip 105 octane or as close as I know you guys might say okay well it's not going to give you 105 technically not correct Etc and I really don't care as long as it is the most powerful mix let's see how it does so the next thing you need to make sure of is maintenance is everything okay in terms of fluids oils Etc I just recently had the car serviced uh buddy of mine helped me out with that everything's done um I have just gone

(Start: 00:04:06)
through and I've checked do I have water in all the tanks um obviously radiator fluid Etc um oils my oils topped up anything that takes a fluid is it okay has it needs to be changed Etc gearbox oil diff oil just done so everything is fine we're ready to rock and roll with this so I'm going to take a little toolbox with bunch of tools I just started throwing stuff in here um hammers q20 silicon spray standing knives assortment of spanners uh I've got a ratchet set inside here cable tires more screwdrivers duct tape insulation tape Etc anything that I possibly could need for small fixes obviously if something big breaks box clutch cars going on a trailer it's going back home I've had the unfortunate news of not being able to use a trailer so I'm going to drive up to the event and I'm going to

(Start: 00:05:08)
hopefully drive back and not be in the back of a flatbed or a trailer let's see how that goes the other thing I'm going to take with is a couple fluids so I'm going to take extra water across with me um I'm going to take engine oil make sure that gets across there so just in case I need a top up I'm going to take a spray bottle with me and I'm going to take ice water so I'm going to fill the spray bottle with ice water I'm going to be spraying the intercooler and making sure that is nice and cool for every run that I do right guys uh let's go for a drive we're going to go do tire pressure we're going to make sure tire pressure is right for me to drive there soon as I get there I'm going to be dropping the tire pressure as per my previous video um one thing I'm going to not be able to do today is the 180k D limiter I will make a separate video for you guys I'm going to do that tomorrow night possibly Friday it will be done before the event just in case I hit that 180 limiter um

(Start: 00:06:11)
so I'll show you in a separate video how to do that very easy from what I understand um other things I'm going to do in the gar tonight after the tire pressure I'm going to throw my battery charger on caruse just been for a wash well I wash it myself rather very quick one um throw the battery charger on put the car cover on make sure the car is nice and clean before it gets to the event nothing worse than having a dirty car at a race day especially a car that people don't see on a daily basis guys let's go for a drive guys hopefully you can hear me okay I'm trying something new with the camera uh little bit shaky got a new stand for it um seems to be holding up okay Noe it's pretty shaky all right as you can see our roads are pretty stuffed um we've had severe

(Start: 00:07:13)
storms we I live in Pula Nel Urban we've had flooding we've had all sorts of stuff happen here there's even a tornado in so quite hectic stuff anyway I've started buying some things just to hopefully make the video quality be be a bit better um in terms of audio I bought a lapel microphone I'm waiting for it to arrive uh I've got a tripod that's on the way so I can start doing some decent shots um and then obviously this mount for the car but it seems to be a little bit choppy I'm actually holding it so it doesn't vibrate so much so I may cut this video short anyway I am driving driv off to put some fuel car is still cold so I can't do anything I'm going to put fuel I'm going to do tire pressure hey guys so this is about an

(Start: 00:08:13)
hour later after I cut the video off just now for shaky cam I've been to four petrol stations so far two have run out of fuel one there were about 30 cars and the other one the queue is too long so I've got to get back home I got to have dinner with my wife I'm going to try again a little bit later found out that there is a petol strike happening tomorrow so everyone's trying to fill up I don't have fuel in the car yet I haven't filled up well I do have a bit of fuel in the car but not enough to get to the event I need to fill up my containers with my Race Fuel and Patrol one sec see the roads are still bad here so I've been doing loops around uh I can't go too far there wasn't going to waste too much fuel going to try a bit later see if I can get some petrol at another one of these petrol stations so I've just arrived back home back in the garage um like I've said

(Start: 00:09:14)
there's a fuel struck to tried four petrol stations can't get in right now I don't want a chance driving the car um I'm going to switch to my juke I'm going to pick up my containers I'm going to fill them up I'm going to fill up my juke and carry on what's up guys so now I am in my n Juke it is a 2013 dig t uh 1.6 turbo midnight Edition just high of 200 horsepower fun to drive uh cool little car border for my wife actually um but most of you know she's pregnant so I'm driving it I'm going to get another da for myself um I am on the hunt for some fuel going to drive past a couple petrol stations see what's going on I suspect that they are still going to be full so we are coming up to one in a few

(Start: 00:10:25)
seconds right here has an engine I drove past this one a little bit earlier they were full and it looks like it's subsided now so I'm going to pick up the containers I'm going to come back and I'm going to hit that petrol station so I got my containers uh here's another petrol station I'm not going to go to this one uh but you guys can see the cues there's whole lot of cars waiting to get in so I'm going to go back to the one I saw that was relatively empty let's hope we've got some fuel I found out what the cause of this is um turns out there's petrochemical companies that are going on strike or at least the workers are going on strike roughly 23,000 of them it's not the petrol attendants themselves it's going to be the suppliers they're looking for a 9% wage increase hopefully they get it uh it's

(Start: 00:11:25)
going to make a race there very difficult to get to especially like I said earlier I don't have a trailer so let's see what I can do um I'll got my containers I'm going to go fill them up now hey guys so I just drive back home um my fuel hunt was semis successful I went past those petrol stations where I thought they it was empty they were empty but they had no fuel only a diesel so didn't help out to go to the other end of town managed to find a dodgy petrol station not going to mention any names I don't fill up with this brand I don't like it um I've managed to get two 25 L drums and reading the news but um I'm going to have to make a serious decision now about whether or not I'm going to partake in the race with my R32 GTR or even go to the race for that matter um I've got a 7mon pregnant wife

(Start: 00:12:26)
I got to worry about um I don't how long this fuel strike is going to run for um I got to make sure we got enough fuel at home in case I need to get it to the hospital or the doctors Etc um so let's just hope that this fuel strike comes to an end um I'm I'm pretty worried um I'm going to carry on as per normal until Saturday Saturday I'll make my decision um let's hope for the best guys uh let's see what we can do anyway a bit of a morbid end the video um um guys thanks for watching subscribe if you like it um like it and comment thanks very much guys cheers bye

Title: Project R32 GTR - Drag Race Preperation Part 1
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ctxvEJcT7s

(Start: 00:00:00)
so I want to talk to you guys a bit about drags and what I'm going to do to try and better that time obviously I have done some mods since then um most of you guys have followed I've done the Boost controller down PS full exhaust um intake Etc there's a rather large gry trust [Music] intercooler what's up guys Nelson here so I'm doing something a bit different today um as the title says it's drag prep part one next week's Sunday I'm participating in a drag or quarter mile event I haven't done one of these for about three years plus minus um basically got the car moved to a city called Johannesburg um went through to odr ran a couple times nothing impressive the castal running on 0.7 bar with the

(Start: 00:01:01)
restrictor pull in it um no mods other than a catback exhaust ran a 131 launching like a noob I was basically holding the clutch full in holding the revs dumping the clutch bogging managed to get one off the line [Music] decently most of you know I've generally been in the saari game or Subaru game um I've had nine scubs before my first GTR um not my first nen I didn't want to break it at that time so I was launching terribly I didn't want to do anything to the car um it's taken me 3 years to actually start working on the car um couple bits and Bobs here and there now I want a bit of these times I quite a bit I want to possibly break into the

(Start: 00:02:02)
11s there are guys that have ran run 114s 115s um some very impressive videos out there from Ben s on YouTube I'm going to link him in the description um there should be a card that will pop up on your screen now Ben ran his stock twin turbo setup 118 in Australia very impressive he's been giving me a couple tips so big UPS to Ben I'm just going to discuss a couple things and hopefully this will help someone better their times I'm going to put it to the test next week Sunday so let's see how it goes so the first thing I want to talk about is weight removal or reduction um it's a big thing on the cars um these aren't the lest of cars I've tried to shred down as much weight as possible by removing a whole host of items and I'm going to take you around back garage so you guys know that I removed

(Start: 00:03:02)
my rear seats um I have gone a little bit further and I started pulling out a little bit more than that so hopefully you can see generally do most of the work at night as I'm rather busy during the day so rear speakers are out Claren amplifier is out finally um Matt is out underneath the mat sorry it's over here there's a cardboard um that's out rear seats are out um this is the back where the speakers are and a couple other bits and Bobs I can't take my torch around as it's plugged into the car but you get the idea so this is what the rear of the car looks like I am going to pull the spare wheel out and the Jack out on the day this is how the car is going to sit permanently um I don't use the back seats at

(Start: 00:04:04)
all it's my weekend warrior I'll be tracking the car there's absolutely no need for me to have any trim so I've pulled off all the plastic bits that surround everything carpets mats Etc and you can see right through into the cabin okay so let me take you back inside so this is the rear pretty simple job to do it's taken about 40 minutes um obviously reassembling would take a whole of a lot longer the hardest part was to get the speakers out ready you just need the right set of tools it's number eight socket um I to use a spanner and different types of screwdrivers managed to pop them out um I'm probably going to put that plastic piece back over here where I'm showing the torch just so it'll look a little bit

(Start: 00:05:05)
cooler um obviously on the day I'm going to leave it off I have no idea how much any of this stuff weighs um I am going to do a away in probably in the next two weeks or so um I'll let you guys know how much I've managed to sh off by doing that um yeah so that's weight reduction in a nutshell obviously you can go a little bit th than I've gone um a lot of guys pull out airon condensers the heater Matrix quite a few things I don't want to touch any of that just yet I don't have time at the moment I do want to do it um this is going to be a dedicated weekend car and track car I I do have another daily driver um what guys generally do is they go all out they pull out ceiling mats um they pull out sun visors heater Matrix

(Start: 00:06:05)
the Hass is roughly 60 kilos on its own um I've still got the ha house on my car so I'm basically pulling out what I can reach and what's easy for me to do right now with the limited amount of time so in nutshell that's weight reduction so next item I want to talk about is tire pressure um obviously better branding of tires would help um I'm currently running Federal rsr 595 um I've been told best to run them at roughly 25 26 PSI on the rear so that'll be roughly about 1.6 to 1.7 bar um I am going to run the front probably two bar between 1.9 and two bar that's 28 29 PSI see what it'll do um obviously with the lower tire pressure on the rear the tires will appear to be wider on the road um

(Start: 00:07:05)
I'm not entirely sure on the entire concept of it you can Google it just figure it out but um obviously there'll be more surface if there's lower tire pressure the tire will kind of widen itself out um and I'll get more grip and we should be able to launch quite nicely so that's tires uh pretty straight forwards um I'm driving the car to the track I'm not trailing it so so I'm going to run tire pressure as per normal 2.4 2.5 bar just before I get there I'm going to drop tie presses and go from there next is suspension so in terms of suspension I'm going to leave the front I've got the Tain coilovers um I'm going to leave the front medium to hard there are little adjustment knobs on the top so these click every time you adjust them if you can hear that now these adjustment knobs will

(Start: 00:08:06)
obviously to the left make it softer to the right harder I'm going to zero everything out and I'm going to go relatively soft in the back and medium hard in the front the theory or the concept on this is when you launch the back of the car is going to hunker itself down the front's going to lift and hopefully you're going to take off like a rocket I haven't tried this yet when I ran I ran full hard setup the car was horrible to drive so to say the least um like I said I just got the car I didn't want to Tinker too much to see what it does so I'm going all out on the suspension side of thing uh wheel alignment um you can go a standard setup obviously don't go full negative track setup um slightly positive is fine slightly negative is even okay obviously I need to get the car

(Start: 00:09:07)
running nasty most of you have seen out seen the other video that I had um boosting the car's driving pretty well for a stock turo setup picking up speed very quickly however I'm going to attempt to run a scramble boost for a little while um possibly 5 seconds or so I'm going to attempt doing it in third or fourth if you don't know what scramble boost is it's a setting on the Boost controller that will allow you to get more boost for a couple of seconds so you can decide on how many seconds you want additional boost I'll show you now so here's a familiar face um click the the mod M once that's going to take you to your first option of scramble boost now remember in my other video this is percentage based so you would set up

(Start: 00:10:07)
your Boost how you want it if you want to hit your scramble boost you're going to change your percentage wi so let's say I want an extra 10 from what it currently is I'm going select 10 and I'll push mod again mod is going to say how many seconds I want us to boost higher for so I'm going to choose 5 seconds or 6 seconds I'm going to probably go for about 5 seconds on the day that's all you need to do really once you boost thing I might use this and I might use it in third gear more than likely third gear when I'm boosting and I don't have to change gears I will hold down the scramble boost button that's scrambling now so 6 5 4 3 2 1 you would have had high boost at that moment I'm not sure if I'm going to use it um I might do one fun run with it see what we can do um I am aware that these are ceramic turbos um hopefully they don't themselves let's see what happens um

(Start: 00:11:09)
that's power out of the way now the next one is also speed related um I highly doubt I'm going to go over 189 K per hour but as most of you guys know uh these cars have got a governor 180 K an hour um very irritating and rather embarrassing for me um when I did race for the first time I did the 400 M4 Mile and I did a 1 km stretch when we did that I thought I was going to be 230 240 k um no every pass 189 K an hour very embarrassing um I will do a separate video show you guys how to remove that 180k per hour limiter okay and the last one is obviously trying to get cool air to the car now I've got these HKS filters in here um when the bonnet's down there's

(Start: 00:12:11)
kind of no way for air to get in here other than this tiny duck that's somewhere underneath here um what I'm going to do for the event I am going to remove my headlight and I'm going to make some sort of a mesh cover for it so that is one thing I'm do there going to be a separate video as well um obviously you guys know about charal canister I've been me need to take that out for a long time now that is going to come out next Wednesday too um once everything's out I'm pretty much ready to go I'm really hoping to break into the 11s um let's see how it goes so guys once again thanks very much uh looking forward to you guys coming back next week watching part two like comment subscribe if you guys have got any advice please let me know um I'm new to this I'm I am an amateur um I'm new to these type of cars like I said I've always been the Subaru family let me

(Start: 00:13:11)
know um I'm open to any suggestions and guys big shout out to Ben again he's been great help um see you guys next week thanks

Title: HKS EVC Boost Controller Setup
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdBP5eaXT0o

(Start: 00:00:00)
bring [Music] it what's up guys Nelson here first of all just like to thank everyone for liking commenting subscribing really appreciate it it's been a real inspiration so last week I filmed a how to install the HKS EVC boost controller this week I'd like to show you guys how to set it up so the first thing is you need to establish are you running internal waste gate are you running external waste Gates and how are you going to set this up so if you're running an external waste goat you're going to set the Boost controller up to a poppet valve type or PO on these boost controllers if it's a swing type it's going to be an s on here so the way you're going to set this up is on the back of the control unit pull this off you can see there's a little switch there in the corner so that is your s SW

(Start: 00:01:01)
and your P swing top internal waste gate P external waste gate how you going to set this up you're going to switch the ignition on bruise control will come on and now to set it up you're actually going to have to look at your screen so if you have the screen for this unit which is over here you're now going to switch ignition and you will see an s or a p o at the top there where it says 105 the S has just gone away I'll show you guys again there we go there's an S at the top so now that is set to external uh sorry to internal on my side now the way I got that set up is you will then you'll first turn your

(Start: 00:02:02)
Boost controller off by holding in the power button boost controls show Green now on these boost controllers quite strange green means not in use or off red means in use or on so you'll have it in Green in off mode you'll then pull it out while you're flipping it from s SW to PO or vice versa you're going to be holding holding on your power button so while you're doing that you're going to flip the switch while holding it you need to hold it for at least 3 seconds on the Boost controller itself on the screen for it it is then going to flick between s or p on the screen now that is how you set up your actuator on here if you don't have the screen all you need to do is just flip the switch on the back of the unit and the unit will then know is it external W SC is it internal WK Etc and so for me I've got stock turbos and running my internal actuators so I'm set

(Start: 00:03:05)
to internal waste goat now what you see at the bottom where it says zero that is the current boost pressure so obviously the car is off at the moment when you switch the car on it's going to pull vacuum you're going to see negative pressure when I accelerate go on to boost it's going to go positive the 152 above that is the previous boost or the previous highest recorded boost that I hit I did say to you guys in the last video that I had a leak I then hit 1.5 bar that is my 1.5 bar it is currently showing in PSR so 152 that is 1.5 bar roughly um how are you going to set this up is you are going to need to get a base so to get your base you need to get onto a closed Road a highway Etc and you're going to go into a gear where there is load so on five 5speed I would

(Start: 00:04:05)
recommend going third gear six speeed I recommend going in fourth gear and you're going to go wide open throttle to almost end of your RPM range so once you get that your Boost controller where the 152 is on mine it is then going to show you your actuator boost so initially mine when I first set it up it hit uh I think it was 55 plus minus which is essentially 05 of a bar now that was my actuat pressure from there you will then add more in percentage to apply more boost so what I've done is I got my base which is5 bar then I've gone to this boost controller now while it's on as I said as I mentioned previously red is on green is off so currently it's set to a volume and B volume a volume is currently the Boost that I'm set

(Start: 00:05:06)
to I'm not going to mess around my Boost settings on my a volume so to flick between the two settings you can push select once now you see B has gone red that means it's currently in use now what you'll do is to tune it or to add more boost you'll push out the dial the dial pops out and you'll just turn the knob to add more boost now I'm going to show you on the display unit there are slight little increments on here uh obviously the display unit is more accurate and it's got more options when you're looking at the display unit you'll see the zero that's where you'll be adding boost it now Chang it to percentage so those numbers that's me turning it on the boost control side it goes up by 2% every time so if I flip back to my a volume and you can see in the top left corner there it's flipped to a so I'll flip back to B back to a you can

(Start: 00:06:08)
see I have added 38 so that's a percentage so for me to make one bar I've then added 38% and that's made my one bar right let's stick on the B settings I don't mess anything up or at least mess my settings up I'm going to show you guys some of the things that this boost controller has got it is an older one um a lot of people call the HKS EVC 5 once you add the display its official name without the display is HKS EVC ez2 so I'm going to show you how to set this up mode at the top or mod that allows you to cycle through settings select is to cycle up and change settings SBC is your scramble boost setting now I'll get into that just now and and here's another power button so you can use this power button instead of the other control unit at the bottom if you really want to so at the moment this is more of a display mode the zero shows your

(Start: 00:07:09)
current boost so if I start the car it'll go up and down currently showing zero I'm going to go through the modes now so mode one option one is your scrambled boost what scrambled boost is you can set a percentage higher on top of your base so if you decide that your base is now going to be one bar and you you've configured it for one bar there's something called scramble boost where you can give it maybe 5% Etc so you can make it 1.2 bar for 10 seconds so if you really want to overtake someone or you want to have a quick race on someone you want extra boost you're going to set up your scrambled in a percentage so let's say 10% would give you and I'm just saying I'm not sure what it would be 10% would give you 0.1 of a bar if that was the case you set that to 10% and when you hit scramble boost and the way to set it

(Start: 00:08:10)
up to hit scramble boost is to hold on SBC it will give you 1.1 bar for 5 10 seconds whatever you set it to so let's set it 10% let's say in theory it'll give you 1.1 bar you're going to go to mode and now this is option two that we're on here option two and you'll see on the right hand side bottom right that's how many seconds so 5 Seconds that's how long your scramble boost will last for so I'm going to set my Scramble boost for 4 seconds you see I was using the select button and that's the down button so we're going to go 4 seconds and I'm going to go back to the display now so let's say I'm racing someone and I just need a little bit extra kick I'm going to hold down my Scramble boost see there's a countdown at the top 4 3 2 1 bang so that gave me 1.1 bar instead of of my usual one bar that's your scramble boost obviously make sure your car is tuned to handle that extra boost I would not do it on this car with ceramic stock turbos I'm hitting one bar and I'm

(Start: 00:09:11)
staying at one bar option three is your warning so once I've achieved my one bar I want to set up a warning so I've set mine up for 1.05 bar essentially so if I hit just over one bar and I hit let's say 1.06 bar the Boost controller will be plucked crazy tell me to lay off the Boost Etc so it's a nice thing like I had the other day when I had a broken te piece or pop um it shot to 1.5 this warned me which was very nice I would have seen it anyway I would I did feel it but this would have worn me and would have beeped the next couple of steps so if you push mod again it's going to take me back to the home screen only allows me to go through 1 2 3 back to the home screen there is some secret options some people call them forums you're going to hold mod down that takes you to option four now option four is your display type so it's

(Start: 00:10:12)
your basically your graph how high do you want to show it so you can go all the way up I think 250 so it just makes your graph bigger or smaller you obviously don't want to see that much data so I've set mine to 1.55 bar so my graph will show 1.55 bar that's as big as it will go next option five this is your backlight brightness one is slightly damaged so you can see it doesn't get too much brighter than 100% And 100% is quite DM during the day um but that is your backl brightness next this is your security lock so I can set a code in here stop someone from accessing it if you want to go to a Val we you don't trust the mechanic you can set your Boost down to actuator and you can put a lock code on this they won't be able to adjust it there is an option seven on some later units I don't have it on mine unfortunately I really wish I did it's something called an offset option the

(Start: 00:11:14)
offset option allows you to manipulate the speed that your wastegate opens and closes which essentially will make your response time quicker on the turbos or Turbo unfortunately I can't do that um if you do have that option you need to know that going backwards so it it starts at 100% when you decrease it it will be on swing top it will be adding more boost to your car in turn you will turn down your boost on your actual controller so you'll turn down your boost on here and you will turn your offset down which will bring it up so if you want still to hit one bar and you turn your offset down and you bring your offset down on here by 10% you might boost to 1.1 so you will turn down the Boost controller itself to re aieve one bar but the offset will

(Start: 00:12:16)
essentially be foster response time it may not be the smoothest or the cleanest on a BRI Groth but it will pick up your response play around with it a lot people use it don't use it I don't have the option I can just control my Boost um it is unfortunate one day I will get a better boost controller for now there's a lot I need to worry about um guys that's pretty much it ask me questions if you need to I've spent a lot of time with this boost control I've got it working nicely I can show you guys how I got it through the firewall I know there's not a lot of info out there on how to get Electronics or wiring through the firewall um it was actually pretty simple um let me know as always like comment subscribe and guys thank you so much for watching really appreciate it just want to let you know I'm going to be uploading videos every Thursday I'm filming the day before give me some ideas if you want to see some cool stuff let me know I can try and do them on Wednesday upload on a Thursday uh next week I will be doing something a

(Start: 00:13:19)
little bit different it is correlated it is GTR related um let me know what you guys think next week once I upload it but thanks again for watching really appreciate it cheers

Title: HKS EVC Boost Controller Installation
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj193A9qHx4

(Start: 00:00:00)
[Music] it what's up guys Nelson here again so I figured I'll show you guys how to install an HKS EVC 5 just recently bought the Boost controller and wanted to install it to my R32 GTR however I found that found that there's not much info on the internet on how to actually fit this uh sat on forums overseas local multiple threads probably over 30 threads lots of contradicting information from people couple diagrams that are hand drawn nothing serious um I am going to show you guys a couple diagrams in this video so stay tuned for that um however I managed to get it in and it's working I want to show you guys how I did it it might not be the best way I'm not a mechanic I do this as a hobby and I just figured I'll show you guys put it online see what you guys

(Start: 00:01:01)
think bear in mind the red cabling that is in here is not 100% I should have 6 mil cables or sorry hoses rather right what we have here is the Boost controller solenoid for the HKS EVC 5 this I've decided to mount on this side pillar so left hand side passenger side right what do we have here this port here this goes off to your actuators so what I've done is I have teed a cable off over here this should be a 6 mil hose it's currently a 4 mil there was no stock I'm waiting for mine to come through before I carry on there should also be two filters two six mil filters one roughly here one roughly about here they say anywhere between 5 and 10 cm you need to put a filter in still waiting for mine I'm going to redo everything so teed off here these need

(Start: 00:02:02)
to go to your actuators so the actuator you can see one over here this one is clearly visible so where the red pop is going that's the one actuator there's obviously a second actuator which sits right under here so follow your stock cables pull those out plug them this is what I've done with mine I've just thrown some bolts on here so put a bit of tubing put a bolt on Blocked It Off that's pretty much all that you need to do on the actuator side those need to come through then obviously get teared off to your boost control solenoid okay the middle one is your boost pressure or your Boost sauce now this is the tricky one on a normal turbocharged car you would generally run your Boost sauce off the nipple on the turbo however this does not have nipples on the turbo so cannot run it off there you have to find your Boost sauce your

(Start: 00:03:03)
Boost sauce sits underneath the plenum right at the back now again excuse the cable or the hose it is rather long it's temporary so if you're going to see it there that is the last nipple and I'll show you on the diagram it's quite tricky to get your hand in here but once you do pull out the original pop it's actually quite easy to slot this one on just put a little bit of silicon on or any sort of lubricant get it in there and that's your Boost Source on the Boost controller the other side is your vacuum you can pull vacuum off the map sensor or you can pull vacuum off vacuum off directly at the back of the block here so what I've done is I've teed here I've got my little uh whatever you call this uh for the boost gauge going into a t piece and then that goes back to the boost control croid that's pretty much it once that's

(Start: 00:04:04)
dialed in um you can customize your Boost give it more give it less I had an issue um check your te pieces I had a faulty te piece from manufacturer it was blocked off on the one side that caused my Boost to sit at roughly 1.5 bar not fun um other than that once you know what you're doing pretty simple I'll put a little bit more in the description of how to do it um and have a look at the pictures pretty straightforward once you figure it out guys thanks again for watching as always like comment and subscribe thanks very much guys one more thing I actually came into the garage with one thing in mind and that was to remove the charcoal canister it pretty much serves no purpose it's got some sort of emission control thing that was put in 25 years ago it not worth keeping I started pulling it out and I got sidetracked I have my buddy here Gareth he's got a 2011 St Str um he came in and we got a

(Start: 00:05:08)
little bit sidetracked and we decided to do that on the rv26 logger I also sprayed cam covers and the top so it looks a hell of lot Neer um charcoal canister will come off pretty soon plus I have a whole lot of more work to do and I will be posting how to videos the next how-to video will be how to set up the HKS EVC 5 get it running on the road on swing top valve thanks guys

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's up guys Nelson here so I thought I'd show you guys my 93 nisson Skyline R32 GT quick overview I've posted a couple videos up nothing special Mostly old videos um decided to do a quick walk around on my R32 so this car landed from Kobe Japan in '93 nothing too crazy has been done on the car um to be honest I haven't really done anything in the last couple months maybe close to a year had some family responsibilities and things I've got a baby on the way which is very exciting um so this is it really this is my GTR it has a kaky motor exhaust it is 90 mil straight pop no cat that meets up with a custom down pop that I had made down pops are 276 miles meeting

(Start: 00:01:00)
into the NY Mill um it is sitting on federal 595s these are 17in tires uh with Buddy Club P1 Racers pretty decent tires uh rims are okay I've actually never heard of Buddy Club until I got this um there are some slotted cross drill discs on the car same with the front I've thrown EBC green stuff pads all around there used to be a lip on the front here that shot off on a highway drive so some really poor Patchwork until I get a new lip the car has a trust intercooler quite a large intercooler front bumper is nisma N1 can see the N1 vents over here in one Lop front Lop

(Start: 00:02:03)
right that is the exterior of the car show you the inside car doesn't need a little bit of a respray uh getting there I've got a couple other things on the list for the time being interior is relatively neat it has the stock seats it's got the stock clusters in um true mileage I have confirmed uh this is the 93 the kuuki I think that's how you pronounce it um made in July 93 has a cold weather package I'm just throwing on that little aftermarket gear stick um it's got a m wheel on it pivot water temp Vincy boost gauge stock cluster on there of course fire extinguisher it has se

(Start: 00:03:05)
belt fivepoint harnesses that I fed the other day um the sound system is pretty much stock just the head unit I know the stock speakers are SL in the car cost has the high cast on it so rear wheel steering um I have fitted a HKS EVC 5 so that has just been fitted recently um I am doing a how-to video for you guys if you can um on how to install it there's not a lot of information online so I have decided to make some videos I'm busy editing at the moment I'm going to throw that on fairly soon um let me show you the engine B there's quite a lot of work that needs to be done on here surprisingly it does look a lot better than what it used to you wouldn't

(Start: 00:04:07)
say so that's it stock bottom end plenum is relatively intact I know a lot of them have got flaky plenums uh it's got the HKS super power flow 63 mil mushroom filters um there's my solenoid for HKS EVC I've removed the stock solenoid just need to clean up a little bit there that is an injector resistor that used to be sitting underneath the stock boost control solenoid I've remove that now um M's strut brace there's one in the front there's one in the rear these are T coilovers I'm not exactly sure which ones they are they are green in color I think most of them are the car has got off the market HD lights on it um V of batteries I've thrown

(Start: 00:05:08)
on not too much has been done on the car uh car is was making 303 KW and 441 newm and that was on one bar on Pump Fuel that was prior to the down pops and prior to pretty much everything else that you see on the car right now so quite excited to get it onto the dinno again I do need to tune the Boost controller properly I haven't done my offsets it is currently running back on one bar but it feels a hell of a lot stronger obviously the HKS EVC can monitor boost one 100 times of a second quicker than the stock 2 point noid that's on the car so I am excited to get it on um ECU that's on the car now needs to be changed urgently it's currently the stock ECU that has got a M's VX ROM on it so e was taken out sent to mines in

(Start: 00:06:10)
Japan and someone did some tuning on it for what was on the car at the time um it is running very rich at the moment it still pulls I'm guesstimating roughly about 330 to 350 KW at the moment um it is quite strong right let me start up car is relatively quiet quiet I think this back box that I have on the car right now is very

(Start: 00:07:18)
restrictive so I do have plans for this I would like to start small and just get a hard pop set up for the Boost um so hard boost PPS put in I'd like to get rid of the this twin turbo um intake that needs to come out I want to go custom aluminium 263 is into 76 there's minor things I want to do without having to open up the engine see how far I can take it the car's still running on its ceramic stock turbos I'd like to change those at some stage possibly depending on what I want to go for the 28 60s Dash sevens um what else suspension so there 10 suspension there's Cisco sway bars on the car there's Cusco end links on the front the rear has got Nismo end links uh bushes have been redone that's pretty much it so let me

(Start: 00:08:20)
do a quick rev video for you guys and I'll be uploading this shortly bear in mind there's no real editing to this video it's my first ever video I'm going to post a decent how-to video with editing Etc and see what you guys think of that like comment and subscribe if you can thanks very much guys also Link in the description to a good friend and inspiration he has been running his 1990 GTR for the last couple months and doing quite a lot of videos very informative I'm going to put a link right about here his name is goodzilla thanks very much guys
