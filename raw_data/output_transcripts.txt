(Start: 00:00:00)
I am going to reapply D and flea prevention for me something that some cats hate this man will just run away this has been an issue for me in the past and for many other I thought why not share how you do it and here I am so first thing that I'm going to need is some high value treats and if I find it the tick and flee prevention system I usually use revolution but you can only buy Revolution at a veterinarian Clinic I don't have a bed yet and I wanted to put something on Mia to make sure that she doesn't get any fleas or ticks I myself found two ticks already in less than a month but I want to make sure that Mia is protected for our walk I'm going to use the best that I could find on the counter which is from line plus I will add the link in the description if you want to check it out but it's a pretty popular one each of these is an applicator you have one those in each of these they recommend cutting this with scissors but I'm reckless so I'm going to do it by

(Start: 00:01:01)
[Applause] hand if you've never used one of these before it's probably a good idea for you to read the instructions I'm going to share with you how I do it but every brand is different and some of these products are toxic so this is mostly to teach you how to apply the product but when it comes to safety I would recommend you to read the instructions call the manufacturer or talk to the vet if you have any questions so I have the applicator have a high value treat and now I just need my cat Mia see good girl if your cat is wearing a color it's best to remove it because otherwise the product could get stuck into this then when you touch it then you touch your face whatever you want to remove it so that it doesn't soak anything that's not your cat's skin we will also move the fur out of the way so that the product gets inside the skin and not not into their coat the product is not even open

(Start: 00:02:02)
yet but I'm interacting with the product on her skin so that she normalizes this and whenever we are applying she doesn't run away so I do it I reward she's creating this positive association with o they're messing with my neck but I'm getting rewarded for it and she's going to be more receptive when we are actually applying the medicine I'm going to open this I know I brought some scissors around here aha pruning scissors M no Romy this is a private session off no okay you want to remove every other pet out of the room this is not something you want to share with dogs or other animals these products again these are pesticides and can be be toxic Mia come here come

(Start: 00:03:04)
here sit [Music] sit good girl this has to be a fun experience I'm a little nervous I have to be honest I had one situation in which she could leak the medicine and she oh she's starting to make we weird faces I think she's smelling it she's like oh this is disgusting I know Mia I know so I'm going to start separating fur here we want to apply this medicine at the back of their head in a place where we know that she cannot reach because if you do it too far back they can liak here and that can cause them to ingest the medicine and that's no bueno so anywhere at the B at the bottom of their neck this area this is great she's got such

(Start: 00:04:07)
thick fur I don't see anything Mia good girl I continue playing with this medicine on her neck while she's eating treats this way she's not freaking out with the smell she's getting used to the situation well she run away but I'm sure she's coming back Mia come here good girl sit I'm going to open the medicine because the smell is strong despite we've been getting her used to opening the hair placing the medicine in her neck she's still not going to like the smell and she's going to try to run away I'm going to put her on my lap in a position that I can control her a little better and then then I'm going to apply the

(Start: 00:05:17)
medicine good girl after applying the medicine they can become a little largic it's totally normal just let them rest and they're going to be better the next day if the lethargy lasts for more than I would say a day maybe you can call your bed and see what they think but it's pretty normal I don't want to give veterinarian advice because I'm not a veterinarian but me usually gets a little drowsy the first day and she's totally fine as you can see I'm giving her treats right after applying the medicine so that all this becomes a good experience she's not bothered by it she sometimes run runs away today it was a tremendous succcess because I took extra time to get her used to the medicine now because I have a dog I'm not going to let the dog interact with Mia the dog is called Romy she's my partner's dog I'm going to remain in this room for a little longer with Mia because I don't want the dog

(Start: 00:06:18)
interacting with Mia while the medicine is drying up I'm seeing that I applied it a little too low so I will be controlling also Mia to make sure that she doesn't liak the medicine I hope this was useful stay wild stay safe and I'll see you outd doors

Title: Cat Training Treats Used the Right Way
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khd9VgvVK-4

(Start: 00:00:00)
I want to treat that's so good that Mia cannot even consider ignoring it I treat that's so good that she's going to go crazy for that jackpot cat tree this person sent me a text that caught my attention she said something like wait a second let me check hey Albert love what you do do you have any recommendations for how to reward cats without treats I've tried giving my cat a few different Treats but he hasn't shown any interest this is the kind of energy that I want my treat to have on my cat [Music] this is such a common question I receive this question all the time first thank you Haley for texting me the question and for allowing me to share your experience with others in our YouTube channel there's a lot to unpack reasons behind cats not appreciating treats how to find the best treats for your cat and finally the jackpot cat treat what's the treat that I found that work works best

(Start: 00:01:00)
particularly if you want to train a cat I've kept this secret for a year as I was working on it but I'm finally ready to share it with you cats just like humans have individual preferences like crunchiness or flavor but I don't believe that's a reason 99.9% of the times that someone tells me that their cat doesn't like treats it's for one of these two reasons either they free feed their cats or they're feeding their cats keep let me know in the comment section below if you do any one of these two cats are designed to have a diet that's strictly carnivore but over the years to make the food cheaper manufacturers have added grain into the food and the treats they develop in addition to that and to be able to benefit from economizes scale and manufacture big amount of product and store it outside the fridge manufacturers have added also baking within the process of creating Kyo baking at high temperatures kills pathogens but in the process all also kills flavor and nutrients to compensate

(Start: 00:02:02)
for these loss of flavor and nutrients manufacturers then add back some external flavors and Aromas to make their kble irresistible for cats not necessarily healthy I have a full video talking about this this is not the topic for today you can take a look at this video if you're interested about cat nutrition I used to fit kble to Mia myself and what was happening is that the food that I was feeding M four times a day every single day day was as flavorful as the treats that I was trying to use to train her cats are very smart and they can pick on those things so if you're feeding kble and then you feed the same cookies with a different shape they don't consider them treats and therefore they're not willing to work for that treat that you're giving them because the food that they're getting every day it's equally tasty the second problem that I was mentioning earlier is that some cats have always food available for them imagine that every time that you're hungry you could eat you you're snacking all day long what happens if after snacking all day

(Start: 00:03:03)
long someone offers you food even if it's very tasty you might probably rejected maybe not but now imagine that on top of not being hungry they make you work for that food there's no way you're working for food when you're not hungry and the same thing goes for cats there's really only one way to know if a treat is good or not and it's looking at the nutritional value and the ingredients cats are Carnivor anything that's not meat or fish it's unnecessary if you buy your cat treats at a physical store just turn the back around the back of pack has all the information you need to know if a treat it's good or not for your cat if you buy online it's even easier Brands need to show the nutritional value on the listings on the online listings of their products so just go to the listing and look for that image that has a picture of the back of the pack there what I try to look for are catrid that have very few ingredients are high in protein low in fat and have no additives or preservatives the problem

(Start: 00:04:05)
is that some products that appear healthy on the outside are actually not forget about what the front of back says turn the back around and look at the nutritional value that's where the real information sits I got some examples for you I'm happy to read them out loud Fancy Feast limited ingredients have 23% protein 53% fat 11% fiber and 6% moisture frisky party mix have 29% protein 15% fat and 4% fiber we're talking about a 23% protein in one and 29% protein in the other one vists which is a single ingredient catrid has 87% of protein 7% of fat 1% of fiber and 3% of moisture this is the type of treat that you should be looking for if you want to give a good treat to your cat the front of the pack is usually a marketing landscape Brands will use the limits of

(Start: 00:05:07)
the law to claim things on the front of pack that entice you to buy this doesn't mean that every treat that it's not 100% meat it's bad for your cat just like chicken and waffles are not bad for humans if you don't abuse them but if you're planning to train your cat if you're planning to give treats on a regular matter to your cat maybe consider using some that are healthier or on the healthier side before we jump into the jackpot cat treat the treat that your cat cannot ignore I would love to ask you to subscribe to this channel it does make a massive difference for me and if you're finding value it's a great way for you to continue receiving notifications to know when we post new content I found M's favory cat treats it's Freez dried chicken they are single ingredient hardworking treats that that she cannot [Music] ignore they are low calorie single

(Start: 00:06:08)
ingredient but with all the Yum that they make me a go crazy this is great because when I work with her she doesn't hesitate she wants the treats and she wants them now she gets the treat that she loves and I get the peace of mind that I know that I'm giving her a treat that's actually good for her the only problem with these type of treats is that they are usually made for dogs they are way too big ow M enough this is why I created fistfuls all the benefits from freeze dried chicken in a size that is enjoyable for cats now that you know what treats to use with your cat you might consider teaching some trick that you could not teach before something that's a little bit more difficult my favorite ever trick you can teach a cat is to teach them to jump on your shoulder and the reason is very simple it's one of those tricks that cats can do and dogs can't and I love making dog people a little jealous I created a super simple method

Title: 3 HACKS to Get Any Cat Into a Carrier that PROS Use
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5yN0kJkAWE

(Start: 00:00:00)
this is how easy getting your cat inside your carrier should be no fighting no crying no fuss the best part you don't need an expensive carrier to achieve it your cat literally doesn't care my carrier is $30 and she does just fine because I taught Mia to travel on my shoulder I didn't need to teach her to go on a career until I had to visit my mom in Spain to go to Spain it was easy the problem was on the way back she was really not having it this is because cats like any other animal go through life experiencing things the things that are good we want to repeat and the things that are not we want to avoid I'm trying to film here get girl this is exactly the principle we use for training behaviors that are rewarded are more likely to be repeated in the future let's go back to the carrier M developed a negative response to a stimulus based on past experience in techn technical terms this is called

(Start: 00:01:01)
conditioned diversion or negative conditioning the first thing that I had to do was make me forget about these bad past experience by linking the carrier with positive ones the process of making good experiences outweight the bad experiences within a stimuli it's called desensitization and the way that I did it was basically leave the carrier outside always available for her to explore I would put toys I would put treats inside the carriers so every time that she got in touch with the carrier she was getting something good from it she soon started getting inside the carrier on her own when she was no longer afraid of the carrier I started teaching her to get into the carrier on command with the help of oper and conditioning in this video I'm going to teach you three different ways to teach your cat to get on the carrier on command by pointing with your finger by using a Target stick and finally the most impressive using a verbal command I would love to know know what's your favorite way to teach your cat to get on

(Start: 00:02:02)
the carrier on command giving me this type of information allows me to Define what type of content should I be working on in the future finger targeting is the first trick you should teach your cat it's very simple but I have a full video in case you need more details about it I will add the link in the description box down below you just need to add a treat between your middle finger and your thumb and then the index finger moves up and down your C it's going to approach your hand to smell the treat that you have between your middle finger and your thumb and on the process they're going to bump into your index finger that's moving up and down when that happens you click then reward repeat the process for as long as it's needed until your cat starts reacting to the finger moving up and down you're going to see that after very few repetitions your cat starts reacting to the finger and trying to bump their nose into your finger to get that click that gets them a reward when your cat consistently starts reacting to

(Start: 00:03:03)
your index finger moving up and down you can consider removing the treat between your middle finger and your thumb when you don't need any treat in your hand to get your cat to react to the movement means that your cat has already learned the trick another way to achieve the same effect it's using a Target stick the target stick has two benefits compared to finger targeting the first one is that it doesn't hurt if your cat decides to bite it the second one a little bit more practical it reaches further to get your cat to touch the Deep of the target STI with their nose the process is similar to the one that we're using when finger targeting it's very simple you literally point at the treat using your target stick

(Start: 00:04:04)
because Mia knows that this is a target stick she's literally not letting me do the training because she wants to touch it with their face good job you're such a good M it's messing with this video I'm just going to use the short version of the target stick so that she doesn't get treat basically you're pointing at the treat with the tip of your target stick your cat is going to use their smell to find where the treat is and they're going to get extremely close to the tip of your target stick because you're actually touching it when their nose gets close enough to the Target stick so that they can touch it you click then reward after a few repetitions just like Mia was doing your c is going to follow the tip of your target stick no matter what regardless of they being a treat or not when they do that even if there's no treat around click and reward because you want them to consistently follow the target stick whenever you have it out

(Start: 00:05:06)
the target stick is also going to be very useful to teach your cat Advanced tricks like waving your legs or jumping on your shoulder if you would like to get one I'm going to add the link of ours in the description box down below now that Mia follows my finger or the target stick I can get her to follow them to achieve movements that I could not achieve otherwise using finger targeting I can ask her to follow the finger until she is in the position that I want her to be and then I click and reward in the case of the target STI same thing just [Music] easier she reaches the Final Destination and touches with her nose the tip of the target Stak I click and re word at the beginning it might be hard to get your cat to follow long distances your finger or the target

(Start: 00:06:07)
stick start with short distances and increase them as they build confidence that after doing the work they're going to receive a reward the process of getting a cat to follow a treat a finger or the target stick it's called luring luring for instance it's the methodology we're going to use to teach a cat to jump on our shoulder if you're curious about teaching your cat shoulder training consider watching this video because I created a super simple method that it's going to get your cat on your shoulder in no time the last and most impressive way to teach your cat to get on the carrier on command is by using a word that means get inside the carrier this trick it's called place for teaching your cat the place command your cat needs to understand at least one other luring trick either finger targeting or Target stick targeting we we going to start pairing the visual command either the finger targeting or the target stick targeting with a word

(Start: 00:07:08)
great shorter words are easier to understand for your cat so if you're starting from zero I would recommend you a word like crate to teach your cat to get inside the carrier good girl repeat several times the command just saying crate and pointing at the carrier because your cat already knows luring they're going to follow your finger or follow the target stick inside the carrier because we're going to do it several times your cut is going to start linking the word with the fact that they are getting inside the carrier great now the objective is to make the visual command less and less apparent instead of pointing inside the carrier you can point next to the carrier or behind the

(Start: 00:08:10)
carrier and see what happened [Music] great good girl after a few repetitions of your cat following the visual command as well as the verbal command inside the carrier you can consider removing the visual command all together and basically two things can happen that your cat understands the word and they get inside the carrier if that happens make sure you click and reward very generously because this means that they learn that the word means get inside the carrier this is extremely valuable and you need to make sure that your cat keeps that memory inside their brain so that they continue doing it in the future the second thing that can happen is that your cat really doesn't understand what you're asking from them before you give up and say the word

(Start: 00:09:10)
again give your cat 20 to 30 seconds cats are slower than humans and dogs at processing verbal commands so we need to give them time to think process and try to do what we're asking them to do if you give your cat 20 to 30 seconds and they don't understand it go back to the visual command and continue pairing this visual command together with a verbal command trying to get your cat inside the carrier when you believe that your cat got it try again without the visual command my mom lives in Spain and I'm in New York so I visit her at least twice a year and Mia has become an expert at getting inside the carrier on command however getting the cat inside the carrier is just the first step cat rides and plane rides can be very anxiety producing for cats some cat parents prefer to medicate their Cat when they go on car rides or plane rides or even to take the cat to the bed but my point of view is that it's a lot better to get the cat used to the carrier and turn the

(Start: 00:10:13)
carrier into a safe space teaching Mia to be comfortable inside the carrier made a huge difference on herself and she stopped being anxious every time I had to travel but it also helped me be less anxious when I travel because I know that she's not as uncomfortable as she used to be I've put together two videos that you might want to consider Watching Next the first one about how to teach your cat to be comfortable on car rides and the second one it's an exhaustive list of things that you have to consider if you're planning a plain trip with your cat stay wild stay safe I'll see you Outdoors

(Start: 00:00:00)
teaching your cat to sit on command is enriching useful thank you this is how the trick looks like when your cat has already learned it [Music] [Music] okay see ing on command was one of the first streaks I taught my Academy I remember how she was walking between my legs when I was trying to feed her and I was so scared of stepping on her at the end of this video I'm going to share with you what are some of the most common mistakes that people make when teaching this trick to their cats so that you don't make them but first let me walk you step by step how to teach it to your cat I've divided the process in three very simple steps grab your jackpot cat read and place it between your middle finger and your thumb just like this

(Start: 00:01:00)
this is great because it helps us create a unique position while still holding the tree show the treat to your cat and let them smell it so that they link this position of the hand with treats foreign with your hand in this position get it closer to your cat over their head and towards their tail your cat because they know you have a treat it's going to follow your hand as you move it over their head and towards their tail at some point they're not going to be able to follow your hand anymore unless they sit down as soon as their butt touches the floor click then reward if you go to this point in the video and you don't know what a clicker is I really recommend you to watch this video first because it's going to teach you what's clicker training how the clicker works and how to charge the clip you know what the clicker is but you still don't have one I really recommend you to get one before

(Start: 00:02:03)
you start training your cat it makes a huge difference after a few repetitions your cat is going to consistently react to your hand gesture remove the treat from between your fingers but continue clicking and rewarding every time that your cat performs the trick you can now start using the word sit as you use the visual command and your cat will soon understand that the word sit means the same as the hand in this position and again continue clicking and rewarding when your cat's butt touches the floor regardless of being the sit command or the hand gesture there are a couple of things that might make teaching this trick a little harder your Gap might reject sitting down and close your hand or turn around instead if your cat turns around as you approach your hand over their head and towards their tails this means that they're nervous they're trying to understand where this hand is going a trick for you is to move the hands lower this will allow your cat to follow your hand with minimal effort and they

(Start: 00:03:03)
will likely decide to see it instead of turning around some cats might get nervous when learning this trick because the treat is going to go so close over their head that they're going to try to grab it and Claw out your hand instead of sitting down if that's the case with your cat try lifting your hand a little more so that the gap between your cat's head and your treat it's greater and they prefer to sit down instead of trying to reach out for the tree what's extremely important is that even if they clawed your hand you don't let the treat go if they learn that by hurting you you let the treat go you're going to be teaching them to hurt you instead of sitting down and you don't want that so whatever happens don't let the treat go unless they sin and when they sit click then reward after three years of training cast I have compiled some of the most common mistakes as well as the best tips and tricks to accelerate cat training so

Title: Do You Need a CLICKER to Train a Cat? - DON'T BUY until you watch this
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yjpGUfiXHw

(Start: 00:00:00)
use this clicker every time you train your cat and you will feel like you're cheating [Music] it's going to feel like cheating because despite you've tried to teach your cat things before you've struggled and using the clicker you're going to be able to teach one trick after another with minimal effort so minimal effort that you will be wondering why didn't I use a clicker before if you want to train your cat then you don't know where to start turn our short and free clicker training bootcamp it's only 10 days 10 minutes a day and you will learn all the basics to get started with clicker training look for the link below in the pinned comments one of the first questions that everybody faces when they start thinking about training a cat it should I get a clicker and I understand it taking care of a cat it's a lot more expensive than we originally anticipated can you train

(Start: 00:01:01)
a cat without a clicker absolutely the clicker only serves as a marker it's going to help you tell your cat exactly when they're doing the behavior that it's going to get them treats while the clicker sound is unique and consistent there are words like yes or good that can also work I haven't heard from people using mouth noises that I'm not going to try to repeat or snapping the fingers to Mark the behavior the clicker often Reigns Superior to any other marker its sound it's Unique and changing and devoid of any emotional fluctuation if the chosen word is consistent and clear it can in theory replace the clicker however this requires a higher level of awareness from the trainer also if you use a word that can be found in day-to-day conversations your cat might get confused and being like they said yes am I getting a treat for what if you want your cat to stand in two legs and you say good as your cat is Raising and then falling and then licking their paw your cat will have no idea why you said good

(Start: 00:02:04)
because so many things happen during the time that you're saying good or good girl it's so long and if your cat is not very clearly understanding what behavior is triggering the click and the reward it's going to be more difficult for them to repeat that behavior here in the future the beauty of using a clicker is that you can put all your energy in teaching your cat the trick and you can relieve yourself from having to crack a sound that's consistent unique and precise every single time just as a reminder the clicker has to be charged for it to work you don't know how to charge the clicker consider pausing this video and watching this one instead don't worry I'll be here waiting for you when you're ready to come back if I convinced you that you need a clicker you might be wondering now what makes a clicker a good clicker there are three things that I want my clickers to have a unique distinctive and consistent sound that cannot be found anywhere outside the training session a ring so that it stays in my hand even if I need to grab three to do something with my hands and

(Start: 00:03:06)
finally that it has a soft and gentle sound because I'm going to be doing most of the training session indoors and I don't want to overwhelm the cat with a very loud noise consider for a second that dogs can hear twice as much as humans in cats can hear twice as much as dogs most of the clickers in the market are designed for dogs outdoors and we're training a cat indoors try to keep it quiet in the description below you will find the link of our clicker if you don't want to get this particular clicker any other clicker it's going to be better than using a word or a mouth sound

when you start sharing your life with a pet you can feel the love from the very beginning but you also notice very early on that communication can be hard as if you spoke different language but guess what you do with time you will learn what your cat wants by observation and repetition but it will take a lot longer for your cat to understand what you want from them these can be a source of frustration because they jump on the counter and you don't want them to or because you call them and they ignore you or everything in between today's video is all about helping you communicate with your cats so that they learn what you need from them as fast as you learned what they need from you let's play a quick game I'll describe a situation and you're gonna tell me what your cat wants down in the comments below one you open the fridge and your cat comes running towards you number two you see your cat sitting in front of a closed door number three you hear your cat meowing very loudly from across the house write it in the comments below I

(Start: 00:01:02)
can't wait to read your answers we learn what our cat wants by trial and error they insist until we give them what they want and once we give them what they want they relieve us from their ask they're literally rewarding us for our good behavior on the flip side cats don't understand what we want from them particularly if we don't reward them after they do what we want them to do positive reinforcement is a deliberate way to speak cat it will give you the tools to reward your cat for good behavior helping them understand you and making communication be directional the best way to use positive reinforcement for training is using operand conditioning with the help of a clicker a clicker is nothing more than a noise making device that allows us to Mark the exact behavior that we're going to reward because behaviors that are rewarded are likely to be repeated in the future however the sound of the quicker it's not rewarding for your cat when you first buy it you need to have

(Start: 00:02:04)
your cat understand what the sound of a clicker means the process of priming your cat with the knowledge that after a click comes a reward it's called charging the clicker the clicker helps us bridge the gap between the behavior that we want to reward and the reward that comes after performing The behavior I will create a short video with alternatives on what to use if you don't want to get a clicker but my recommendation is to buy one you can find them from very cheap or you can find more premium ones that are specific to cats and meant to train indoors but clickers in general are going to make your training much easier if you want a clicker and you don't know which one to get you'll find the link to the one we use in the description down below to charge the clicker we're just going to create the expectation of a treat after the click sound how many times does your cat need to meow until you open that door well more or less those are the amount of times that you will need to click and reward for your cat 200 understand that after a click comes a reward but the process is simple you

(Start: 00:03:04)
just click and reward click and reward click and reward foreign [Music] 10 to 15 repetitions your cats appetite it's going to start diminishing so try to schedule several training sessions a day through the course of a few days to keep the value of the treats as high as possible there are two main reasons to keep sessions short about 10 minutes per session your cat's stomach is about the size of a ping pong ball and as soon as it's full your cat's interest portraits diminishes the second one is that cat treats should not account for more than 10 percent of your cat's total calorie intake to keep their nutrition complete and balanced to pieces of advice before we get started try to schedule your training sessions right in between the two meals this is going to help your cat

(Start: 00:04:05)
be slightly hungry but not too hungry that they are anxious about the treats that you're offering them the second one is to use low calorie treats low calorie trades will allow you to train for longer because they're not going to get as full and the amount of calorie intake that they're going to be receiving for the treats it's a smaller I use freeze dried chicken and if you want to get the ones that I use you'll find the link in the description box down below now I know that you're not gonna stop here but you need to know what to teach your cat next and the answer is simple a foundational trick a trick that's going to help you teach all the tricks after that one and today it's your lucky day because you don't need to do any research I've already placed the video here so you know what to teach your cat next you are now a cat whisperer

67 percent of cats like cuddling with their Human family and hundred percent of people like cuddling with their cats who doesn't like the worms of their kitten on their lap or making biscuits on the valley to gently wake them up in the morning that was not the case with me whenever I tried to pet Mia she would avoid my hand as if it was poison and if I placed her on my lap she would jump right off it would throw me everywhere around the house which meant that she liked me but she would only sit on my lap or cuddle very sporadic I taught her to cuddle with me and I want to share with you exactly how I did it I started the diary and I recorded every occasion where Mia was being cuddly and I found a few things that every cuddle occasion had in common I think I'm able to draw a causation effect I want to share with you what are the main occasions that get my cat to cuddle with me so that likely it's going to help you color with your cat more as independent and solitary Hunters cats exhibit various behave

behaviors that reflect their self-reliance like their preference for solitary exploration territorial marking and self-grooming routine the problem comes when we look at cats using dogs as Benchmark because these suspicious couldn't be more different different things can affect your cat's predisposition to being petted stress or fear because cats are also preyed upon by larger Predators this makes cats more aware and conscious of things happening around them and being crap or petted can often activate their fight or flight response sometimes if you grab your cat and they're not moving that doesn't necessarily mean that they are enjoying the situation it's best to let the cat initiate the cuddling to make sure that it's something that they are actually looking for sensitivity is another reason why some cats don't like to be petted cats feel touch in different ways the hair follicles on their belly are hypersensitive to touch they are designed to inform them of their surroundings for hunting or protection this sensitivity can be over stimulating

this is why some cats don't like to be pet in those areas it's important to know and respect your cat's priorities and even though cats like their independence they still can form strong bonds with other pets and humans not only that we can even train a cat to cuddle so stick around because I'm going to cover this towards the end of this video today Mia sat on my lap on her own I was working from home sitting on the sofa you jump next to me and walked up and down several times until she decided to start making biscuits on my lap making working very uncomfortable this is very cute but I can assure you it's also very painful because Hair Plus are Sharp after making biscuits for something close to a minute she curled up and decided to sit on my lap after some thinking I realized that there are a few factors influencing this Behavior the sofa is one of her chosen places to rest during daytime hours so by sitting in this area I make it very easy for her to

Title: Can AirTag Recover my Lost Bengal Cat?

(Start: 00:00:00)
can a 29 coin size tracker help you find the lost cat as a kid parent I've never experienced anything as hard-wrenching as losing Mia and it becomes particularly stressful when it happens while you're traveling in a foreign country with stray dogs on the loose this is the exact situation I found myself into a couple months back I was traveling with a few friends in Mexico and while we were dining out Mia decided to just escape the hotel room and go for a walk the overwhelming feeling of helplessness was unbearable just picture this going back to your cabin it's pitch black you enter the room and you hear nothing it looks like your cat is not there but that can be happening to you right she was wearing a collar with an air tag and while Apple doesn't recommend using air attack for pets it helped me find my cat I would like to share with you why I believe Apple doesn't want people using air attack for their pets but also how it helped me recover my cadmium a GPS tracker would have solved that in a breeze but they are bulky quite expensive offensive and

(Start: 00:01:00)
most of the times they require a monthly fee that becomes useless if you're not traveling all the time that's when I started considering the Airtel to track my cadmia but the question is can a 29 coin size tracker help you find the lost cat if you don't have an iPhone don't worry this video is applicable to you as well because there are alternatives in the market that work with Samsung and other devices all the information about the products that I took in this video are available in the description box down below this video is going to be divided in three parts what's an air attack and how it works the main benefits and flaws of Airtex and finally how I use standard attack to recover my lost cat in Mexico we're shooting a video you know do you need attention yes she heard that I was talking about her and she's like I gotta be part of this you have something to say you want to grab the mic and say something

(Start: 00:02:01)
make sure you stay until the end of the video because there's a few reasons why Apple doesn't want people using air tags to recover their pet those reasons are linked with the flaws that this device has and you don't want to make mistakes when expecting to recover your chat thanks to an air attack and then realizing that it's not exactly what you thought it would be yep good start Apple Earth it's a small circular d-shaped device that uses Apple's fine my network to help you keep track of and find your belongings you can attach your Air Attack to any object and use the find my app on your iPhone or your iPad to help you find those objects the Airtech uses Bluetooth technology to connect with nearby Apple devices Apple recommends using Airtex to track objects not people or pets and while air tags are not Flawless Apple said that it's mostly to protect the company from legal action but it did help me recover my cat and I personally believe that it's too good to be true to use an air attack on your cat you will need three things an air attack an air

attack holder and the collar remember that colors have to be break away for them to be safe for cats again I'll add the links of the ones that I use in the description box down below once the Air Tech is on the holder and the holder is secured to the cat collar you can put the color on your cat once the airtek is connected to your phone and you're trying to recover your pad three things can happen the best is a scenario I am closing off to the Air Tech and the Air Tech connects via Bluetooth with my phone also because there's other Apple devices in the area Apple can triangulate exactly where the cat is an arrow will appear on your screen even pointing you to the direction and indicating how far your cat is from you the second best case is when your phone can connect to the air tag via Bluetooth but there's no other devices that will help you exactly triangulate where your cat is this is scenario just still very good for two main reasons instead your cat It's relatively close because the Bluetooth range of these devices it's around 30 feet the second reason that

(Start: 00:04:02)
makes this the second bestest scenario is that once you're connected to your Air Attack via Bluetooth you can activate the Airtech to produce a sound it's not very loud but it's better than nothing and it can help you locate your cat even if they're hiding luckily if the cat gets out of range the Eartha can still provide you some value giving you a general General sense of your cat's whereabouts when you cannot directly connect with your cat via Bluetooth you will need to turn the Lost mode on your Air Attack you can do this through the find my app on your iPhone when you activate the Lost mode and your cat gets within Bluetooth range of any Apple device that device is going to upload your CAD slash location to the cloud then your phone using the find my app it's going to download that location and it's going to tell you where your cat was seen for the last time also if someone gets close enough to your Air Attack they can retrieve your personal information and the phone that you will have inputted there so they will have the chance to call you and let you know that they found your cat before I use the air tag when traveling with me I did

(Start: 00:05:03)
a few tests around the house and I learned some of the biggest flaws when we're trying to use Airtex to track a pet first one is that when you put a collar on a cat it has to be a breakaway color this means that if your cat escapes and for whatever reason they lose the color your phone is going to help you find the Air Attack and therefore the color but not necessarily your cat the second floor is that when you are in a big open space the Bluetooth range gets reduced quite drastically making it almost impossible for your phone to connect to the Air Attack via Bluetooth unless you're almost on top of it and in that case you would already see your cat the third fluid is that whenever you have the Lost mode activation if another device sees the Air Attack it's going to send you the last location where that phone saw the air attack but it's not going to give you a moving dot like we're used to on Google Maps and finally the fourth floor and to me the most important one is that if you're in the middle of the mountain and there's no other Apple devices or houses even if your cat is wearing an airtight there's no way for you to connect your phone or other

(Start: 00:06:04)
devices with the air attack and therefore you're never going to learn your cat's location unless your cat gets near people or near a house so this and while Airtex are not Flawless Mia was wearing an air attack when she got lost in Mexico and that made a huge difference in helping me find her so I'm gonna show share with you step by step exactly what I did to recover my cat using the Air Attack when I arrived at the hotel room the room felt kind of empty quiet while immediately a cold sweat sensation inundated in my body I know that 80 of cats that get lost are found within the house or within the backyard so the first thing that I did was a thorough research inside the hotel room I grabbed a few treats and I started calling her by her name and nothing happened I immediately grabbed my phone and opened the find my app if she was inside the room or anywhere nearby yeah would connect via Bluetooth to my phone and I would be able to know exactly what she is it did not happen getting Goosebumps at that point I knew that Mia was not in the room I got into

(Start: 00:07:04)
panic mode and I went outside I told my friends that Mia was not there and we all started calling her by her name with treats and trained to not sound panicked because if you sound Panic your cat is likely not going to show up I turned the Air Attack into lost mode and I started walking around the areas that Mia already knew because we were walking there with the harness and the leash that same morning after 10 minutes that felt like a lifetime it finally happened I received a notification saying that an iPhone had located me a nearby oh my the relief only 50 of the job was done but Mia was somewhere and at least they had a location that I could go to to continue my search I checked the location on the map and started walking towards her while I was walking towards the location my phone got connected to the air tank Mia was within 30 feet of where I was I still could not see her so I decided to play a sound and then I heard it she was just on top of a fence staring at me completely chill enjoying

(Start: 00:08:06)
her time out I walked calmly towards her and without much effort I put the harness on her and with me on my shoulder we walked back to the hotel I'm not saying that if your cat is wearing an air attack there's no way you're gonna lose them but I am saying that if your cat is wearing an air attack your chances of finding them if they get lost increased drastically the best way to never lose a cat is to walk them Outdoors using a harness and a leash this is something that I've been doing for the last three years and I've learned a lot from it seeing the joy in Mia's eyes when we're walking on a leash it's invaluable so watch this video next to teach your cat how to walk on a leaf stay wild stay safe and I'll see you Outdoors

took me a while to decide whether I should or I should not spay my cadmium I was filled with questions and killed spaying or neutering will hopefully be the biggest surgery of your cat's life and it implies the removals of the reproductive organs and the consequent hormonal changes and this procedure comes with many questions and for many people also with you I often receive questions about spaying or nurturing cats but while Meats is paid I don't have the expertise so I ask help for this one I've partnered with excited cats they are company dedicated exclusively at providing the best kitten Care Resources they even have a food recall alert system that it's free to subscribe so I really recommend you to check it out but today we're going to cover neutering and spaying Cuts why you should do it what are the pros and the cons and how to take care of a kitten that has just been spayed let me introduce you to Isabel ludic who is going to take over from here thanks Albert for the warm introduction and opportunity to talk about a really important subject the spraying and

(Start: 00:01:02)
neutering of cats I just like to mention that this information has been backtracked and vet approved by our in-house veterinarian Dr Paula Cuevas what is the difference between Spain and neutering Spain refers to the removal of a female cat's reproductive organs the ovaries and the uterus whereas neutering refers to the removal of a male cat's reproductive organs so the testicles and other related structures what are the benefits of spaying or neutering your cats it is by far the most effective way to reduce overpopulation of cats and essentially produce animal suffering and overcrowded shelters and unnecessary euthanasia on average 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized every year in the United States it also helps eliminate potential health issues down the road like various Cancers and diseases of protesters ovaries and

uterus finally there are also many behavioral benefits When fixing your cats especially in male cats who are far more prone to display unwanted sexual behaviors such as roaming around fighting localizing and urine spraying at what age should you consider spaying or neutering your cat there has been lots of debate about the ideal age the standard age is six months although more and more vets are advocating for early spay and neuter which can occur in kittens as young as eight weeks old according to Dr Cuevas a cat who is not going to be used for any reproduction should be desexed after allowing one or two heat Cycles to pause in the case of females but they should be kept under strict observation and control as females can also get quite Rowdy when it comes to these times I'm hearing the heat cycle the reproductive instincts are so strong that a cat will try to

(Start: 00:03:06)
escape not everyone will be able to keep their plates under such strict control that's why it's better to do this procedure as early as possible just note that different states and countries have different rules and regulations when it comes to these things is early spay and neuter safe although a lot of people are concerned about early spay and neuter there have been overwhelming reports from veterinarians indicating that early spay and neuter is just as safe if not safer than surgeries that are done at six months age cats can get pregnant as young as four months old surgeries for younger cats or are easier to perform and the duration is shorter because they are much smaller hey girl okay listening in on some spaying and neutering advice good good important Lily actually had a litter of kittens because I didn't spare her early enough so learn from us younger cats are also more capable of

quick recovery than older cats so how long do cats need to recover after such a procedure while many cats feel more like themselves after a couple of days you should expect the full recovery period to be around two weeks over this time period you'll need to take extra special care of your cat to make sure that they heal as quick as they can how to do this provide them with a quiet recovery room or area where they can rest without being disturbed for the first five days make sure they have access to all the Necessities keep an eye on them and make sure to look out for the normal and the not so normal signs and symptoms which I'll go over in a moment make sure the wound is clean and the cat does not lick it provide the post-surgery medications in a timely manner these are the normal recovery symptoms eating less sleeping more walking slowly and a little wobbly choosing not to jump and appearing and focused these are the

more concerning things you should look out for and contact your vet immediately when any of them are presents swelling redness or heat at the surgery sites bleeding or a strange odor coming from the surgery site lack of appetite after the first 12 hours mythology extending for more than 12 hours walking with a hunched appearance shivering pale Browns vomiting or diarrhea or when your cat feels too cold or too warm we highly recommend contacting or visiting a veterinarian when you have specific questions or if you're worried about your cat's health and well-being thanks again Albert for the opportunity and I hope to see you all soon thank you so much for these amazing resources available one of the main questions that I receive After People fix their cat is whether their cat is depressed or just in this video Isabel is going to cover what are the causes and signs for cat depression so make sure to watch this video next and I'll see you next time

Title: Talking Buttons - How to Turn Your Cat into a Chatty Companion

(Start: 00:00:00)
have you ever wished you could talk to your cat or most importantly get your cat to tell you what they want you want to train the buttons instead come on do you want to train [Music] do you want to train okay the train get ready to enter into the future of cat training because I'm going to share with you what talking buttons are as well as the first steps that you need to follow to get your cat to talk to you using communication buttons talking buttons or communication buttons are small devices that when pressed are going to produce a pre-recorded sound when using buttons to communicate with our pets the sound that is going to be produced it's a word linked to a meaning you can train our cats to link a specific sound with a desire and later on to press the button to express that desire these buttons were invented for a different purpose and communicating with our cats they are called assistive technology and they are

(Start: 00:01:00)
designed to provide additional accessibility to individuals that have speech difficulty just a few years ago a very smart group of people decided to start using this assistive technology first with dogs and later on with cats to see if they could communicate with the results amazing you've probably seen plenty of videos of dogs and cats expressing their desires using but assistive technology when used with dogs or cats it's commonly known as stalking buttons Billy speaks is a cat that uses communication buttons very effectively he's become one of the most famous talking animals in the world and he's learning new words very quickly he already has a massive board filled with words but they didn't start there and neither should you let me walk you through the steps that you need to follow to teach your cat to use communication but you would think that the first thing that you need to do is to buy talking buttons but the answer is no you can start teaching your cat words way earlier than that for instance I taught Mia the word hungry without talking button I asked her if she's hungry and she answers meow are you hungry

(Start: 00:02:02)
okay words are the link between thoughts and the real world and whenever you can establish that link you're moving forwards in the adventure of teaching your cat to speak it is a good idea to get organized when it comes to the words that you want to teach and when how should you choose the first words to teach your cat your cat is trying to communicate with you most of the time through body language as they do with other cats I created a video helping you understand your cat's body language which you can check after watching this one I'll add the link in the description box down below also some cats are going to meow to their owners for a variety of reasons when they want attention to ask for food be let out or to complain about some sort of discomfort by paying attention to what your cat tells you through body language and males you're going to know what your cat values most probably your cat can even identify a few words already like outside lay food or hungry start with those I personally found using two words instead of one was easier so I started with two words outside and train I like the word train because it goes very closely related with food when we're doing Clicker training she needs to work for her food

(Start: 00:03:05)
and she's getting treats in exchange so I'm using that button she's actually asking for food or to train but she gets both she won't get the food for free and the other one is outside she often sits in front of the balcony waiting for me to open the door but I don't always see her a button there will help a lot there are many Brands offering Butters to communicate with your cat but the ones that you're going to see in this video are from fruit I will add the link in the description box down below fluent pet it's not sponsoring this video in any way but amongst all the buttons that I've tried these are the ones that are easier to press which is ideal for cats and the sound is fairly good there are two ways in which we can train a cat to press a button some people recommend using only modeling to train a cat to press a button because otherwise by using targeting your cat is going to need that button with a trick the problem with a dog or a cat pairing the button with a treat it's that they can get hung up on that and not expect anything but food from pressing the button based on my own experience the easiest way to train a cat to press a button is by using targeting the solution that I found to overcoming the problem of the buttons turning into food

(Start: 00:04:07)
dispensing machines it's to use the word train instead of three after the button is pressed I'm going to ask my cat to perform a trick sit spin lay down whatever and then reward her this allows me to give a treat to my cadmia but she still has to work for it to teach her how to press a button by using targeting we're going to use clicker training there are many types of targets actually anything can be a Target and I like using things that I have around the house for this exercise Post-it notes come in very handy because we're going to use clicker train to do this exercise you're going to need the Post-it notes a clicker and some treats let's assume that you know what clicker training is and that your clicker is charged if you have never heard of clicker training before don't worry I have a very easy tutorial teaching you how to click or train your cat in three very easy steps you can watch the video here and come back once you've watched that take a Post-It note and hide the treat behind when your cat touches the note click then reward repeat it a few times until your cat links touching the posted with a reward then you can remove the tree

(Start: 00:05:07)
and keep on rewarding after your cat touches the Post-it continue clicking and rewarding every time that your cat touches a Post-It note by using the post it as a Target we're going to train our cat to put their paw on top of the posting note in exchange of a tree once your cat is very comfortable doing that you can take the positive note and put it on top of a button getting your cat to press a button for the first time for the Post-it note a couple of times to make the surfaces smaller and keep rewarding when your cat touches the Post-it note on top of the button after a few repetitions or a few sessions your cat is going to get very comfortable at touching that posting note on top of a button in exchange of a tree they are even going to get very eager about it and they're going to press so strong that the button is going to sound when that happens the stop rewarding your cat whenever they touch the button but it doesn't sound allowing them to understand that you're only going to reward them when the button is properly pressed and a sound comes out from it behavior that is driven and by internal satisfaction it's called intrinsic motivation once your cat learns how to

(Start: 00:06:08)
press a button and that buttons trigger actions let the modeling begin using the buttons themselves to express their needs should be rewarding enough so don't lure them with trades once they know how to press the button that's the only way they'll learn to press a button when they need something when they need it so now that you know how the buttons work you need to choose a place where they will sit some cats find it easier to use the buttons when they are close to what they mean for instance the outer button near the door whenever you see your cat it's asking for something like we were saying before through body language meows or even when they start pressing the button you need to model it as well so if for instance they are sitting on the door you click the outside button and then you open the door the process more or less works as follows you say outside outside press the button and then you direct your cat's attention towards opening the door or letting them go outside both for humans and for cats when learning a new language the first stage it's observing and absorbing this will be the first stage for your cat and it's going to

(Start: 00:07:08)
take some time don't get discouraged and keep modeling by pressing the buttons and saying the words out loud there's one day in which your cat will press a button on their own and from there it's downhill add new words as long as your cat understands what each button means regardless of where the board takes place do not add more words until you're not sure that your cat understands what each individual word means I started with two buttons outside and train I will continue with words that are also highly motivating for Mia like play and probably after that I'm going to add some specificity to the word outside with balcony and hallway adding too many words too fast it's going to overwhelm your cat and confuse them and these are only level 1 words that relate to things or activities teaching your cats a more advanced words like time emotions or self-awareness should come when your cat is already mastering a bunch of level one words as you use the the buttons you might see that your cat gets overly obsessed about a particular button avoid starting with food or treats if your cat

(Start: 00:08:10)
is overly food motivated if that's the case of your cat consider adding a button with hold on finished or later we have covered a lot in this video and the very first step is to understand what words you need to start teaching your cat so take a look at this video to see what words you need to start with by observing and learning from their body language

(Start: 00:03:13)
660 pounds there are some campsites where dogs and cats are not allowed if you end up in a campsite that they don't allow pets because you didn't check it you're going to make the experience a little uncomfortable because either you will need to improvise or you will need to sneak the cat inside and that would make it impossible for your cat to go out and explore which is the number one reason why we would take our cats camping which takes me to the tip number five prioritize your cat's well-being whenever in doubt pick the choice that's going to make your cat more comfortable so as I was saying before you arrive at the campsite you're ready to build a tent but your cat is eager to explore what should I do go and explore with your cat that's why you're taking them when they are tired and satisfied you go build it then you're going to see that it's way more productive foreign

number six provide your head a safe space some cats might not feel comfortable roaming around while you build a tent if that's the case of your cat is a good idea to provide them with a space where they can unwind and disconnect because they feel safe their carrier a cat cave or even a captain are good options for that tip number seven bring plenty of water and food cats have sensitive stomachs so you should stock up plenty of food so that your cat doesn't have to switch Brands during the trip and if you wouldn't drink that water your cat shouldn't so bring along a water filter or some water for your cat as well if your cat is not a big water Drinker wet food is going to help your cat stay operated thank you tip number eight bring a Long Leash a Long Leash is going to provide your cat more room and freedom to explore the outdoors tethering your cat is not

recommended particularly if they are unattended hats are great at escaping from harnesses which brings me to the next tip tip number nine harness train your cat before the trip it can take a while to harness train a cat and a cat that is comfortable and a harness is a cat that is not going to try to escape from that harness I designed the harness that Mia is wearing because there was nothing in Market that I felt comfortable with it's available for sale on our website as well as on Amazon I'm going to add the links in the description box on that tip number 10 bring a portable litter box even if your cat is usually comfortable making their number ones and number two outdoors in the wild sometimes there might be a dog or something that makes your cat anxious a portable litter box it's going to give your cat the freedom to choose where they feel more comfortable and happy to attend the nature calling and you might be wondering was this massive 10 that this these people are using well Peter the guy that I mentioned earlier wasn't a trade show and he fell in love with this stand I don't know how he did it but he put his hands on a sample to try

Title: What Bengal Cats Do When Their Owner is Away

(Start: 00:00:00)
Bengal cats are a very energetic breed I'm going to be out of home for more than 10 hours a day between commute and working hours and I have no idea what she's going to be up to while I'm gone particularly if she gets bored but I have a plan I'm going to find out what MIA does when I'm not home my cat has never been separated from me for more than a couple hours this copy it started we have been traveling together and I've been working remotely we moved to the Caribbean for five months then we were working from Spain and also went to Mexico for a few weeks but now we're back in New York because the company that I work for once employees to be back at the office the times that I've left me alone she can become very vocal and I don't think it gets to a point where she has separation anxiety but she really doesn't like being alone and I am worried that going back to the office can trigger misbehavior I created a video talking about cat separation anxiety and cats missing their owners a while back I'm going to add the link in the description box down below but we're going to leave it outside this video today my master plan has two parts on one end I am going to do everything I can to keep me and entertain while I'm

(Start: 00:01:00)
out and I'm going to film everything so that if there's a misbehavior I can course correct and if there's something that goes wrong I can improve it that they have to keep her entertained I have a fancy cat wall as well as food toys I'm even more serious about learning the mischievous behaviors and plants that she has while I'm out I'll be using the UV bed camera I think it's the model d605 to seeing what she's up to it's a really formidable Gadget it has an HD camera and an infrared system that ensures that the video it's always bright it also has a microphone so with me it's meowing it's going to send me an alarm to my phone Mia definitely acts different when I'm not around and I want to make sure that she's drinking and eating while I'm out and despite the UV camera has a 270 degree Vision cam it doesn't go through walls so I'm going to use two cameras to make sure that I have my bedroom as well as the living room covered anyway with these two cameras working 24 7 thanks to the motion sensors there are still dead Corners in my house so I'm going to attach little tiny camera on Mia so that I know what

(Start: 00:02:02)
she does When She's Out Of Reach from the two yuffie cameras to make sure that Mia has food throughout the day I'm going to be using food puzzles you put some given inside them and then close the door in order to eat the cat has to play with the toy and the food will be released little by little from a small hole that the toy has okay it's already 7 30 and I need to go to work I'm going to give some tricks to distract me and while I hide the food toys I will place one of them on the Cat wall and the other one I'm gonna hide it between a couple pillows in the living room my objective is that she finds one around noon and the other one around 2 or 3 P.M which is very food driven and she has an amazing sense of smell so we'll see what happens foreign [Music] is that they last all day but Jesus

(Start: 00:03:04)
market and as I was saying she might be out of food in just a couple hours everything looks correct so far but I bet she knows I have hidden food I'm sure she can smell it well I just made it to the office and looks like she's spending most of the morning sleeping it's 11 A.M and I'm starting to be hungry I guess Mia is as well let's see if she found the food [Music] oh she's 100 from the foot [Music] but the other one seems stealing tag which is very much in line with the expectations

(Start: 00:04:05)
I really needed a coffee and to be honest I also wanted to check on Mia looks like she has already woken up from her new nap I think she's on the quest of finding the other food puzzle and I'm still six hours from arriving home oh my God this is so cool I like to see what jumps look like from her angle she's a total athlete with her little paws and her little legs taking her everywhere it also made me very happy to see that she drunk a little here this out by 1 pm Mia had already found both food toys and that meant that she would not eat until 6 or 7 PM that I would arrive home and for sure she would be hungry luckily the yuffie pet camera has some food inside and you can use it to feed your cat while you're out so I spend most of my afternoon and the trip back home tossing food to Mia hey Mia have you missed me I've missed you too good boy I freaking love the bond that I have with me it makes going on adventures so easy and coming home so rewarding if you want to learn more about bonding with your cat you totally have to watch this

(Start: 00:00:00)
would you trust your cat harness enough to leave your cat attached to a pole you probably wouldn't because cats are escape artists and no harness is safe enough i have here the outdoor bengal cat harness to show you why i believe this is the best harness out there it will take me about an hour to film and edit the video that you are watching and on the meantime to prove you how much i trust this harness me it's going to be outside attached to a pole unsupervised she's wearing the outdoor bengal cat harness and i've placed a gopro strategically to film everything that she's doing while i'm filming this video this is just for illustration purposes only we have a very safe backyard we're in the pyrenees there are almost no predators it's very safe for me to be outside please do not do the same this is not the recommendation to leave your cat outside unattended attached to a pole this is a review for the outer bengal cut harness one of the two products that we're launching in the season 2022 for adventure cats it is a harness that has been designed by cat parents exclusively for adventure cats

(Start: 00:01:00)
it's lightweight and flexible adjustable and designed to be escape proof more on these later in this video the harness is available on amazon as well as on our website www.outdoorbengal.com the unboxing is pretty minimal you will receive a cardboard box with some instructions in the back you open it up and there are two little bags one with the harness and one with the leash the leash is a light six feet long leash with an anti-twist carving air in one end and the loop in the other end the harness is a little disruptive compared to what we are used to seeing in the market the chest pad is fairly small and thin made from neoprene the cut harness comes with its side bends and the cord stoppers stretch all the way out for easy fitting once the harness is on the cap we are going to have to adjust it to their size for a snug fit my cadmium has been out for about 20 minutes now and the harness seems to be holding just fine the harness it's light on our hand and all cords and pads are minimal which makes it feel very adaptable to the cat's

(Start: 00:02:00)
movements the chest pad has three rings that will allow free movement to the straps that go around the neck and around the body at the top of the harness there's the skate proof system that's escaped from harnesses by pulling backwards what this system does it's close the headspace when the cat pulls back making it narrower as the cat pulls and releasing as the cat stops pulling back when the cat walks normally the system is not triggered and all the pressure is applied through the chest path protecting the cat's neck there are five things to look for on a cat harness hard to escape from we walk our cats on a leash to keep them restrained training a cat to be comfortable wearing a harness is key even more so than a harness that it's hard to escape from but a harness that i can trust is the number one thing i look for in a harness for my cat number two it's safety we want a harness that is going to be gentle with our cat harnesses that are entirely made out of string can be a little harsh on our cat's neck particularly on small kittens number three a harness should be easy to be put on and off on cats that are not used to wearing a harness we want to minimize

(Start: 00:03:02)
the stress produced when putting the harness on them a harness that is easy to be put on it's going to make habituation a lot easier four it's comfort we walk our cats to enriching their lives a harness should not be limiting their ability to thrive outdoors and finally durability we should look for a harness that's going to stay with our cats for a while because once they get used to it it's a lot easier to get them enjoy outdoors we want a harness that is going to be able to take wear and tear as well as adjust as our cat grows this harness has been designed to deliver against these five attributes it's hard to escape from comfortable for the cat easy to put on and off safe for their necks and made out of nylon so it's very durable to put the harness on your cat ask your cat to sit and stay if your cat doesn't know how to sit and stay you can secure the cat by squishing them with your elbow so your hands stay free place the harness through the head first tighten the cord stopper so that the chest pad hangs around the chest area below the neck finally buckle the side straps after the

(Start: 00:04:02)
harness is on try placing two fingers between the neck loop and your cat if there's more space in that tighten up the cord stopper repeat the process with the side straps place two fingers between the straps and the cap if more than two fingers fit tighten up the buckles on the side until you can fit two fingers but no more than that what happens if your cat plumps on the floor if your cat plumps on the floor means that your cat is not very comfortable wearing the harness loosen the side straps and use play and foot to have your cat forget that they're wearing a harness in this particular case it's more important than ever to keep the sections short and sweet after the session try placing the harness in areas where your cat hangs out so that they can impregnate the harness with their pheromones going outdoors should not be done until your cat is very comfortable wearing the harness this harness has been designed to be escape proof but no harness is 100 escape free i really recommend doing a proper harness implementation particularly if your cat has never been outdoors on a leash before if you don't know where to start take a look at this video here where i

(Start: 00:00:00)
cats are so skilled at learning new things that they can even learn tricks that dogs can't there are seven levels of cat tricks and today you're going to see with your own eyes how far can cat training go from easy to unimaginable level 1 creating routine you go to the kitchen and you open the fridge and before you notice your cat is there staring at you with a slight tail twitch mildly anxious wondering am i going to get something for free this time routine is a very strong motivator and your cat will learn to expect something just by observing you move around the house use routine to your favor helping your cat understand what comes next and another positive side effect of routine is predictability predictability allows your cat to live a more relaxed life because they know what to expect some ways in which you can use routine to your favor to improve your cat life feeding schedule daily liter box routine with the cleaning done always at the same hour going to bed always at the same time this one is crucial if you want your cat to not wake you up and waking up always at the same time

(Start: 00:01:02)
regardless of the weekday for cats every day is scatter day on the other hand though there are routines that you don't want your cat to learn when you go to the vet for instance the carrier should not be associated with going to the vet or else whenever you take the carrier out your cat is going to know that something bad is happening and they're gonna hide making it almost impossible for you to grab them to go to the bed try to take the carrier out from whatever you're storing it inconsistently so your cat can appreciate having a carrier around to use it at their will then whenever you need to use that carrier to go on a trip or to take your cat to the vet your cat is not going to be associating that carrier with experiences that make them anxious and despite routine it's very easy to teach your cat it's also very helpful in cats that have already advanced training skills before going on a walk with your cat if you ask your cat to sit and stay they're going to learn that before going out they need to sit stay and wait for the harness to be on this way you're going to prevent door dashing another routine that you can teach a cat that has advanced training skills it's to sit and stay for their food if you ask your cat to wait on a

(Start: 00:02:03)
particular area every time that you feed them you're going to see that your cat goes to that particular area on their own when they want you to feed them preventing them from being on top of you when you're manipulating the can or silverware on the counter making it safer for them and for you i'm going to go from level 1 to level 7 in about 10 minutes if you think you need more time and you would like to have a one-on-one conversation consider checking our patreon account where members have the option to engage in one-on-one conversations with us to answer their questions level two luring from here onwards the training is going to be intentional we're going to be using a form of operant conditioning which is clicker training clicker training is a form of reinforcement that leverage the fact that behaviors that are rewarded are more likely to be repeated if you don't know what clicker training is and you would like to learn take a look at this video where i explain what clicker training is and in three very easy steps how to teach it to your cat the easiest trick that we can purposefully teach our cat is luring luring uses food to help your cat do the behavior that you want them to do by following the food are you

(Start: 00:03:03)
familiar with the image of a donkey following a carrot that's slurring finger targeting is also a form of luring you place a treat between your finger and your thumb and you move your index finger up and down your cat is going to go for the treat that's between my thumb and my index finger but they are also going to learn that if there's an index finger going up and down they're going to get a treat you can use luring to teach your cat to come when cold you will find the videos of the tricks that i'm talking about in this video in the description box down below so i don't need to point to the ceiling every two minutes level three it's luring and marking level three consists of tricks that leverage luring to get your cat to do something and then marking the behavior when it happens i really recommend the clicker for training but that's a topic for another day if you don't have a clicker don't worry you can use the word yes or good to train your cat examples of luring and marking are sit or spin to teach your cat to sit you're going to place a treat above their head at some point they're not going to be able to look further up

(Start: 00:04:04)
and in order to continue following the treat with their eyes they're going to sit when they sit you click then reward to teach a cat to spin the process is very similar you will grab the treat and you will move the tree around your cat your cat is going to follow the treat and at some point they're going to complete a spin at that time you click then reward level 4 shaping shaping is the easiest way to teach advanced tricks and i have a full video talking about it this video is so important that you can find the link here but it will also be in the description box down below shaping consists on separating a very difficult trick into smaller problems and the combination of all these little problems will get your cat to the final trick that you want them to think of it like a bachata class you start with the easy steps and you add some movement during the class and at the end of the class you are able to do the whole choreography okay i do not dance vegeta so i have no idea what i'm talking about but i guess they do it that way for example to teach a cat to jump through your arms you cannot just put your arms

(Start: 00:05:06)
here and be like hey jump so we're going to separate this into a smaller problem we're going to first put our arm on the floor maybe towards something and we're just going to get our cat going over it using finger target when the cat knows this behavior we can raise the arm just a little bit high enough so that it makes it more difficult but not too high so that they can go underneath next step could be okay i will just add the arm on top but i'm not going to make them jump yet when they already know how to go through your arms when your arm is fairly low you can start raising your arms up and your cat is going to continue jumping through your arms as you ask them same thing goes to get your cat to jump on your shoulder come on good girl this video is also available in the description box down below level 5 it's all about stopping impulses the most difficult things in this world is to compete with your cat's willingness to do something else you sometimes want to stop your cat from getting too close to a dangerous situation where you want them to stop

(Start: 00:06:07)
getting their nose on the food while you're preparing it teaching your cat to wait for a release command will help you prepare the food without them clawing at you and running the risk of getting hurt with a can for instance teaching your cat to sit and stay will even help you take better pictures of your cat you start by asking your cat to sit then you ask them to stay you do the hand gesture and you reward them immediately you know what they're funny this works because they don't know what you're rewarding them for you're rewarding them for doing nothing and that's exactly what you're looking for repeat the process and take a little longer every time before you reward you ask them to sit you ask them to stay wait a second good and then reward after a few repetitions your cat is going to learn that doing nothing is exactly the behavior that's getting them the reward and you might be wondering so why is this trick difficult because as soon as you add competing stimuli as soon as you add something that your cat wants to do instead of waiting then it's when it gets hard you're going to continue doing the same with a competing stimuli maybe

(Start: 00:07:08)
a bowl of food right next to you when your cat moves you say nope you grab the food and you take it away you ask them to sit you ask them to stay you place the competing stimuli until they wait for the time that you're working on how do you teach them the release command and once they know to see them stay you can teach them the release command you can say go ahead and put the food closer to them encouraging them to go any at the beginning you're going to say go ahead get the food very close to them and with time you're going to see that keeping the food further and further they know that they can go and get that food anyways level 6 is the sensitization is not only hard to teach it also takes time desensitization is the process of getting a cat that's scared about something or fearful about a situation you stop considering as threatening or fearful the way to do it is by repetition of the small good experiences that are going to build towards the situation that we're trying to desensitize for instance if your cat is scared of the carrier because we've been using it exclusively to go into the

(Start: 00:08:09)
bed which now you know it's something that you should not do we can use the sensitization to eliminate the fear towards a carrier start by placing the carrier outside where they can see it in days that you don't need to go to the bed place food inside the carrier so that your cat considers getting inside to getting that food if they get inside on their own reward it make that experience even a more positive one when you're playing with your cat use the carrier as one element more amongst the ones that you like playing with then consider closing the carrier and moving the carrier around your house when they get inside on their own always rewarding afterwards when a cat that was fearful about the carrier starts getting inside the carrier on their own means that we have successfully desensitized the fear towards the carrier level seven competing stimuli training a cat for obedience is a lot easier than most people think indoors training obedience when there's competing stimuli it's a whole different story as i've said before competing stimuli are reinforcers that are competing with the reinforcer that you're using which is food a bird is going to win over your dry treats 90

(Start: 00:09:11)
of the time albert is actually going to win over your freeze-dried chicken but i can assure you that the first thing that you can do to try to win over competing stimuli is to have the strongest reinforcer possible and having high quality treats really helps the second thing that's gonna help you against competing stimuli is repetition if you can get your cat to internalize a behavior to a point that they don't think when you ask it you're going to be able to get that behavior even if there's competing stimuli around mia has learned that every time i call her she gets her favorite treat she's built such a strong reaction to come when cole that even with competing stimuli around she comes 70 or 80 percent of the time which makes my life very easy when i'm outdoors or i want to go to bed the more anti-natural that the behavior is to a cat the more difficult it's going to be to teach it to them teaching a cat tricks should come from our willingness to enrich their lives not as a selfish interest to bending them to our will any cat regardless of their age or breed can

once you've got the harness in your home you can check if the harness is the right size by placing two fingers between the harness and the cat if you cannot place two fingers between the harness and the cat it's probably too small if you can feel more than two three fingers it's probably a little too big the sensitizing the harness presence whenever you weigh something for your cat unless it's candid it's going to take a while for your cat to get used to the smell of that object that toy cats use pheromones to mark objects and areas as safe place the harness in areas that your cat likes hanging on so they can soak it with their pheromones once the harness smells a little bit more like your cat and a little less like factories and dice your cat is going to be more comfortable wearing it putting the harness on your cat there's only one right way to put a harness on a cat which is using sit and stay [Music]

they believed that the training methods at the time were being very inefficient because there was way too much time between the moment where the animal was doing the behavior and the praise or reward that was happening because of it for instance imagine you're training your cat to sit you approach them with food or with your hand to praise them or reward them by the time that you arrive to your cat your cat has moved 20 000 times and by the time that you reward them they're not going to know what are you rewarding them for there's just too much going on between the moment that they sit and the moment they receive the reward for having said it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of repetitions for the animal to understand that what it's being recorded it's the act of sitting so bf skinner and these two students coined the term bridging stimulus bridging stimulus came to life in 1940 and basically it's the introduction of a secondary reinforcer to bridge the gap between the behavior that we want to see repeated and the reward for that behavior the secondary

reinforcers receive the name of markers because they mark the behavior that you want to see repeated in the future but more on this later to keep it very simple because we could be talking about these four days annivel behavior is shaped by five big motivators eat not be eaten produce offsprings more of the good stuff less of the bad stuff and subscribing to this channel okay maybe not the last one but subscribe and hit the bell button to get notified when the next video is up all behavior happens because the animal is trying to fulfill one of these five motivators and if you think about it which is the motivator that you have easiest access to you said it food when using overend conditioning to encourage animal behavior we're going to use food as a primary reinforcer to achieve one of these three things capturing a behavior we are going to reward the animal in the act of doing something that we want to see more often behaviors that are

rewarded are more likely to be repeated in the future so by rewarding an animal that's doing something that we like we're going to encourage that behavior happening again luring use the treat as a magnet to lure the animal to a position or a location that you want one very easy example to understand luring it's the donkey and the carrot and finally shaping behavior gradually building towards the desired behavior by creating smaller games and rewarding each step along the way one example of shaping behavior is shoulder training or riding on a bike with your cat from easy to difficult capturing is the easiest way to train an animal then it's luring and finally shaping the basis of effective clicker training is to deliver the reinforcer at the same time that the behavior happens and we have primary reinforcers and secondary or conditioned reinforcer the clicker or conditioned reinforcer it's previously a neutral

stimulus meaning that there's no perceived value attached to the clicker sound itself when you first receive your clicker from amazon or from your local store the sound of the clicker is going to be useless until you charge it [Music] charging the clicker it's the name for pairing the primary reinforcer food with the sound of the clicker secondary or conditioned reinforcer when we pair the clicker with the foot the secondary reinforcer acquires the same reinforcement properties as the primary reinforcer the foot the click becomes a reinforcer on its own money is to humans a conditioned reinforcer despite the paper bills are not reinforcers on their own they can be used to acquire primary reinforcers such as food water or shelter and therefore money becomes a reinforcer on its own people love money don't they so how do you pair the clicker with the food i'm glad you asked by the way if you have any questions you

(Start: 00:05:05)
can write them down in the comments section the process of pairing the clicker with food is called charging the clicker and charging the clicker is achieved by repetition cats only learn on a relaxed state so if you're clicking at the same time that you're delivering the food your cat won't be able to build the connection between the clicker and the reward you have to first click then reward click then reward after a few repetitions the animal is going to understand and after a click comes a reward an easy way to know if the clicker is charged is because after the click your animal is going to be looking for the reward for impert animals that cannot hear the clicker a light or a gesture can serve as markers if you don't have access to a clicker you can also use a verbal command like yes or good yes clicker training works for cats actually any animal can learn new behaviors using clicker training but in this channel we are all about training cats and doing more and better with our furry friends we have dozens of

Title: The Surprising Truth Behind Fat Cats

(Start: 00:00:00)
did you know that the majority of cats in the u.s are overweight or obese 59.5 to be exact to make matters worse the number of obese cats it's on the rise in 2018 it was a 33.8 five years earlier in 2013 it was only 27.4 the problem it stopped on one hand we have cats that are fat or obese and should lose weight otherwise they can develop health issues on the other hand using the wrong diet can even kill your cat because they are very bad at synthesizing fat they want to help you understand if your cat is fat and in the case that they are fat what to do about it so the other day i posted a video on instagram it basically showcases mia and i asked her are you hungry and she meows it's like are you hungry meow okay and then i feed her and the video received a ton of comments of people saying my cat is always hungry my cat eats too much my cat is chubby and the problem is that even some people like cats being with and that can have health as well as well-being implications for the cat as

(Start: 00:01:00)
always i sat in my computer and i started doing some research and i saw this study from the pet obesity association that says that 68 of cat parents are trying to do something about their cats obesity i guess that if you're watching this video you're one of them if your cat is one of those 59.5 of cats that are overweight and you're one of the 68 of cat guardians that want to do something about it i got your bag let's start from the beginning how can you know if your cat is fat and that's the beginning but it's only half of the battle the ideal weight for an average adult cat is between 8 pounds and 15 pounds but without considering the size of your cat these numbers are a little bit irrelevant some breeds are going to be larger than others and males for instance are also larger than females so male cats and larger breeds are naturally going to weight more so if we cannot use absolute body weight what are the best ways to know if our cat is overweight or fat in the case that you are new to the channel this is my academy and i'm going to collaborate with her to help you understand if your cat is fat there are five very easy ways to identify if your cat is overweight

(Start: 00:02:02)
the third view when looking at your cat from above you should be able to see a slight narrowing around their waist area if their sights bulge out instead your cat might be on the tubby side as you can see with mia she has a slight narrowing but it's pretty much straight so that would be telling me that she might be slightly overweight the ribs check when you bet your cat around the sides right under the front paws you should be able to feel the ribs without pressing too much for a healthy cut the rib cage padding should not feel any thicker than the top of your hand this is according to the veterinary center of cummings if you have to press very firmly to feel the ribs this means that your cat might be slightly overweight i know that at this point with these two tricks already you want to stand up and go check it on your cat and that's okay but before you stand up from your computer or get away from your phone to go find your cat make sure you hit that like button because once you start

petting your cat you're going to forget about me and i think that so far we already deserved that like right okay also by hitting the like button you're also helping yourself because you're telling the youtube algorithm that you like this content and that you want to see more videos like this one it's not only me it's every cat parent teaching you cool stuff about cat so hit the like button and let the youtube algorithm serve you all the content that you want to watch in the case of mia the rib case test is the one that is providing the worst results for mia and it shows that she might be slightly overweight i have to press a little bit to fill those reps which means that she might be on the heavy side with cats that have long hair this test is going to be slightly more difficult to perform so make sure that your fingers are getting through all the hair layer before trying to get the ribs because otherwise you're going to think that your cat is fat and that might not necessarily be the case the activity test with the

exception of geriatric cats healthy cats that are on a healthy weight should enjoy playing and chasing things around the house cats are naturally very active and cats that are on their proper way should display that kind of behavior mia is very active and always ready to play so despite she might be on the heavy side she still has a healthy weight that allows her to do all the normal activities that a cat should be doing the watermelon trick if your cat looks like a watermelon your cat is overweight and if your cat looks like a watermelon please go visit the vet because you should do something about it okay that was a very bad joke i am sorry there's one last way that you can use to see if your cat is overweight which is the body mass index calculation there's one website omnicalculation.com i'm going to be adding the link in the description box down below if you go to the website they're going to ask you a bunch of questions about your cat in terms of dimensions they're going to ask you the weight and they have an algorithm that's going to calculate what's the body index

(Start: 00:05:05)
for your cat that website is also very good at helping you understand how to interpret the numbers that it's going to give you the main problem with obese cats is that they can develop diabetes this is no good and this is only one of the multiple health complications that an obvious cat can experience it's worthwhile to mention that we can make some allowances for older cats is that slight overwhelm can even help them stay healthy in the case that they develop kidney disease which is fairly common about 30 percent of cats will develop it in their geriatric stage cats with kidney disease will have problems maintaining their weight so being slightly overweight as they get to the geriatric stage can help them stay healthy in the case that they develop the disease for every other cat if your cat is part of the 59.5 of the cat population that is overweight watch until the end of the video because i am going to share with you all the things that you can do to get your cat back in shape and hitting a proper healthy way creating high quality content that is useful for you takes a

lot of my free time if you want to join the facebook group if you want to discuss anything and everything with me while supporting the channel click on the link join our patreon community i would really really appreciate that now that you know if your cat is overweight the number one thing that you need to do is visit the veterinarian there are several medical conditions that can cause a cat to become overweight if your cat has an underlying health condition that it's provoking they're overweight the only way to know about it and to really solve the overweight issue and the health issue is to visit a veteran area if there are no medical conditions lack of exercise or excessive food are the only two reasons why your cat might be becoming overweight simply put your cat is gaining weight because they are eating more calories than the ones that they are able to burn and i don't want to offend anyone but if your cat is overweight it is your fault you are the cat wardian and you are the only person providing food and exercise to your cat i am not ready to see all the comments

(Start: 00:07:06)
roasting me for having said this um but this is youtube i guess it's going to happen so go at it now that you have released your fury in the comment section let's see what you might be doing wrong and what you can do to help your cat get to a healthy weight most cats eat way too many calories an indoor cat in average should be eating around 20 calories per pound of body weight and an outdoor cat should be eating about 35 calories per pound of body weight for everyone that's not in the u.s it's more or less around 40 calories per kilogram so you basically take your cat's weight and you multiply per the amount of calories and you should get a number between 180 calories per day and 250 calories per day it is recommended that all non-breathing cats are sterilized mainly for health reasons first spaying your cat will eliminate the risk of ovarian and uterine cancer second breast cancer is the number one cancer diagnosed to intact female cats but one side effect

(Start: 00:08:07)
of spaying your cat is that it will decrease their metabolism causing a more sedentary lifestyle this will likely turn into your cat gaining weight if we don't adapt their calorie intake every time i mention anything about spain cats i receive a thousand questions talking about should i spay marquette what are the implications of spaying my cat this is just a reminder to subscribe and hit the bell button to get notified when the video is up it's in the works it's not ready yet but it's coming so how do we control how much are we feeding our cats the first thing that we need to do is to stop free feeding if you have been following this channel for a bit you know that in every other video i see that you should not free feed your cat but in the case that you're new welcome what is pre-feeding profiting is having a bowl of food always available for them it doesn't matter if it's wet food or it's dry food if your cat can always go and munch a little bit of food that is free feeding and that is what you want to stop free feeding will not only make your cat chubby it's also going to affect your bond with them and affect

the ability you have to train them the second biggest mistake i see in most of the cats that i work with are the commercial treats toss them away and your cat should not go after them treats are for cats like snacks are for us a colorful crunchy flavorful experience that will come with no nutritional value that is going to release a quick dopamine fix got a dopamine rush gotta majorly crush when you're next to me i know that you're giving your cat treats because you love them but there are treats and treats what i'm trying to say is that there are healthier treats than others i personally use freeze dried chicken which is basically hundred percent chicken breast this will allow your cat to get a treaty love that doesn't come with all those unnecessary calories if your cat will only eat the treat that you're already buying and you don't want to change the tree my recommendation is that you get those treats and you cut them into smaller pieces but it's not all about quantity sometimes it's about quality most cat

food has way too much carbs even those marked as grain free there's this correlation between obese cats and cats that are eating dry food most overweight cats happen to be on a dry diet and this is no coincidence dry food has the lowest nutritional value per calorie due to the fact that they contain a lot of carbs cats are designed to hunt and in the wild natural prey of cats contain about 55 percent of protein 45 percent of fat and only one to two percent of carbs dry food on the contrary contains between 20 to fifty percent carbohydrates if cats only need one to two percent of carbohydrates why does dry food provide almost fifty percent of their diet in this kind of nutrients according to dr lisa pearson cats have no dietary need for carbohydrate even worse it can be detrimental for their health this is why i transition to raw food transitioning to raw meat it's not

(Start: 00:11:10)
for every cat it's not for every cat parent it comes with pros and cons that you need to be aware of if you don't feel like transitioning to raw food yet it's okay moving to a wet or canned diet it's already going to be a massive improvement versus dry food in the wild cats are not overweight and their body is very bad at transforming fat into energy if a cat that has a lot of fat accumulated in their body stops receiving the proper amount of food they're going to try to transform this fat into energy and this can cause infiltration of fat in the liver putting too much stress on the liver can develop into hepatic lipidosis and even produce liver failure if the liver is unable to get rid of all that fatty content so making it very plain and simple if you drastically reduce the amount of food you're feeding your cat and your cat is overweight you can produce liver failure and kill your cat so don't do it without speaking with a veterinarian outdoor cats are going to run around and try to hunt for their food and that it's going to make them burn a lot more calories

(Start: 00:12:11)
than in their cats because you're in their cat it's not hunting for their food right after killing their prey cats will have to quickly eat that meal before another bigger predator comes and steals it from them or before they become prey themselves because it's not everything about eating it's also about not getting eaten this instinct will cause indoor cats to eat very fast and not because they are scared it's because they are programmed to do so also because they don't have to go through bones and skin they're going to chug that food way faster than they would in a natural environment it usually takes around 20 to 30 minutes for your cat's stomach to close after starting a meal this means that if your cat takes only five minutes to eat a meal they're going to spend the other 25 minutes thinking that they are hungry despite they've had a normal meal playing with our cats before their meals is going to stimulate this chase skill eat dynamic that they face in the wild adding a little water in their food it's also going to help them feel more full and it's going to take slightly longer to eat that meal i myself try to drink a

glass of water before every meal so that i don't use that space to eat ice cream if you don't have time to play with your cat or your cat is so grumpy because they are hungry that they are not going to play with you you can use footballs and food puzzles to slow down your cat i'll add the links to the ones that i use in the description box down below we said earlier that there are two things making your cat overweight one eating too many calories two not doing enough exercise let's talk about the second one exercising cats can come from enriching environments playtime or going outdoors make sure you offer your cat places to run climb and scratch you live in a small apartment vertical space will give your cat a lot of enrichment without taking too much of space that you also need playing with your cat is not only going to help you keep their health and weight under control it's also going to be a great opportunity for you to bond with them i cannot stress enough how important it is for you to play with your cat both for the health implications as well as for the bonding

Title: Should You Walk Your Cat on a Leash?

(Start: 00:00:00)
so last month i was in barcelona i went to visit my mom and i was walking my cat mia when someone yelled at us that got stuck in my head and it had me thinking should we really walk our cats comparaton pero came back to my head when i was taking a shower later when i was cooking dinner and finally before i went to bed and i decided i had to do something about it i sat down in my computer and i did what almost everybody would do i looked in google whether we should be walking or cats or not and there's some welfare animal charities as well as some veterinarians that are advising against this is because walking our cats outdoors exposes our cats to unfamiliar experiences and potential threats also for cats that are not used to being outdoors it can become a very stressful situation those google search results were going against what i've seen happening with my cat mia because when she's outdoors she's the happiest cat in the world so i decided to make a list with pros and cons of walking your cat when i finish the list if the cons are greater than the pros i am going to stop walking my cat mia on a leash if nato wanted cats to stay indoors it

would have equipped them with sandals not more of their meetings cats are fully awake and alive when they are outdoors it's similar to what happens when we are doing something that we are passionate about when cats are outside or walking on a leash you can really see their instincts turned on speaking of which do you know what turns me on that you hit that like button so that this video reaches more people offering our cats mental and physical stimulation it's part of the responsibilities of being a cat guardian and walking or cat on a leash can be a great way to do so this is the number one reason why i walk my cadmium for guys that are not used to the road noises dog sparking or the smells of the outside world being exposed to it without any acclimation can easily become overwhelming i want to imagine that the reason why you want to take your cat outdoors is to make your cat happier and that you are going to take all the steps needed to make your cat being comfortable outdoors but for the sake of this exercise i'm going to consider this a con the fact that your cat gets overwhelmed when you try to take them outdoors it's not an indication that you cannot walk your cat

(Start: 00:02:02)
on a leash it is an indicator to starting slow and expanding the territory as they get more comfortable stretch the exploring inside your cat to new experiences very gently don't force them to do more than one they want to tackle on any given day if the past weekend they went this far and this weekend they just can go until here keep it here make every experience short and sweet so that they want to go out again if you don't know whether your cat is ready or not i've created an adventure cat readiness test write down your email and i'll send the text straight to your inbox the test it's free and it will help you understand where your cat is at and if you need to take any steps prior to going outdoors with them cats are preyed upon by larger animals such as off-leash dogs coyotes foxes some birds like hawks and owls and even elephants okay maybe not the elephant there are also flea antiques outdoors that can be a threat to your cat as well as your family i remember vividly removing ticks of my friend's body as

(Start: 00:03:03)
well as myself after a beach walk with our cats this past summer each of us had dozens of ticks but luckily we found none on our cats this is because we were using a very good teak and flea prevention product i was using over-the-counter products but every time i was going to the veterinarian they were recommending revolution and i decided to give it a try the other two beautiful things about revolution is that it lasts a month and if our cats leak when we apply it it's not toxic for them unlike all the on the contour products that we can find this product cannot be bought on amazon you will have to speak with your vet but if you speak with your vet most likely they have it available because it's the number one tick prevention system that veterinarians recommend and i know that this is something like a sponsored video but it is not i am getting zero dollars for recommending you this product it's only a product that i use and that i love that turned out to be very effective that day on the beach so hit the like button to thank me for this great advice yes there are risks when going outdoors there's nothing safer

than staying at home on the sofa but it's a life locked down a life worth living we've experienced that ourselves during the pandemic by being outdoors in situations that are stimulating your cat creates a positive association between you and the outdoors when uncertainty or stress happens your cat will rely on you to protect them this will strengthen the bond between you and your cat as they will seek shelter and protection on you developing the bond and the trust with my cat mia it's invaluable for me and going outdoors has really enabled it for us cats have a ton of energy sometimes we play with our cats and it feels like there's no way we can drain all their energy if you're interested in knowing what are the best ways to play with your cat take a look at this video here but when that doesn't seem to work walking or cat on a leash is one of the best ways to drain our cats energy they will stalk chase and bounce around until their energy is gone some of the most cozy evenings i've had with mia were after long hikes where mia had the opportunity to unwind drain all her energy and when me is very tired she

usually seeks for a safe spot where she can take a deep rest and usually i'm the winner for that so she sits next to me and we spend some nice time together many cats will go into on-demand mode when they get used to being outdoors they will vocalize and howl as loud as possible their expectations that they want to be let out sometimes they will run from window to window and others will keep an eye out for any door that's open any window that's available to crack it open and dash outside this is just proof of how enriching and how valuable being outdoors is for our cats but it doesn't make it less annoying or less dangerous to prevent our cats from howling darting or dashing through the door positive reinforcement and routine are going to be our best friends try to take your cat out consistently you pick it once a month once a week once a day once every morning like i don't care but pick a routine and stick to it by doing this your cat will learn when to expect to be let out and will minimize the risk of them trying to achieve that on their own also create a routine when you put

should you not walk your cat because of society's expectations of course not you can't walk a cat like you walk a dog cats will often be slower and stop and sniff around this means that you won't be able to go very far or cover much ground but again we are not doing this for us we are doing this for our cats so take it easy and let them enjoy the experience if you like hiking if you want to go far go out equipped with a backpack with some patience and treats you should be able to do almost any height for long treks don't forget your cat's food and your cat's water they get dehydrated faster than humans and sometimes it might be hard to get in them to drink so try to bring wet food instead of kibble when you go out with them the thing is that while cats do love to explore they do so in a very different way than dogs not all cats have outdoor predisposition particularly cats that are old and have never done it before so it should be decided on a cat by cat basis no one knows your cat better than you but there's only one way to know for sure don't walk your cat on

operant conditioning the conditioning happens because behaviors that are rewarded are more likely to be repeated by rewarding your cat for the behaviors that you want you're encouraging your cat to doing them again so how do you tell your cat that they did something that you want and it's going to be rewarded using a clicker clicker it's nothing more than a noisemaker which noise we're going to associate with a reward once again understands that after a click comes a reward the click itself becomes a very strong reinforcer i won't be using the clicker today so that the noise doesn't distract your cat in the case that you have already charged to your clicker instead every time that you would hear the sound click you're going to hear a camera shutter it is also a great way to remind you that we click in the instant that we see the action that we want to see more often just like we would do with a camera we snapshot that moment when the cat is doing the thing that we want to see more often the process of priming our cats with the knowledge that after a click comes a reward it's called charging clicker we're going to make a click then rewards after doing this several times we're

going to see how our cat starts expecting a treat right after the click when that happens you can officially say that your clicker is charged every time i post a new video about clicker training cads i get the same question is the clicker needed can we train a cat if we don't have a clicker the answer to this question is very simple yes you can train a cat without a clicker the objective of the clicker is nothing more than making a noise that will let our can know that that behavior it's going to be rewarded the clicker is my favorite way of marking behaviors for two main reasons first reason is because this noise it's unique and you're never going to hear a noise like this one outside the training session so our cats are not going to get confused by it the second reason is because the noise it's constant it's always going to make the same noise no matter how many times you use the clicker this way it's very easy for our cat to understand that the noise that they are hearing is coming from the clicker and it's marking a behavior that it's going to be rewarded my recommendation is that you get a clicker they cost five dollars or less they are

available on amazon and in every single pet store across the globe if you don't know which one to buy i'm going to be adding the link to the one that i use in the description box down below if you don't want to use a clicker no problem you can use yes or good order whatever works for you but again remember it has to be a noise that only happens during training sessions and it has to always sound the same for our cat to not get confused wow this was a lot but let's assume that now you know what clicker training is you have charged your clicker and we can get started with the trick if you need more information about how clicker training works i've added a link in the description box down below teaching how to click or train your cat in three simple steps this trick is easier to teach if your cat knows how to sit if you don't know how to teach your cat to sit you can take a look at this video here step one get your cat on a sitting position with your cat sitting take a treat and place it in the palm of your hand holding it with your index finger as soon as your cat leaves the paw to go for the treat that you are holding on your hand click or say yes and reward

(Start: 00:04:05)
after with a few repetitions you're going to see that your cat gets closer and closer to your hand even to the point that it touches it when your cat touches your hand for the first time click and reward generously now it's time to start repeating it over and over to get your cat internalizing the movement as you start doing those repetitions you can start saying high five high five high five with only a few repetitions more your cat is going to go to touch your hand as soon as you raise it it's time to move to the next step we were doing the high five with a treat in our hand and holding the treat with our index finger now we're going to do the same but we're going to remove the tree and we're going to do it without any treat but we're going to continue doing the same gesture point the center of your hand with your index finger and say high five if the prior behavior was internalized you're going to see that your cat doesn't really care if there's a treat or not in your hand they're still going to go and touch it keep saying high five as you leave the hand and keep clicking and rewarding as soon as they touch it with a few more repetitions the behavior without a treat it's going to get internalized at that time you can remove your hand and keep

(Start: 00:05:08)
doing the same saying high five offering your hand to your cat and as soon as your cat touches the hand you click and reward i promise you a couple tricks to get clicker training a little easier use a high value tree a treat that your cat loves and use it only for clicker training make the trees as tiny as possible because the stomach is very small think of the size of a walnut because we're using food as a reinforcer we need our cats to stay motivated by the treats that we're giving them if we feed them big chunks they're going to be full in no time and our sessions are going to last only a couple minutes some cats get scared with the sound of a clicker if that's the case of your cat place the clicker behind your back it's going to protect them from the loud noise super close to their face but nothing of what i said before makes any sense if you're doing one of these five mistakes to fast track your clicker training take a look at this video where i share five do's and five stones that are going to make your training three times as fast stay wild stay safe see your doors

it's so easy to enter the bermuda triangle of punishment and by the way i think i just coined this word your gut is something that you don't want them to do you punish them because you don't want them to do that but it creates anxiety and that anxiety will make your cat do things that you don't want them to do and there you go another cat lost to the bermuda triangle the process to stop your cat from engaging in negative behaviors has three steps understand what is causing the behavior offer an alternative and reward when they use the alternative instead of the unwanted behavior i have a full playlist talking about unwanted behavior chewing on plants jumping on the counter scratching and biting you can check more about it clicking in the link here we have reviewed some of the things that you have to stop doing if you want to get your cat to trust you now let's go through the things that you should start doing instead play regularly and often with your cat catchers are socializing as kitties with play they learn to trust each other to define boundaries and to interact in a meaningful manner thanks

one of the things that i get asked the most is if a cat above a certain age or of a certain breed can go on adventures or even learn clicker training not all cats have the same predisposition to go on adventures so i've created a test to help you understand if your cat is an adventure cat and if not to help you find opportunities to introduce them to the lifestyle story time it's 1965. there's this harvard psychologist leonardo jacobson and robert rosenthal they basically approach this elementary school in california and are like hey we've got this test that we can give you guys that it's going to help you identify the specialties the awesome kids the kids that are going to do amazing things they are going to be genius we call them the intellectual bloopers so the school agrees students did not know that they were getting tested but the teachers did harvard professors shared the results with the school you have the special kids and the average kids the psychologists went back a year later and what they found out is the results were incredibly accurate the special kids blew the average kids out

very invested cat lovers that want to go on adventures with their cat by a bengal cat they put a lot of love and effort to make it happen the cat loves it because let's be honest most cats will love being outdoors and there you go another bengal cat feeding the pygmalion effect every cat regardless of the age and breed can enjoy outdoors and learn clicker training and i know you're going to say but albert my cat does this and does that which proves that they don't like the outdoors and you will be right not all cats have the same predisposition to go on adventures so i've created a test to help you understand if your cat is an adventure cat and if not to help you find opportunities to introduce them to the lifestyle i call it the seriously unscientific and borderline silly cat readiness into bucolic escapes test oh and this reminds me of something if you want to take the bone with your cat to the next level consider subscribing i am uploading weekly content to do more and better with your cat mia i need you to complete this test for me okay i'll do it for you the test will assess your

if you give your cat always indoors and once a year you grab your cat you shove it in a carrier to take them to the bed where they can smell dogs other cats and meet someone on a blue coat that starts manipulating them without any permission I can assure you that your cat it's not going to like leaving your home by any circumstance not even if you're taking them to Disneyland cats can get really anxious when riding on a car they will meow the whole time and some might even urinate themselves it becomes kind of a tragic event that will just lead to more anxiety and frustration for future trips when Mia came to my life in August 2020 I was dating Jasmine a super smart woman that did not like cats all that much we had a two weeks road trip planned for that same summer and meal was only 12 weeks old canceling the road trip because of a cat would have broken the relationship and not taking meal with me would imply that almost one-fourth of Mia's life at the time would have been spent with someone that was not me which is not a for bonding yes I am going to

that happen inside it in the allegory of the cave Plato describes a group of people that have been living facing a wall inside a cave all their life these people could see nothing but shadows in the world that was in front of them created by people passing by between a fire and themselves Plateau defends that the Shadows have become the reality for these people because they have never seen anything else they have no ability to understand that what they are seeing reflected on the wall are just the shadows of things that are happening behind them the people the noises and the smells inside your home become your cat's reality the best thing we can do is incorporate and known situations very early on so other people other noises other animals or even the car become part of your cat's new reality despite it's going to be easier to desensitize the kitty to getting used to riding on a car or being out and about the steps to achieve it are the same for adult cats and for kittens the best way to think about it is dividing the process in three stages getting your cat ready getting your car ready and ensuring is smooth ride I will add timestamps in the

(Start: 00:04:05)
where usually Mia hangs out she was just the normal life and impregnate all those towels with her smell then before the road trip I would grab the towels and place them on the camper van I was also going to take some catnip and place it on the floor and on the back seats of the car but I could do that on my arrival getting my cat Mia ready was going to be a little bit more tedious you have never been on a car before and I did not want to get her for the first time inside the car during a two-week road trip I started taking Mia for sure walks inside the carrier within my apartment I'd lure her inside the carrier and reward move the carrier stop and reward if the carrier put the carrier down and reward it's important to reward your cat once the carrier has a stop the movement is the anticipation of a reward that's coming a little bit like the marking that we do with a clicker also rewarding your cat while you're moving them it's going to make it hard for them to understand what exactly you're rewarding once I got me a used so they care I decided to take her on a short ride somewhere I grabbed all that that was that I had previously impregnated with her smell and rented a

(Start: 00:06:08)
little Dusty and Mia was not used to it so the risk of using those was stole my cat Mia not identifying the leader and deciding to do her things elsewhere and in the case that she decided to use it the locality leader would be tracing and dusting all around the car that we were supposed to ride for long hours eat and sleep for two weeks the options that worked best for us was to have a bunch of disposable foil trays the ones that you can buy to use in the oven and our preferred leader the beauty about the Disposable tray is that you don't have to clean it and because it's made of aluminum foil every week when we had to change the litter we would just grab the foil and throw it away there are fancier options made with cloth that have even a zipper on them they are amazing for one day trips or if you're staying at hotels but when you're going to be on the road for two weeks you don't want to be dealing with cleaning litter boxes we put some litter inside the foils and put those trays on the floor on the back seat as soon as male would use it we would clean the tray to prevent others from staying inside the car we would put it inside the back and then that back inside another bag and then that back inside another bag and then that back inside another bag and then back inside another bag as soon as we had a chance

(Start: 00:07:09)
we would dump it if your cat is least trained or you have the ability to train your cat to walk on a leash I would totally recommend it it makes a lot of sense to let your cat roam around whenever you make a stop it's going to help them unwind from the trip as well as getting them a little tired and increasing the chances that they're going to sleep during the next portion of the ride cat food this is an interesting one Mia is in a raw diet which implies Refrigeration because we were riding on a camper van we had a freezer for shorter rides I use an isothermal bag if you're going on a long trip an electric fridge it's advised the alternative is to get your cat used to dry food before the trip transitioning back to people has to be done slowly to prevent upsetting our cat's stomach but that's a topic for another day also don't forget to carry those minor things that can make your life way easier if things get messy for whatever reason paper towels wet wipes plastic bags and hand sanitizer some guts will hate the carrier if that's the case of your cat I would recommend you to have them on a harness and attach them either to the seat belt or have someone carrying them

(Start: 00:08:10)
on their lap make sure to check the local regulation I don't want you doing anything illegal cats will need to release some energy during the trip either by playing with them or walking them on a leash but having an hyper cat when you're on a road trip it's not a good idea because I work from home I had to teach my cat to play on command it's super helpful because it allows you to play with your cat whenever you have the time and not win their mood and instructions Force YouTube you can find more about it in this video here oh and by the way Jasmine and I broke before we even got to Utah we did not even finish the trip together so the moral of the story is yes you can go on a road trip with your cat no don't even try it don't date a person that doesn't like cats stay well stay safe see you Outdoors

as humans when we are bored we have at our disposal quick dopamine fixes our phones sugar netflix or any other form of creating a short burst of happiness for cats suffering from boredom is not that easy our feline friends need both physical and mental stimulation if they don't get it they can take things on their own paw and create their own fun which usually is not our own kind of fun but it goes beyond that cats that are bored can end up sad depressed or even having health issues been working from home since the beginning of the pandemic and this has allowed me to spend a lot of time with my cat mia but oftentimes she seeks for attention in the worst moment possible when i'm in an important meeting at work and i'm in front of the camera trying to explain people how important our job is or sometimes because i'm putting a lot of work and concentration on a very complex problem i knew that if i could get her to play in the moments where i had free time instead of on the moments that she was hyper i could increase my productivity like crazy my bosses started to realize

that something was off and they could even fire me you're fired if i was not increasing my productivity so i put myself to work to find a way to get her to play and burn some energy when i wanted and not when she was hyper on the process i also learned that playtime is the best to bond with our cats throughout the video i will be showing or mentioning toys that my cat mia loves but you don't need pen on paper because i'm going to add all the links to these products in the description box down below and also in the description box down below you're going to see time stamps so you can skip to the part of the video that you find more interesting play it's nothing more than challenging your domestic v-lines hunting instincts in ways that nature does something small and squeaky shoots across the floor they'll chase it first kind of toys that i tried were loose toys mice and balls that i could have around the house and mia could play with on her own i soon realized that mice and balls were of no value to me after laying around for a while i learned that toys have to be stored after they are used or otherwise they lose novelty and therefore they stop being prey and they start being

furniture i also learned that toys made out of hem rope are amazing for cats that like chewing things and that foil balls and balls with a rattle work best because cats are amazing at following sound something that i still do today is to have a bunch of foil balls sitting on my desk so that when mia comes looking for entertainment during my working hours i can just throw them away and hope that she's going to chase them and leave me alone for a few minutes so i can keep on working sometimes she will even go catch the toy and bring it back to me when mia started getting old she became more exquisite but don't we all the stories were no longer enough for her and i had to do something about it she had a lot of energy and i could not wear her out just by playing fetch i needed something else something better something technologically more advanced i got her a toy that was moving on her own she was unimpressed she played with it for a while and as it happened with the loose toys she lost interest it was too easy to anticipate and the erratic movements of the expensive toys were no match to me as hunting instincts there

(Start: 00:03:05)
are fancier better more expensive toys available out there but the last time that humans put robots into their homes it didn't end up well i was running out of options pressure at work was insane i needed to find a way to keep her busy or i would lose my job i was so stressed that i even built a shelf wall so that she could jump around you can see more of that in this video here just when all hope was lost i found it the play time that could change it all interactive play it's the play time where we interact with our cats it is not recommended to use hand or feet because it can trigger play aggression and that is a behavior that it's very difficult to correct in the future you can check this video here if you want to know more about it good interactive play are play sessions where we use ones and teasers to recreate natural behaviors that our cats would face in the wild i am a firm believer that there's nothing better than interacting with our cats during play time those toys usually have

(Start: 00:04:05)
feathers in one end and our arm in the other end note that different cats will enjoy hunting different prey so it's good to have a nice variety of feathers mice and worms also some cats like chasing fast movements around the floor and others like bouncing and jumping up in the air so having both ones and rods is advised to trigger your cat start making fast movements with the toys basically for as long as it takes for your cat to follow the toy with their head then land it to you in an area where your cat can still see it and start pulling it away until the toy disappears when your cat starts losing sight of the toy you're going to see that they start wiggling their ass you can stop moving the toy because there's a jump coming they are getting ready to bounce except for young kids most cats won't chase a toy for hours they will bounce try to kill and then rest when playing with your cat it's best to play for 10 15 minutes and then leave everybody a rest when your cat comes to you seeking for playtime again you can grab another toy and play for another 10 to 15 minutes

(Start: 00:05:05)
you will see that by allowing your cat to play and stop play and stop play and stop you're going to drain much more energy than if you try to engage with them for 20 or 30 minutes straight sometimes our cats are not super eager to play and we're tempted to use laser laser pointers are not necessarily bad for our cats but it's good to allow your cats to catch the prey that they are hunting when they play if you're using a laser pointer to drain your cat's energy make sure you transition to a physical toy before the end of the session this way you give your cat closure with the kill part of the game there's nothing like sink or cats go after real prey when unleashed despite we should not let our cats to kill any wild animal we can allow them to pounce and chase this is the best way it exists to drain our cat's energy have you considered going out with your cat on a leash it is easier than it seems and both you and your cat are going to spend more time together and on the wild so what's not to like about it to go

(Start: 00:06:06)
outdoors you will need harness a leash and for cats that have never been outside before there's going to be needed some desensitization because going outdoors with our cats can be very enriching but also very stressful if you're interested in walking your cat on a leash make sure you watch this video next stay safe stay wild see your doors

Title: Clicker Train Your Cat Faster avoiding these 5 MISTAKES
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSRXzcNuLzk

(Start: 00:00:00)
are you familiar with this if you are you're probably making one of the five mistakes that we're going to share in today's video have you ever felt like your cat is not food motivated or maybe your cat tries to reach to your hand when you're doing a command maybe your cat just gets distracted with everything and only pays attention to you when you have a treat in your hand if you said yes to any of these points or you feel like progress with your cat it's just lower than expected most likely you're making one of the five mistakes if you have a feeling that your cat doesn't understand clicker training and you find it difficult to teach your cat new tricks the mistake that you might be doing is that the clicker is not properly charged charging the clicker it's nothing more than priming your cat with the knowledge that after a click comes a reward it is a good idea to start the training sessions by charging the clicker it takes almost no time it's fun and it will make your sessions way smoother grab six or seven tricks get comfortable and start click and rewarding for no reason at all if your cat reaches to your hand while you're clicker training them even to the point that they scratch you and you have to

(Start: 00:01:01)
drop the treat of your hand and they eat it from the floor instead sometimes your cat just forgets that you're training them and goes directly for the back of treats you might be doing one of these two things wrong feeding them treats with the same hand that it's doing the command or feeding them with a good hand but directly to their mouth instead of dropping them on the floor i particularly like throwing the treats away from them because it's a way to tell your cat that the treats are coming far away from your back and far away from the hand that's making the signal also it allows your cat to unwind between exercises i was spending way too much money on treats for me and i wanted to make some diy myself hopefully they'll be ready before the video is over and i can tell you if mia likes them or not the next problem i often find are people claiming that their cats are not food motivated and while there's definitely the possibility it's not common there are two mistakes that might make it hard for your cat to be motivated by the trees that you're

(Start: 00:02:02)
giving them the first and most important of the two it's free feeding freefitting is to allow your cat to eat whenever they want in other words if there's always a bowl of food available for them to eat at any time that's pre-feeding not limiting the amount of food or the moments where your cat can eat it's not a very good idea if you're working hard to clicker train them free feeding impacts not only your cat's health but also your ability to motivate them with food as well as your ability to create a strong bond with them because we're going to use food as a reward when clicker training we want to control when our cat is eating so if you're free fitting your cat my recommendation needs to put your cat on a schedule i feed mia three to four times a day time between meals being between six to eight hours and i am aware that not everybody is at home sitting waiting for their cat meal time to come up if kobi doesn't have you locked inside your house and you're going to the office for work there are automatic feeders that can help you with that purpose i've found great automatic feeders both for

(Start: 00:03:04)
dry and wet food so if you don't know where to start you can find the links in the description box down below by filling your cat on a schedule you can strategically place the training sessions between meals by placing the training sessions close to the feeding time you're going to increase the food motivation of your cat as well as the appeal of the treats that you're giving them in the case that you're going to put your cat on a schedule because you're free feeding them currently it is important that during the transition period your cat eats enough food having a hungry cat it's never a good idea because cats are not designed to use energy stored in their fat reserves and their liver can get easily overwhelmed and you're going to ask me how much food should i feed them then because we don't want our cats to be hungry we're going to place a big bowl of food on the floor at the time that we've decided that it's going to be the fitting time call your cat and let them know that you're putting food down i personally like asking mia are you hungry and when she meows means that she's hungry and then i put the food down are you hungry okay

(Start: 00:04:05)
come on sit but i strategically do it at times when i want to put the food down after 10 to 15 minutes of the food being done you're going to see that your cat stops eating and at that time you can take the food and remove it from the floor you'll notice that they don't finish all the food that you put down so next meal use the amount they ate as a measure of how much food you should put down each meal let me go check the oven real quick looks like you should hit the like button but the treats are going to need another 10 minutes or so the second mistake that might have you feeling like your cat is not very food motivated are the treats that you are using i don't have chocolate at home because i crave it all the time if i have chocolate i keep going for the fridge for more chocolate it's to me are very strong motivated to go to the fridge cauliflower for instance doesn't produce the same effect if you

(Start: 00:05:07)
want to get your cat motivated you need to find those treats that your cat goes crazy for and i can tell you it's not chocolate chocolate it's toxic for cats because i've always fed mia either canned or raw meat i started clicker training using keyboard because for me it's unique it's different and for her kibble equals cookies however when i need me to be more focused because i'm teaching a complex tree or i'm outdoors i use freeze-dried chicken instead that's the one thing that meal will stop anything to go any i've added links to the products we use in the description box down below using treats for training can make your cats fat if you're going to buy treats like the ones that they sell in the supermarket streets make sure that you break them into smaller pieces because they are highly caloric and the last thing that we want is to overfeed our cats sometimes our cats are just not in the mood for training they are completely distracted and not even the treats that your cat craves are going to help them concentrate on the task just stop stop the training play

(Start: 00:06:07)
with your cat instead when your cat has way too much energy it doesn't make any sense to try to outpower that energy with trees it's better to drain some of your cat's energy and do the training session after that playing with a cat can be very fun but also very boring especially with older cats cats are ambush predators and they stalk in pounds to capture their prey when you are playing with your cat you will first need to trigger the curiosity and the hunting instinct with fast moves that will get your cat's eye when you notice that your cat is already following the toy with their eyes and their ears their whiskers are out and their pupils are starting to get big then it's time to let the prey sit and wait for your cat to pounce on it if you want to learn more about cat body language you can click the link here but they will also add the link in the description box down below you can alternate play them with throwing treats after a click to get your cat running after them without forgetting that they are within a training session i'm sure these tips

Title: The ONLY 3 Things You Need to Read Your Cat's Body Language

(Start: 00:00:00)
what's your cat trying to tell you what because we cannot use pheromones to communicate with our cats and marking our home with urine would be inappropriate today i want to talk about visual cues and cat body language to understand and communicate with our cats and stick with me because at the end of the video i'm going to share with you that one thing that will truly enable you to communicate with your cat throughout history cats have been seen by humans as mysterious hard-to-read self-centered creators that have either to be worshiped or vilified they look at you in the eyes and they stay in that position with no interest in doing anything but just looking at you and judging you we grow nervous we know that we need to do something but really don't know what why are god so hard to read nature design cats to be the ultimate hunter feral cats have a success rate of around 30 and make a kill about every 52 minutes they have a terrific night vision independently swiveling ears and a very good sense of smell they can even smell better than dogs there are bigger

(Start: 00:01:00)
faster and stronger animals in the environments where cats are originally from cats are prayed by larger predators this has made cats to adopt the run first ask questions later policy another consequence of being prey is that they have evolved to be very good at being quiet and hiding illness which are excellent self-protecting strategies because in the wild predators won't target them as easy prey well these are great adaptations for living in the wild it makes it for us cat guardian very difficult to decipher they are subtle and use communicating methods that greatly differ from ours their communication is basically visual and olfactory although sometimes they can also use the sound in the book decoding your cat link below they put it very nice if communication had a volume control humans would shout dogs would talk and cats would whisper because humans are not strong visual communicators i would recommend you to start reading from the body parts that are easier to read which are the body and tail and finalize the assessment with body parts that are harder to read

(Start: 00:02:00)
like whiskers eyes and ears and whenever we find contradicting hey come here good girl what do you want whenever we receive mixed signals the stay away part of the message prevails what can we learn from our cat's tales a straight up tale also known as flagpole happens when our cat is content happy and confident we will observe this behavior when a cat approaches another cat or a person in friendly attitude when the same upright tail offers a slight bend a question mark at the very end of the tip in addition to content and happy we have a cat that is playful it's a good moment to get a toy or a treat and help them spare some energy a puff tail means excitement and fear and it can happen during play sessions when they are extremely aroused but mostly it happens when they are scared in an attempt to look bigger in front of a threat that has suddenly come into play tail movement is an easy one to misread

(Start: 00:03:01)
if you've been around dogs a slight flick can be observed when hunting while they wait to pounce when tail is twitching means that they are agitated or nervous this can be seen when we pet them and when the tail starts twitching it's time to start thinking about letting them go if we don't stop we will soon meet the lashing or wagging tail it's more aggressive than the twitching and it happens with a longer portion of the tail this means high arousal and it can end up in aggression if we are in front of an aggressive cat if your cat bites you and scratches you out of nowhere and you want to know more about play aggression i created a video a couple weeks ago that you're going to find interesting you can click here or you can also go to the description box down below i'm also going to be adding the link there good girl give me give me 10 minutes let me finish the video and i'm coming with you we can play we can do something the body carriage contains also a lot of information being divided mostly in three parts water-like and they just

(Start: 00:04:03)
merge with the environment stretched out and displaying a loose posture our cats are comfortable and relaxed don't misread this one if our cat it's completely relax water-like and show a belly this is not an invitation to pet them there this means they trust us they are comfortable if we use these positions as an invitation to pet them we are failing their trust the best thing we can do in those cases is just let them be the second best is give them a head drop or a chin rub but leaving the vulnerable and exposed parts untouched when they become smaller hunched or crotch cats are cats that are usually fearful or uncertain they usually curl the tail around them as well when they become big when their forests puffed and they put their bodies sideways probably arts they are trying to tell the recipient of the body language that they are bigger than they seem adopting a bigger posture is usually a sign of a cat that's getting ready to fight while a smaller cat is in

(Start: 00:05:03)
flight mode let's move to more subtle cat body language there are three main cues that cut eyes can give us a fix and relax the stair means that our cat is calm and it's a way to show us affection this fix and relaxed gaze sometimes comes with a slow plane and this is my favorite cat body language it's the cat way to say i love you i trust you when i notice that me it's giving me a relaxed case i sometimes initiate the i love you bling and if i'm lucky she does it back if you're not linking to your cat i highly encourage you that you start doing it you're going to see that they answer most of the times and it's a very beautiful way to say i love you i trust you to the point that you're going to realize that sometimes you are out there in the street and you find someone that it's friendly that just looks genuinely good and you're going to blink at them and then you're going to be completely mad it's cute try it pupils

(Start: 00:06:04)
dilated big and wide means that your cat is fearful or aroused this is the way animals have to get more light in and receive more information from the environment when it happens during playtime means that your cat is about to bounce or start crazy mode deleted pupils can also happen in low light environments but that doesn't imply that the catheters aroused or playful the ears can also tell us some information about our cat's feelings and interests when the ears are pointing forward means that our cat is alert attentive or even aggressive it usually comes with whiskers pointing forward as well all these trying to receive as much information as possible from the direction they are pointing at seeming rotated ears outwards means that our cat is fearful when on top of outwards the ears are flat against the head also known as airplane wings where you can barely see their ears means that our cat is extremely fearful and probably aggressive how to interpret cat body language then play with me slight tail twitch fix relax the stair and deal in upright

position with or without question mark go away tight body posture either becoming smaller or bigger in the ears until twitching or wagging and i'm relaxed casual gay slow bling and water-like body postures whenever we see contradicting body language the one that's saying go away always prevails there's a way to talk cat a common language that both you and your cat can understand when our message is clear and the outcome is positive our cats can understand what we are saying to them cats can be trained the same way we train dogs using positive reinforcement and clicker training if you have never heard about clicker training or you have but you have never tried it before i really encourage you to watch this video and learn clicker training in three easy steps it is really a game changer for cat parents if you already know what clicker training is this playlist has our best clicker training tutorials so that you can take your clicker training to the next level stay wild stay safe

(Start: 00:00:00)
good girl good girl you can teach anything to your cat using clicker training let's jump into it there are two types of offering conditioning at a high level reinforcement is a process by which we encourage a particular behavior so that it happens more often in the future positive reinforcement offers an appetite stimulus after a behavior that we want to see more often and negative reinforcement removes a nauseous stimulus after a behavior that we want to see more often so in both cases the subject exposed to these stimulus it's improving their general well-being after they do the behavior that we want to see more often on the flip side punishment is the process by which you discourage a behavior from happening again in the future when we train our cats we mostly use positive reinforcement which is built on the premise discovered by bf skinner that behaviors that are rewarded are likely to be repeated when we're using positive reinforcement in combination with a clicker to mark the behaviors that we want to reward we're

(Start: 00:01:01)
doing clicker training if you are already subscribed to this channel you most likely know what clicker training is but in case that you are not two things first subscribe second let me briefly explain you what clicker training is and how it works clicker training it's nothing more than priming your cat with the knowledge that after a click comes a reward when are we going to click after the cat does the behavior that we want to see repeated more often the three steps process that you need to follow to train your cat clicker training are one charge the clicker two click or mark the behaviors that you want to see repeated in the future and three fun ways to encourage your cat to do a certain behavior so that you can click and reward them for that this is a very very brief explanation of what clicker training is if it's the first time that you're hearing about clicker training i really encourage you to watch this video first to learn what clicker training is how to get things done right and after that you can come back to this video let's assume that if you're watching

(Start: 00:02:01)
this video at this point you know what clicker training is your clicker is charged and your cat is ready to learn a complex trick and what is a complex trick a complex trick is a trick that your cat cannot learn in one go and to solve that problem we gotta get creative there's a three steps process that i like to follow first how many and what steps are going to get our cat to perform the desire outcome and we're going to call that the path of least resistance the second step is to define games that are going to get our cat to perform on their own the behaviors that we have defined in the previous and third pivot and course correct if there's a step where our cat gets stuck or there's a game that it's not working we need to be able to identify that and find a different step or a different game to achieve that behavior the time and duration of a session has to be adapted to your cat's overall interest and mood cats have a shorter attention span than us and they like doing things the way that they want when they want it how they want to do the trick that we're trying to teach our cat it's very

(Start: 00:03:02)
complex we're definitely going to need more than one session some tricks can even take weeks to teach let me use shoulder training as an example for creating the path of least resistance the first thing that i want to achieve is at least getting our cat close to our shoulder let's put us a milestone maybe getting our cat to put two paws on our shoulder then probably a second step could be getting our cat to put four paws on our shoulder like standing there the third step could be get our cat to jump on our shoulders on their own and finally the entry it's getting our cat to jump on our shoulders from the floor while we are standing now we need to create games to encourage our cat to perform the behaviors that are going to get them the click one important note here only behaviors that our cat cathy's doing on their own are going to be behaviors that our cat is going to be able to repeat so do not touch your cat when you're playing these games you need to find a game that is going to encourage your cat to do the behavior on their own so step number one we need to get our cats to touch our shoulders with two paws how can we achieve that feel

(Start: 00:04:03)
free to pause the video and think of ways that you could create a game to encourage your cat to touch your shoulder with two paws for instance in the setting that i have here behind me a great way to achieve that is to place me on the shelf just do a couple steps back take a treat get it close to her and force her that in order to get the treat she has to put two paws on my shoulder let's try it out i got a little scratch but this counts she put two poles on my shoulder on her own and then i click and i reward because there's so much going on with the lights the mic the camera i made a mistake and it's that it took too long for me to click when mia performed the behavior that i wanted i should have clicked right at the time where mia put her second ball on my shoulder and it took a slight second for me to reward the behavior to mark the behavior and that can create confusion you can go

(Start: 00:05:05)
back and check it out if you don't know what i'm talking about okay so this was my game this is the way i found to get mia to put two paws on my shoulder is this the same idea that you had if it is not please leave it in the comment section below i would love to know what creative ways did you find to get your cat to put two balls on your shoulder okay let's go for the second step the second step that we defined was having our cat with four paws on our shoulder and again feel free to pause the video and think of creative ways that you could achieve that there are certainly many ways to achieve the same result but the game that i decided to use to get me to have four paws on my shoulder was doing the same exercise that i did before get two posts and then with the treats still in my hand get slightly farther from the shelf so that mia had to come on top of my shoulder to achieve that treat okay it was very bad but she did it

(Start: 00:06:06)
i guess it counts and on and on i don't want to teach you the full process of teaching your cat to jump on your shoulder because there's already a video for that so if you want to train your cat to jump on your shoulder you can click the link here otherwise let's continue with this video let's put another example how do we get our cats to jump through our arms forming a circle i would first separate this streak in easy steps and then i would try to define games to get mia do these on their own using operant conditioning let's first define the small steps on the problem step number one would be to get mia over my step number two would be to raise my arm just enough so that mia can not crawl underneath but has to do a higher step to go over my arm the third step would be to raise my arm even more and now the cat has two options they can choose to go underneath or over our arm the trick is going to try to convince them to go over our arm because they're going to be rewarded for it and finally the fourth step once our cat is already jumping we add the second one and this

(Start: 00:07:07)
is going to be the trigger for the behavior now that we have defined the steps we need to find games to convince our cat to do these behaviors on their own in this case the trick is fairly simple because we can use finger targeting to draw our cat from one side to the arm to the other one good girl good girl good girl good girl training your cat is going to help them be more social less anxious and overall more content i've created a playlist with the best clicker training tutorials that we have in our channel you can check that out here and the youtube algorithm thinks that you want to watch that one next so you can also check it out if you like this video if you like our content share it with a friend you're making us a favor by

Title: AGRESSIVE CAT? This can help! - Stop a Cat Biting and Scratching

(Start: 00:00:00)
you are a loving cat parent and you like playing with your cat but sometimes your stuff fighting scratches you out of nowhere today i want to share with you how to prevent plague aggression and if it's already happening how to stop it why do you want to focus on play aggression because play aggression is the most common form of cat aggression directed to the cat parents also because it comes with warnings that might be difficult to identify at first but once we do the behaviors can be easy to fix the other type of behaviors are worth talking about as well but that's a topic for another video in this channel we post weekly videos talking about clicker training positive reinforcement correcting behaviors adventure cat training in general cat advice if you like this kind of content and you want to transform the bone with your cat consider subscribing because we upload weekly content helping you elevate the bone with your cat less work hey you yes you the one that always complains that it takes me too long to get into the solution in my

(Start: 00:01:00)
videos i've added timestamps in the description box down below so you can skip this part if you want to but the reality is that we need to understand why our cat is biting us before we try to fix it there are three reasons that can trigger play aggression and can turn your hands into a target all of them have to do with your cat being in some sort of discomfort poor socialization boredom or over stimulation let's talk about poor socialization first because still today so many people overlook this one the degree to which individual cats inhibit their rough play varies from cat to cat but it's mostly learned through trial and error kitties learn how to control how hard can they bite from their moms and their litter mates a kitten which is removed before two to three months of age might have not learned how to play and it can lead into unwanted nipping and to temper their play behavior i would love to know what's the average age that kitties are brought home so would you mind writing in the comment section below how old was your kitty when you first brought it home the best way to prevent plague

(Start: 00:02:00)
aggression is to never adopt a kitty that's under 12 weeks of age the second best way when the cats are already exhibiting the behavior it's to let them know that it's not fun for us imagine a box with an electrified floor and also the ability to deliver treats that box has a prisoner a rat depending on the levers that the rat would pull the box would deliver a reward or a punishment this box is called the skinner box and it was invented at the beginning of the 1900s by df skinner to study animal behavior luckily we don't need a skinner box anymore to train our cats but the learnings that he got from his studies created the framework upon which operant conditioning is built there are two types of offering conditioning at a high level reinforcement is a process by which we encourage a particular behavior so that it happens more often in the future positive reinforcement offers an appetitive stimulus after a behavior that we want to see more often and negative reinforcement removes a nauseous stimulus after a behavior that

(Start: 00:03:02)
we want to see more often so in both cases the subject exposed to these stimulus is improving their general well-being after they do the behavior that we want to see more often on the flip side punishment is the process by which you discourage a behavior from happening again in the future and again we have positive punishment and negative punishment and bear with me because this can be a little tricky to understand positive punishment it's the addition of a nauseous stimuli after a behavior that we don't want to see in the future very easy to understand positive punishment it's what our cats are very good at if i do something that you don't like you swat at me negative punishment is removing something good or desirable after a behavior that we don't want to see repeated in the future for instance if you don't behave you're not gonna get dessert you've probably heard that cats don't do well with punishment and that it can really affect the bond with them but that's only partially true positive punishment which is having a nauseous stimuli after a behavior that we don't want to see repeated in the future can

(Start: 00:04:03)
really affect the bond with our cat and can even create fear from our cat towards us for instance spring or cats with water when they do something that we don't like but negative punishment which consists in removing something that our cat wants after they do a behavior that we don't want to see repeated in the future that can go a long way so when our cat bites us during play time we want to use negative punishment and we're going to mark the moment the same way we mark with the clicker when we're doing clicker training but in this case we're going to mark the pain we're going to mark the biting the moment that our cat does something that we don't want to see more often and we're going to mark it in the form of a complaint ow quick note and this is going to be funny so don't take it into account but when our cat complains they do do like they complain more subtle more like so try to take that into account when you complain make sure that they know that you are being hurt not that you are getting angry after after marking the pain you step away and

you don't play with them for two to five minutes by doing that you remove something that they want which is playing with you when that time is passed grab a toy and tell them how they are supposed to play which is biting the toy not your hand cats also learn acceptable play from humans if you allow your kittens to play with your feet and hands when they're small they might learn that feet and hands are objects to play with so when they are seeking playtime in the future they are going to go for your feet and hands and it can be painful when they're grown up and consistency is key your kitty won't learn that feet and hands are not objects to play with if someone in your household is allowing them to do so if someone in your household is playing with feet or hand with your cat the best solution is to kick that person out of your household that person has to stop and when it happens remove yourself from the play area as we mentioned before particularly younger cats and very active breeds have high

levels of energy keeping them amused and engaged can be a challenge cats that spend long hours alone without many opportunities to play might use play aggression to trigger us to play with them as they would use with their fellow feline friends play with your kitty two to three times a day using interactive toys these toys are toys that have a feather in one end and yourself in the other end if your cat doesn't want to play with you you're probably doing something wrong does your phone on the bed or on the floor if you're a very bad tosser and pay attention to your cap remember that playing with your cat it's not only the best way to keep them healthy and behaving it's also the best way you have to bond with them i will add the toys that i use in the description box down below keep in mind that when cats are playing they are hunting so move the toy as if it was spray try to cross it through their field of vision or move it away from the kitty to trigger that hunting instinct sometimes the most interesting part of the playtime is when the toy is not

(Start: 00:07:08)
moving and they get the chance to hide and stalk until they pounce and kill it while stationary toys are not a substitute for interactive play it is important that your cat has toys available when you are not able to play with them offering your cat opportunities to release that energy during the day instead of sleeping all day and waiting for you it's also a great way to prevent play aggression over stimulation happens when our cat has been excited to a point that the raw feline that they have inside them takes over when that happens the kind of aggression that our cat is going to be displaying it's looking more like redirected aggression more than play aggression they have all that energy that they need to release and you become the outlet for that energy and you can do two things you can either grab a toy and play with them until they are exhausted or you can finish the play session as it would finish in the wild stalk pounce kill fist and sleep feeding our cats after a play session is going to help them relax and

(Start: 00:00:00)
it doesn't matter how big or how small your house is or the size of your budget after today's video you're going to know how to enrich your cat life that's have the theme of being low maintenance animals but you know that's not true cats need high quality food exercise interactive place and a safe place to sleep in order to be happy me and i have moved back to new york and it made me realize how important it is to create an enriching safe and cozy environment for our cats if your cat doesn't see beyond the four walls that limit your home it is particularly important you provide an environment that allows them to thrive cats that are gaining weight feel depressed anxious or exhibit unacceptable behaviors are most likely cuts that could use a change in their environment or their lifestyle i've decided to create an entire video talking about how to enrich your cat life when your cat is mostly indoors less work what is scattification according to urban dictionary gratification is the art of making small changes and adjustments to your home so

(Start: 00:01:01)
that it meets both your needs and your cats i want to provide you with a blueprint for catifying your home so you can provide a safe cozy and enriching environment to your cat i'm going to divide today's video in three pieces places of comfort because cats spend more than 15 hours a day sleeping and resting playgrounds to satisfy your cat's primal instinct and challenge them the way outdoors do and finally safety considerations because it's not really cutified if it's not safe for them but i'm going to add value throughout the video you can find the timestamps in the description box down below as well as the links to the products i'm going to be talking about has it ever happened to you that you go to a friend's place or an airbnb and you don't sleep quite as well as you sleep in your bed in your house this is because our home has become our place of comfort our sanctuary we have pictures of our loved ones our own furniture we know where everything is the sense of comfort and belonging comes from the pheromones they spread around the house pheromones are chemical messages that our cats use to

(Start: 00:02:01)
interact with the world around them these messages are released through special glands that our cats have throughout their bodies can be found in your cat's chin lower ears forehead cheeks still rear back and fall pads pheromones have no other and cannot be detected by humans or dogs they are only perceived by other cats it's like their secret language you might have seen your cat bump or rock against objects or even yourself cats do this behavior called marketing to define the areas that they consider saying when looking for the places of comfort for your cat i would recommend you to look at least for these four attributes either in combination in one single element or in separate elements around the house provide soft surfaces scent catchers which are the surfaces that we mentioned before that allow your cat to spread their pheromone small spaces where they can squeeze themselves into we all know that saying if it fits it sits because cats are both predators and prey they feel safer when they know that nothing can come from behind because they are against something choose a place that allows

(Start: 00:03:02)
your cat to curl and snuggle inside dark hiding spots cats will choose a dark spot as a hiding place for their protection first because our cat's eyes have been designed to thrive in low light environment so they can see really really well in those places that we think that are way too dark and finally heat retention cats love to be warm and i bet that if there's a spot in your home where the sun shines through a window and warms up the floor your cat is going to sit there as long as the sun lasts it is ideal if you can provide your cat with a safe cozy place that is warm and are nearby where you usually spend your time so your cat doesn't have to compromise between being comfortable and being with you i have several spots spread through my house so that me i can feel comfortable while being with us but the one that she's using the most it's a felt game mia loves it and i don't think it's because it looks great i think it's because it takes the four points that i mentioned before a more budget-friendly

(Start: 00:04:03)
option is to have a cardboard box or a carrier with a towel inside so they can spread their pheromones as well as being cozy secluded and in a darker place if you fell in love with the cat cave i have good news for you it is handmade in nepal and made out of hundred percent merino wool i've partnered with them to offer me as friends a discount to access the unique discount use the link in the description box down below scratching is another way your cat has to mark the territory cats have scent glands in their paws when your cat is scratching in multiple places they are working on spreading pheromones rather than sharpening their claws just as they use facial or body rubbing your cat might use their gloves to mark their territory and if you don't want your cat to redesign your cell phone it is better to offer alternatives some of your cats favorite scratching places are going to be the limits what they consider the boundaries of their territory the trick is to offer scratching posts near those areas cats are complex critters and thriving environments that best replicate their wild behaviors without

(Start: 00:05:05)
enrichment cats can develop behavioral issues like aggression anxiety attention seeking urinating or defecating outside the litter box even eating disorders amongst others before domestication cats live hunted climb explored the outside where they had a rich diversity of experiences the cat's natural behavior repertoire includes climbing and jumping hunting and seeking high ground for safety and comfort while domestic cats have a safe environment living with their humans indoors they are happiest in environments that stimulate outdoor instincts have you ever played at florist lava squid games came to my mind what a crazy game to play in that movie okay let's get back at it despite some cats will be comfortable on the ground our cats wild relatives hunt and rest both on trees as well as on the ground this causes that most felines are going to appreciate having vertical space and this ranges from positions at mid height to positions above our shoulders the addition of shelling units and cat trees provide our cat vantage points as well as the opportunity for

(Start: 00:06:07)
active behavior keeping our guides entertained relaxed and fit a little trick if your cat doesn't like the cat tree that you bought these things are expensive we want our cats to use them you get some kibble and you place the keyboard strategically throughout the tree throughout the shelving units just to get your cat used to finding surprises when they are climbing you will see that in no time they're going to create the positive association and they're going to start using it more i chose catastrophic creations and tough tempo because i love the look but any shelving unit can serve the same purpose if you have good diy skills you can add a threaded area on top of the shelving units that you buy making them send catchers this way your cat is going to be able to spread their pheromones on those shelves making them just perfect and this video would not be complete without talking about safety considerations and cat proofing your home while your home might be now the most comfortable and enriching place your cat has ever seen it can still be dangerous there are four kinds of dangers i would like to warn you about

(Start: 00:07:08)
toxic plants and other natural dangers there are many plants that are very pretty and very dangerous for our cats because the list goes on and on i'm going to add a link in the description box down below so you can go and check if the plants that you currently have in your home are safe or not for your cat the best thing you can do if you have plants that are toxic for your cat is remove them and add some plants that are not but in the case that you fell in love with a plant that you've been growing for five years the best thing you can do is watch this video where i talk about some methods to prevent your cat to munching on your plant the second point secure electric cords not many cats will play and chew on electric cords but if your cat is one of them unplug any cords that are not in use and invest some money on quartz protectors these two might prevent your cat from a potential major shock on their system check your windows and screens cats are escaped artists and leaving a balcony or a window open and unsupervised can be extremely dangerous as your cat might try to escape or trip and fall and

(Start: 00:08:09)
finally with the vertical space comes the risk of falling make sure your cat has a clean fall if they were to trip and fall from any of the vertical spaces that you provided a rock or a carpet underneath will also help them have a soft landing if you have webs until here and you're not yet subscribed make sure you smash that subscribe button down there and click the bell button to get notified when the next video it's up and while you wait for next week's video to come up make sure you watch this one here because i'm sure it's going to help you elevate the bond with your cat until then stay wild stay safe

[Music] let me share with you how we certainly navigated long island only with the use of sun and wind and our two cats [Music] as you can see there was a lot of working going on [Music] we sailed from santosan and before we realized the day was over and night sailing started and because all footage goes dark

(Start: 00:01:00)
i'm gonna save you from watching [Music] and the cats loved it they used the opportunity to get to know the boat better [Music] oh [Music] and after 36 hours sailing non-stop we made it to harihan the prettiest place where you can do nothing at all look at that

(Start: 00:02:03)
[Applause] and that night we were rewarded with the prettiest sunset i've seen in my life holy [ __ ] it's getting so red both me and coy turned into snuggly monsters and soon we realized why [Music] we were not ready for inclement weather and we had to go out there and make sure we were safe and the anchor would not move during the storm we used the opportunity to take a break and rest a little bit before the journey continues [Music] yes [Music]

(Start: 00:03:04)
[Music] on the fourth day we decided to take me and coy to the beach and we went for a little walk you're doing great [Music] before we realized it was time to head back because there was a storm coming and we had to change the sails mia come here good girl [Music] [Music] [Music] the cats found their favorite spot to stay where it was rocky and we were taking turns at captaining

(Start: 00:04:06)
because it was only day five but we were already very very tired before we realized another pretty sunset and one day more behind our backs and just when we were starting to think the storm would never come it came we were about an hour and a half under heavy wind and waves with the only consequences of a little kiosk on their deck [Music]

(Start: 00:00:00)
eats spilling time and if you are a cat parent you know that choosing the right food for our cats can be overwhelming most of us cat parents treat our cats as a member of a family and because of that feeding is extremely important well today i'm gonna show you what i've been feeding mia for the last two months and the results have been amazing [Music] less work like eight months ago we started having stomach issues for no apparent reason i still was smelling very bad i'm not gonna enter into much detail but something was clearly off that made me start investigating about food allergies food intolerance and non-conventional methods to beat your cat today i want to share with you what i've learned and what i'm feeling mia after all my research i'm going to divide this video in four parts the aafco statement complete and balance food processed foods either wet or given the trend right now roughly and i would really recommend you to watch until the very end of the video because at the end of the video i'm going to share with you what i've been feeling mia and the

(Start: 00:01:00)
results have been amazing let's rewind let's start from the beginning what does complete and balanced food even mean simply it means it meets the latest scientific standards it is important because a too low or a too high level of micronutrients or even more important macronutrients protein and carbs can have a massive impact on the health of our pets the standards include minimum level of protein minimum and maximum level of total fat minimums and sometimes maximums of other essentials amino acids fatty acids vitamins minerals and other nutrients such as pollen and for cats towering note that there are no standards for carbohydrates because they are not even necessary for our cats while american and european standards are very similar when it comes to minimum requirement daily fair in maximums and legal limits with the european standards providing limits to more nutrients than the american standards in the us the standard is aafco and in europe f-e-d-i-a-f every food we feed our cats should be following nutrient standards

(Start: 00:02:01)
the way we have to know if it does is because the label will say something like formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the organization of your country i see i see a hand in the bag yes yes you can go check your cat's food you can pause the video and come back whenever you're done no really if you want to pause the video and go check your cats you can do it now i promise i'll be here when you come back as i have no formal training in cat nutrition i have to go to the experts and i want to share with you two things before we go deep into the topic googling stuff it's not doing research it's called confirmation bias google's algorithm by default serves you the content that you want to read so if you search is raw food good for cats you will certainly find articles matching the opinion that you already have same goes with is raw food bad for cat to really get an unbiased opinion we need to go to research with medical evidence which takes me to the second point to create medical evidence there must first be an understanding of the types of research

(Start: 00:03:02)
that exists case control studies identifies patients that have an outcome of interest and patients without the same outcome a case series is an examination of series of patients with the desire there is no control group in this case a randomized controlled clinical trial involves participants that are randomly allocated in an experimental group or a controller followed by assessing the outcome of interest and finally a systematic review or method analysis that creates a summary of the medical history these studies are treated as evidence levels from 1 being very high when several studies lead to the same conclusions to 5 which include an expert's opinion without explicit clinical appraisal there are no high evidence published studies meaning 1 2 or 3 talking about the benefits or the risks of feeding your cat romy which means that there's very little we know about this kind of diet i will link in the description box down below all the articles and studies that i read to form my opinion and if you are an avid reader i would recommend you do that as well kibble is it bad well

(Start: 00:04:03)
are cookies bad then the average cat needs around 250 calories per day then as cat people our job is to find the most nutritional way to feed 250 calories per day to our cats when it comes to how much to feed our cats you should make your decision based on your cat individually along with your lifestyle and budget you want to make a wise decision because your cat's long-term health depends on it and you want to avoid the necessary risk or lead your cat to being over today i want to share with you some of the learnings i got from the information i was able to gather premium kibbles are loaded with carbohydrates commonly soy with rice corn berlin potatoes tapioca starch to serve us sources of energy and calories an estimated 60 percent of us cat are considered overweight reason being poor nutrition especially when free fat heart-based diets can disrupt the signaling of hormones like insulin and leptin which help control appetite and avoid overeating also these carbohydrates have a very high glycemic

(Start: 00:05:04)
index which basically ranks how quickly and how high the sugar level of blood spikes after eating a certain food you're disrupting our youtube video put the wrong kind of fuel in a high performance engine long enough and you're gonna ruin that engine oftentimes premium people are very low on animal protein levels let's just remember that cats are obligate carnivores veterinarian claudia acre states that natural prey of cats contain at least 55 percent of protein 45 of fat and very little carbohydrates around one or two percent on a dry matter base dry food ranges between twenty to fifty percent carbohydrate if the cat only needs one to two percent why does skill make that nutrient almost half of their diet according to dr lisa pearson guts have no dietary needs for carbohydrates and more worrisome is the fact that the high carbohydrate diet can become a health issue for our cats premium cubes are processed with high heat and pressure that destroys many micronutrients that the ingredients once

(Start: 00:06:07)
contained and the same thing happens with wet food they use mostly synthetic minerals and vitamins to replace the micronutrients that are lost in the preserving process and because wet food and dried lose most of their flavor during the cooking process and they also contain flavor enhancers sweeteners and other chemicals and preservatives dry people is popular among many cat owners because it's convenient it comes in large bags and because their moisture content is only 20 it lasts longer even after opening another benefit of dry cable is that because the moisture level is so low there's less risk of bacterial growth and you can just leave it out if you're at work or outside for a few hours and finally yes it's cheap what's raw food a raw food diet usually includes muscle meat organ and ground bones the most common meats included in raw food are chicken turkey fish and eggs but other meats can also be included ramut has in general not gone through a processing facility and thus it's closer to what your cat would find in nature with its pros and its guns and raw food is very trendy

(Start: 00:07:09)
right now and there are many cat people that are starting to feed that to their cats but is it good for them a recent study analyzed 240 samples of 20 commercialized raw food brands and found that 6 of those samples came positive for salmonella which none of the commercial brands do if your cat is young or very old or has a chronic disease or an immune deficiency raw foods can be dangerous for them because now on top of dealing with their illness or their geriatric or pediatric state they must fight those organisms present in the raw food many veterinarians won't recommend raw food either for the risk of lacking nutrients that our cat needs or the health risks inherent on feeding a raw food diet one thing is clear if you go for raw food i would recommend you go for a commercialized brand that's formulated by veterinarians and follows the standards of your country since your cats are obligated carnivores their digestive systems are designed to especially thrive with meat-based diets digestive crack is short and moves

(Start: 00:08:10)
flashing bones quickly which protects them from bacteria that the raw meat might contain also as they got this very acidity with a ph of 1.5 to 2 it kills bacteria because their digestive tract is designed for raw food their stool is going to be smaller and less smelly which doesn't happen with kibble or wet food because they contain lots of carbohydrates that our cats are not good at processing and therefore all that goes to waste finally cats have their origins in areas with very little water and their thirst drive is very low as they've evolved to receive their water intake from the food they eat and it becomes a lot easier with raw diet or canned food i am very happy that you made it to here today's video is packed with a lot of information if you are liking it it took a while to put all this together so give this video a thumbs up to tell the youtube algorithm that this video is worth watching the tough reality is that because raw meat is very new and the companies that sell roaming are very small there's very little research supporting that feeding your cat raw meat is beneficial for them

(Start: 00:09:12)
as i mentioned earlier mia was having digestive issues and i tried everything commercially available including very expensive prescription only veterinarian food and none of that seemed to work so after all this test and learned i decided to give a shot to rob i've been adding a little roll in her wet food in every single meal around 25 and me is doing great her school is more consistent it smells nice she is extremely active and looking very healthy so i'm most likely going to keep doing that and even increasing the amount of drop i put in every meal yeah there's this brand darwin's that chips raw food to your door and it's cheaper than the wet food that i was feeding mia they have now 50 discount for first-time buyers and they are following all the regulations from the aafco that i was mentioning earlier i've added the promotional link in the description box down below so you can join us if you want to transition to raw food manipulating raw meat comes with risks

(Start: 00:10:14)
and according to the studies that i went through transitioning your cat to a raw meat diet can become riskier for a household so if you decide to join us on the raw journey make sure you put systems in place to prevent cross-contamination like washing your hands and washing the utensils that you're using like it's not nothing crazy i'm going to keep updating you on how the process go but so far i'm super happy with it if you want to take the bone with your cat to the next level make sure you watch this video next and that's it for today see you outdoors

(Start: 00:00:00)
training your kitty might be even more challenging than training a junior or even training an older cat but one thing is common in all of that when you start we never know how to do it younger cats have a lot of energy and they get distracted very easily due to their natural curiosity in this channel we've already covered how to clicker train your cat as well as how to teach many commands that are going to improve the bond with your cat but there's a question that i get asked constantly where do i start when do i start today it's going to be all about getting started at training your cat particularly during the early stages of their life between kitties and one year of it but if your cat is older you can still watch this video and use it as a guideline on what to teach first and how to do it today's video is going to be developed in three parts introduction to clicker training when to start and what to teach what we are not going to cover today is how to teach the tricks that we are going to be talking about but if you want to learn how to teach them you can just go to our channel and every single trick is explained there i'm also going to be adding the links to the tutorials

(Start: 00:01:00)
of all the tricks that we're going to be covering today so after this video you can go and pick the one that you want to teach first if there's any part of this video that you want to skip i'm going to be adding time stamps so you can jump directly to the part of the video that interests you the most but i'm going to be packing this video with information that's going to be useful from beginners to expert cat owners so i'd recommend you to stick from the beginning to the end of the video let's get into it less work it's often thought that cats cannot be trained like dogs do but that's simply not true what's that one thing that gets your cat's attention most likely food is the first thing that came to your head operant conditioning relies on a very simple premise actions that are followed by reinforcement are likely to be repeated i need to show you this she's so freaking cute she's like you're filming i want to be part of this video back at it as i was saying operant

(Start: 00:02:01)
conditioning relies on a very simple premise actions that are rewarded are very likely to be repeated in the future through operant conditioning an association is made between a behavior and a consequence for that behavior and thanks to this association operant conditioning can be used to motivate behavior change and the best way to create an association between a behavior and the consequence of that behavior is an event marker an event marker it's an unmistakable sound that our cat is going to associate with a reward the idea is to create an association between the event marker and a tiny edible trick there are several markers you can use a work snapping fingers or a clicker i personally like the clicker because it's a very unique sound that's not going to occur outside training moments it's also a very fast sound so it's very easy to mark the exact moment where the behavior that you want to see repeated more often happen for instance if you're teaching the seat command you want to mark the exact moment where the butt touches the floor if you use a very long word like good girl or

(Start: 00:03:02)
congratulations or whatever it might take longer so your cat doesn't really know what exactly is from the gesture of sitting down that you're rewarding with the clicker you can mark exactly the moment the butt touches the floor that's why i like the clicker in the case that you go for a work make sure you choose a very short one good yes are words that work very well for trade the problem is that they might happen in other occasions and your cat is going to be crazy looking for that tree before starting the training there's one thing you need to do first charging the clicker you charge the clicker you have to click and immediately after offer a reward you will want to do that for at least 10 minutes several times a day so that the cat links the sound of the clicker with the reward you should wait at least a couple hours between sessions and keep sessions no longer than 10. very soon you're going to see how your cat anticipates the reward after hearing the click [Music] when that happens means that the clicker is charged it's that easy now you can get your training started we have a two minute video talking exclusively about

(Start: 00:04:05)
clicker training so if you're not totally clear on what to do or where to start you can watch as well that video i'm going to be adding the link here as well as in the description box down below because today we're not teaching any specific trick i would recommend you to finish this video and you can watch the other one afterwards starting clicker training too early can create insecurity or stress in very young cat the first trainer of every cat has to be their mom so at least until they are 12 weeks they should be with their mom where they learn how to play without hurting how to socialize and they learn how to use the litter box after 12 weeks around the three months of age the kitty can start formal training indoors for outdoor training i would wait a little longer at least until all vaccinations are done and they can wear tea and flea prevention in the case of mia we started clicker training indoors at 12 weeks of age and we started going outdoors around the 14 weeks a few months ago i created a free book for my patrons to elevate the bond with their cat using plain outdoors and food i would like now to offer this free ebook to my youtube subscribers i'm going to be adding the

(Start: 00:05:05)
link to the free book in the description box down below so you can download it as well a more complex question is what should i teach first see good girl good girl good girl if you end up with a cat that's younger than 12 weeks i would recommend you to start socializing the cat first with other cats and with people as well as making sure that they learn how to use a little box once the kitty is 12 weeks or older we can start formal training we're going to teach one trick at a time and not move to the next one until they master the one that we're doing before the problem of not doing so it's that they might learn a command and they might end up executing the command that you want but then when you try to put them together and do more than one trick at the time they're going to mix them up and they're going to sit instead of spinning or they're going to stand up instead of laying down and you don't want that to happen i like separating training in three big groups

(Start: 00:06:05)
fundamentals useful and party tricks fundamentals are tricks that when mastered are going to help you teach other tricks useful tricks are tricks that are going to improve the relationship between cat and person making your life easier and party tricks are the tricks that everyone wants to teach but they're not necessarily the most useful or the ones that are going to build knowledge to keep on improving so i would teach those the last again all these tricks and trainings that i'm going to be talking about are going to have links in the description box down below so you can watch them later the first tricks that you want to teach your cat are the fundamentals and the two main fundamental tricks are finger targeting and common code let me show you what finger targeting is mia [Music] now let me show you common command mia come here both tricks are extremely useful because they're going to help you lure your cat

you've recently committed to take a cat home and you want to make it right regardless of the age of the cat that you're trying to take home we all know that moving in can be overwhelming we are most certainly not the only ones that can get stressed when moving into a new apartment i'm moving in myself and when i was trying to make my home comfortable for me i thought wait a second why don't you make a video and you try to share your experience with other people that are going through the same or that are bringing a new kitty home hey hey do you approve [Music] let's try to make moving in a better experience for everyone and there is not a one-size-fits-all strategy when taking a nuke at home every cat is different as well as the circumstances but there are a few things that we can do to have an overall successful introduction in this video i want to share with you what are these key things to make a proper introduction of a new kitty or a new cat to our home to do so i'm going to separate this video into pieces in the first part of the video i want to talk about what to do when you go to the shelter or the breeder to pick up your

(Start: 00:01:01)
cat and in the second one we're going to see what are the key things that you need to do the first day when the cat is arriving home i'm going to add time stamps in the description box down below so if you already have a cat if you're not going to the shelter of the breeder you can skip this first half and you can go to the second half what to do the first day when you are arriving home at the end of the video i also want to share with you which are some of the most common mistakes when taking a new family member home i'm going to keep this video short and sweet so you can get value from start to finish let's do this let's work let's start from the beginning you arrive at the shelter and you have already fallen in love with your kitty or your cat well most likely the kitty of the cat has already fallen in love with you all the paperwork is done and you and your cat are ready to go home there are three things you need to ask the shelter or the breather before that happens put litter and something that has your cat smell understanding what food your cat has been eating is key as some cats can be very picky with the

(Start: 00:02:02)
food they eat for a reason [Music] they might be coming or even stop eating which is the food abruptly this is because cats have sensitive stomachs gut bacteria are crucial for digesting and obtaining the nutrients from the food that your cat is eating but not all bacteria can they just stall food when a new food is introduced it alters the intestinal environment this means that if you make a very abrupt change of food there's not going to be enough bacteria to digest the new food and the old bacteria that was used to digesting the old food is going to die because they have nothing to eat this is a complex topic that i am no expert about but long story short changing food probably can create intestinal imbalances causing symptoms such as vomiting diarrhea amongst others a good idea it's to ask the shelter or the breather what food has our cat been eating so that we can make sure that we have some of that at home for when we first arrive there are at least two other things you should ask your breather or the shelter when you go pick up your new family member but before we get to that i would love to

(Start: 00:03:02)
know how many of you are buying a cat versus how many of you are adopting a cat can you please write it down in the comment section below i would love to know the proportion of my audience that needs buying cat versus how many people are adopting a cat back at it two things that you really need to ask for when you go pick up your cat some cats might have problems identifying where to go when nature calls them having the same litter already at home it's going to make your life and their life a lot easier because they're going to recognize the smell and immediately know that that's their litter box another thing and i believe that this one is the most important one it's something that has your cats to smell at the breeder of the shelter the cats usually play with toys and have their own blanket or a small towel it would be very nice if you can get that same towel or some of the toys that they were playing with and you can take them with you to your home cats found their own scent reassuring so having a piece of garment or a toy impregnated with your cat's permanent can come extremely handy both inside the carrier as well as to create a more familiar environment

(Start: 00:04:04)
when you first arrive home during the trip home you're going to see that your cat might be meowing and stressed out some cats will appreciate dutch but if you see that it's not soothing them it's better to leave them alone what do you have there at home you should have a room ready to welcome your newcomer a safe place if you can choose it is better to pick a space that is medium too small bigger spaces can be overwhelming and we want our cat to explore the house little by little as they spread their smell and link to the smell as well if the room that you're choosing doesn't have any soft surfaces like carpets sofas curtains towels it's better to provide some for them so that they can use these pheromones that we were talking before to spread their smell and create that safe space that's reassuring for them the room should have at least a litter box a water bowl some food their carrier and a piece of garment if possible

(Start: 00:05:06)
already impregnated with their pheromones we have a room and the room has everything our cat needs it's time to open the carrier we're going to let the cat exit the carrier on their own some cats might jump off the carrier right away and some are going to take their time and get a hold of the situation from the safety of the carrier once the carrier is open and the newcomer is exploring the place we can stay around and see how the interaction is going but trying not to interfere let them peacefully explore the room and if they are in the mood for playing you can gently play with them but if the cat is too agitated i would recommend you to close the door and let the cat be on their own for a little while you can check in on them every 15 to 30 minutes and see if stress is transitioning towards curiosity when curiosity peaks you can open the door and let your cat explore the rest of the house if your home is very vehicle it has different floors try to keep spaces separated and let them explore only one floor at a time to prevent them from getting lost or feeling overwhelmed some cats are

(Start: 00:06:07)
more prone to hiding than others if that's the case of your newcomer you will see that they might spend a lot of time under the sofa inside the carrier that you provided or any other hidden spot that they find reassuring inside the house it's okay and it's completely normal in those cases when you open your house for your cat to explore try to provide spots where your cat can hide but still be around you and hear your voice and get used to your smell i have provided myself a safe space for mia so she can hang out around me when i'm working but still having a high spot which is what she likes the most there are a few mistakes you want to avoid when introducing your cat home and the first one don't force your cat to be with you quite the opposite the last thing that you want is to create a negative association between you and your cat because when they are stressed you're forcing them to be with you so it is very important that you give your cat some space both when going home on the car as well as when arriving home particularly if they are asking for time

(Start: 00:07:09)
alone another typical mistake is to not be ready what i mean by that you don't want to arrive home to realize that you still haven't bought the leader that you don't have food for your cat or that you don't have any scratch or any soft surface to provide your cat so that they can suit themselves and please don't do this don't go to the pet store after going to pick up your cat your cat is already very stressed we don't need to add extra pressure on them so anticipate go to the store and get everything that you need beforehand review if any of the plants that you have at home might be toxic for cats some plants might even be lethal and we want to remove them to avoid any possible risks there's a very cool website that allows you to check if the plants that you have at home are toxic or lethal for your cat i don't remember the name so i'm going to add it in the description box down below i'm working on a video with tips and tricks to take your home to the next level and make it perfect for your new companion if you are interested in watching that video as well make sure to subscribe and click the bell button so you are

Title: Teach Cat to SIT and STAY with Clicker Training
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq0CDiAPFsI

(Start: 00:00:00)
teaching your cat to sit and stay until you give them a comment can come extremely handy i use it to take pictures of me and to keep her winning when i'm serving her food so that she doesn't get cut with a can when i'm operating it or even to prevent her from door dashing if i have to open the door and she's around i will ask her to sit and stay so that when i open the door she doesn't run through that door have you ever realized that your cat asks you for things always the same way they have learned that certain behaviors give them what they want and behaviors that are rewarded are likely to be repeated less work it's often thought that cats cannot be trained to respond on commands like dogs but that's not true but it's that one thing that gets your cat attention every single time most likely food is the first thing that came to your head operant conditioning relies on a fairly simple premise actions that are followed by reinforcement are strengthened and more likely to occur

(Start: 00:01:00)
again in the future through operant conditioning an association is made between a behavior and a consequence for that behavior thanks to this association operant condition can be used to motivate behavior change this is exactly why it is so important to stop giving our cats and our children what they want so that they shut up or they stop annoying if there's a behavior that you're trying to stop and you're rewarded it's very likely to happen again in the future but let's get back to the subject of matter to teach sit and stay we're going to need a clicker or a marker and a bunch of treats let me talk very briefly about the tricks first because we're going to use foot as a motivator we want it to work as hard as we can for us and there are two ways to make those treats work hard for us first you want to put your cat eating on a schedule having free access to food all the time will diminish the value of the treats we're trying to offer them another way to make those streets work harder for us is to find that one trick that our guts go crazy for low calorie tricks are the best treats if we want to

(Start: 00:02:01)
keep our cats healthy regular kibble tuna or turkey are very low calorie treats that will work great when training your cat it is so freaking hot i'm so sorry i'm okay we're done with the treats now let's talk very briefly about the clicker and clicker training if this is your first time doing clicker training you will need to charge the clicker first you will see that this is not a battery operated device so how do you charge the clicker charging the clicker is prompting your cap with the knowledge that after a click comes a reward to do it you're going to click and reward for as long as it takes for your cat to understand that after the trip comes the reward [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:03:01)
another question that i receive very often is is a clicker really necessary well it's not necessary but it makes the work way easier if you don't have a clicker yet you can either get one from three dollars on amazon i will add the link in the description box down below or you can snap your fingers or make a click sound with your mouth for the sound to work as a marker we need to be able to repeat the same sound consistently through our cat's training if all this sounds too complicated don't worry i gotcha you can watch this video i filmed a full tutorial about clicker training how to get started in three very easy steps you can click on the link watch the video and come back when you're ready once we found that tree that our cat gets crazy for and our clicker is charged we can get to work we're going to divide sit and stay in two phases sit and stay yes we're going to first teach them how to sit and then we're going to teach them to stay until we release them from the position it is a simple yet super useful trick you want to teach your cat i use

(Start: 00:04:01)
it all the time when i'm outdoors and i don't want her going up and down or to put the harness on and off [Music] we're going to have the trip on our right hand and the clicker on the left hand if you're a lefty you can do it the other way around we're going to hold the treat between our thumb and our middle finger with our index finger pointing up we're going to hover the tree over our cat's head at some point our cat is going to sit to try to reach the tree with their mouth as soon as their butt touches the floor click then reward you have to repeat this process 5 to 10 times [Music] see once our cat understands the behavior we can remove the tree from our right hand

(Start: 00:05:02)
but we're going to keep doing the same gesture if our cat doesn't react without the tree this means that they still haven't understood the movement do it five to ten times more and try again without the tree once our cat reacts quickly to the gesture without the tree it's time to add the verbal command set good girl after several days using both the physical command as well as the verbal command our cat is going to understand the verbal command on exo and we can try to get them do it without the physical command we are halfway there now it's time to teach our cat to stay in the position until we restate no stay good girl stay is a game changer for every cat owner to prevent them from begging when you're serving them food but especially for photography

(Start: 00:06:10)
i'm going to be uploading a video very soon about how to take better pictures of your cat and some tips and tricks that have helped us reach over 100 000 followers on instagram if you want to learn more about cat photography make sure to subscribe and click the bell button so that you're notified when the video is up [Music] your cat needs to know the command we're going to do the stay comment then reward them for apparently no reason because the objective of this street actually is rewarding them for doing nothing sit stay good girl we're going to do the stay command again and we're going to walk a step back stay [Music] good girl if while walking that step back our cat doesn't move we click then reward in the case that our cat moves we're going to place them

(Start: 00:07:10)
back in the spot and do it again [Music] good girl the objective is to keep doing stay and walking farther and farther every time increasing our standards until we decide to reward them [Music] good girl if you want to take your cat training to the next level you might consider teaching them how to jump on your shoulder and if you're just starting consider watching this video and teaching your cat how to common command see you next time

Title: Teach NO to Your Cat - How and Why
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kStdUi2ebo

(Start: 00:00:00)
you can teach no to your cat and still consider it positive reinforcement there is no punishment in the word no we are still going to reward our cat for stopping the behavior that they are doing instead of punishing them for doing so i use the word no with my cadmia and i consider it extremely useful but there are many other trainers out there that believe that using the word no can affect your bond with your cat and can build frustration on them these trainers recommend focusing on the behaviors that you want to see repeated more often and there is some validity in their reasoning if you overuse the word no or you do it from a frustrated mindset you are most likely going to instill that frustration on your cat as well especially with cats that have created the negative association with the word now using it might make our cats get stressed or even shut down if that's the case with your cat maybe in your case it would be best to focus on those behaviors that you want to see more often for example if your cat is on the counter or about to jump on the counter you can do two things you can either say no or you can say floor in both cases

(Start: 00:01:00)
you're trying to prevent your cat from jumping on the counter in one case you're going to reward them from staying on the floor in the other you're going to reward them from not jumping both commands have the same purpose but the approach is very different and you might be asking in what cases should i use the word know that well i believe that using the word node to discourage your cats from doing a behavior that you don't want them to do or to tell them that what they are doing it's a behavior that it's not going to get rewarded it's faster and it's way more versatile than teaching them all the behaviors that we want them to do instead no should never mean to our cats bad cat no should only serve to communicate to our cat no that's not the behavior i'm looking for right now and if you do that you're not going to get rewarded teaching your cat to stop doing things it's one of the questions i get asked more often how do i stop my cat from waking me up and how do i stop my cat from eating my plan how do i stop my cat from jumping on my counter for that reason i am filming a series of tutorials teaching you how to stop your cat from doing the things that you don't want them to do

(Start: 00:02:00)
subscribe and click the bell button to get notified when the next video is up at the end of the day there is nothing wrong about teaching your cat the word no if they don't have any negative association with the word no person but there's nothing wrong either in choosing to avoid the word no altogether but today i'm going to help you teach the word no to your cat let's go into it let's work when i teach my cat miami trick i like teaching them using little games these games are a seamless way to little by little build up towards the command i want to teach at the end of the video i'm going to share with you a couple extra tricks so that these exercises are a success did you know today we're going to use three little games charging the word no with a lack of a reward it's like the opposite of charging the clicker teaching that no means no and practicing no in context i want to make a big big shout out to my first five patrons kelly rita claudia ed and monica thank you so much for

(Start: 00:03:02)
supporting what we do patreon is a crowdfunding platform that allows you to support little creators for as little as three dollars a month so that we can make content creation sustainable i have created a private facebook group for the outdoor bengal patreons where i'm going to be answering your questions about cat training and taking your cat outdoors i hope that it's also going to become a safe place where you can help each other and share progress with other cat lovers i'm going to add the patreon link in the description box down below so you can collaborate if you find value in what we're doing and you want to support us let's start with the exercise number one charging the word now for this exercise i'm going to place some people in my hand and i'm going to keep my hand open so that me i can see it at this point your cat is going to have two options one steal it two wait for you to give a go in the case that your cat dies to steal it we are going to close our hand while saying the word no we want them to develop the self-control when we say the word no no

(Start: 00:04:12)
no good girl we're going to repeat this over and over until they understand that they cannot do it without us giving permission no good girl i'll try one more no good girl as you can see every time she tries less hard to reach a treat because she knows that it's not the way she's gonna get it no good girl let's move to exercise number two now we're going to place the food on the table and do the exact same thing if they try to reach the food we're going to cover it with our hand no

(Start: 00:05:19)
good girl [Music] no good girl a good development of this exercise is to wait to say the good girl or click until they look at us in the eyes it's a good way to know that they are paying attention to us and not to the food the third exercise is the last evolution of this command it's going to help us translate between no you're not getting the food to know i don't want you to do this for this exercise we're going to place the food somewhere around the house where we don't want them to be we're going to use the leash we're going to put the harness on get the leash and walk them around the house as if we were walking them outdoors when they smell the food they're going to try to reach to that place what we're going to do we're going to use the leash to prevent them at the time that we say the work now

(Start: 00:06:19)
when they stop trying we're going to reward ultimately what we want to train them is to understand that if we say the word no they need to stop doing what they're doing and they need to pay attention to us because that it's going to get rewarded more than whatever they're doing no no come here come here good girl no come on the whole objective of the word no is to stop behaviors

(Start: 00:07:20)
before they even happen try to anticipate the behaviors that you don't want your cat to do and when they stop reward generously also try to start this training in a controlled environment you can either do it indoors or maybe in a very large piece of grass with any other competing stimuli if you practice this exercise for the first time on a hike or on a park with other animals it's very likely that your treats are not going to be strong enough to compete with all the other stimuli and you won't be able to lure your cat's attention to the training if you're a plant lover check out this video with five useful tricks to stop your cat from chomping on your plants no if you've enjoyed the video don't leave without giving us a thumbs up thanks for watching i'll see you outdoors

Title: Best Cat Harnesses Under $20 To Buy in 2023 (Ultimate Test)
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTUla7F2NpY

(Start: 00:00:00)
which harness should i buy well in this past year i bought every single harness with more than four stars and i tried them with mia when we were going on adventures today i'm going to review and share with you the ones that i like the most i'm going to break down my analysis in three big categories security easy to put on and off and comfort for the cad when we're going on adventures security is the number one reason why we buy a harness in the first place i consider security the ability of a harness to prevent our cat from sneaking out of it secure harnesses are great for places where we don't want our cat to escape like busy places or train stations airports the number two feature easy to put on and off it's very straightforward idea harnesses for cats that don't like being handled or that are just starting and are going to freak out when we try to put something on them and finally fit and comfort when we start taking our cats outdoors we're extremely worried about safety and easy to put on and off

(Start: 00:01:00)
why well at the beginning i did not want mia to escape and i was not very good at putting the harness on and off as mia has become used to it and i've become better at handling her i've realized that what makes the biggest difference it's her enjoyment when we're outside [Music] i define comfort by the ability of the harness to provide freedom for our cat to explore and enjoy the outdoors because these attributes are very different safety easy to put on and off and comfort every harness is going to be good at some but not on all of them at the end of the video i'm going to share with you the harness that i like the most and it has the best balance between all the three of them i'm albert mia's is sleeping so i'm not going to wake her up welcome to another episode of outdoor bengal trying to inspire and help you to do more with your cat let's work before we start your cat might be used to wearing a collar but we

(Start: 00:02:01)
do not recommend using a lesion of color you attach the leash to the collar and they do a sudden move or they get spooked because you're out and about the leash will tuck on their collar this can cause some serious injuries and even death is strangulation a harness distributes the pressure and doesn't talk with your cat's neck the number one reason for taking our cat out on a harness is safety we don't want our cat running out of reach or getting into trouble if you're looking for an escape proof harness either because you don't have the handling skills or you don't want to leave any room to surprises you have some very good options out there my number one pick is the pop tech harness this harness will allow you to secure the neck with two attaching points one velcro and one buckle [Music]

(Start: 00:03:05)
if you're struggling english training your cat we put out the video two or three weeks ago talking about how to live stream your cat i'm going to add the link both in the description box down below and you can also click in the link up here or here i always mess that up and because it's made out of mesh you can tighten it a little bit more than other harnesses without the risk of suffocating your cat the only flaw of this design is that the belly area is only secured with a velcro and with a lot of movement it can get loose if you don't like the very velcro or you live in a very warm area there's another good option this is also a great harness very hard to escape from because it has buckles both on the neck and on the belly [Music] [Music] the only thing i don't like about this

(Start: 00:04:06)
design is that the nylon is very thin and it can easily put too much pressure in a very determined area of our cap both harnesses were bought on amazon you can find the links in the description box down below my recommendation if you want a safe harness both from escape roof and safety for your cat point of view i will go with the pop deck one you have been gifted with a cat that doesn't mind the harness you are one very lucky cat parent cats can really hate to wear them the idea if our cat hates wearing a harness it's to make the experience as seamless as possible that's where harnesses that are easy to put on and off come extremely handy it's a great place to start there are basically three types of harnesses in terms of put them on and off step on where your cat is just going to put their paws inside of two holes and then you will pull the harness up more or less like our trousers our pants those harnesses seem great on paper but then the execution becomes extremely difficult because convincing our cat who

(Start: 00:05:07)
has both paws in two holes and not moving while we pull the pans up not gonna happen i do not recommend those if your cat doesn't like harnesses the second type it's put through the head they don't have any buckle you just stick them through their head the advantage is that once it's on it's very difficult to get it up the main problem though is that most cats hate getting that thing squeezed through their head so i don't recommend that either if your cat doesn't like harnesses the best harnesses are those that you can buckle my top two picks for this kind of harnesses are the pet safe one and the explorer that we just saw before i was mentioning this at the beginning of the video a good harness yes it has to be safe yes it has to be easy to use but in the end we're walking our cats for them so we want to make sure that the experience is as good as it can be harnesses that are comfortable are going to enable that cats are like acrobats

(Start: 00:06:09)
and we want to allow them as much freedom of movement as possible when wearing a harness good girl this has become my number one priority when choosing a harness for mia i've learned how to handle the leash so that she doesn't escape and it has become easier and easier to put the harness on and off after all the training my favorite harness so far it's the pet safe one extremely minimalist it's like a tongue for cats it has a system that goes loose when the cat is not applying pressure giving a lot of wiggling room and freedom of movement but it will apply pressure when the cap pulls [Music] [Music] so

(Start: 00:07:14)
[Music] the second option if you're looking for something that's comfortable but it will be skate proof it's the explorer and this is funny because the explorer is not the best option in all of the three categories but it's a very good option in terms of easy to put on and off safety and comfort [Music] if you have a very small kitty i would not use these kind of harnesses because the nylon is too thin their bones are weak their necks are thin i will go with something that is made out of mesh and has some sort of comfort on their neck my favorite option is the being pet one it has a head through system which might be hard not as hard for kitties but then it becomes extremely comfortable when they are wearing it [Music] [Music]

(Start: 00:08:21)
the only problem with this option it's that it's not super safe it's not escape proof but the mobility is great and the soft mesh on the chest area is going to be very gentle with your energetic kitty [Music] because all these options are below 20 i didn't think it made sense to add a comparison in terms of price and value for money i would really go for the one that makes the most sense for you so here's the verdict as i promised best hardness for starters pop text extremely easy to put on and extra safety because it has two buckles on the neck best harness for adventure kitties big bed head through first super comfortable mesh patch on the belly to keep your kitties safe while they explore the outdoors and finally the harness of harnesses the number one

(Start: 00:09:21)
the pet safe i really recommend this harness to any cat parent that wants to take their adventures to the next level be aware that taking our cattle doors might be overwhelming for them because they are predators but they are also prey make sure that you do it nice and slow because going with your cat too far too soon it's going to take you nowhere at all check out which are the most common mistakes when leash walking your cat and with this i'm done see you outdoors

Title: Try these to STOP a CAT from CHEWING PLANTS
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcDtxEASk1Y

(Start: 00:00:00)
today i'm coming with a hot topic how do i keep my cat off my houseplants most of cat lovers are not only cat lovers are also plant lovers i have no idea why this behavior happens but it happened if you think there's a reason why this is happening please leave it in the comments i'm super curious to know more about this cat plant lover behavior that's have the annoying habit of chewing house plants oh and they're not gonna go for the orchid that hasn't given you flowers in four years no if you've shelled out big bucks in a variegated monstera i bet they're gonna shred that down into pieces instead moreover there are some houseplants that can be toxic for our cats and we want to make sure that they're not chewing on them but probably the best thing you can do is avoiding toxic plants together i'm going to be uploading a video very soon talking about which plants are toxic for cats and which are not so if you want to know everything about it make sure to subscribe and click the bell button so you're notified when the video is out but today we're going to focus on how to prevent our cats from meeting your houseplants i'm going to share with you 5 ways to do that

(Start: 00:01:08)
let's work [Music] the first thing you have to do if your cat is eating your houseplants is understand what's causing the plant-damaging behavior because almost behind every cat misbehavior there's either hunger lack of attention or lack of exercise your cat might be very easily jumping on plants out of boredom make sure you provide your cat 2-3 good play sessions a day in the case that your cat doesn't interact with you when you're trying to play with them probably you're doing something wrong [Music] there's no such thing as a cat without a predatory instinct i'm also working on a video on how to play with your cat to drain their energy so if you haven't done it yet click the subscribe button so you don't have to wonder again why your cat is not playing with you if we can cross out hunger lack of attention or lack of exercise we might just be in front of a cat that's curious so once curiosity has been satisfied in a couple days the plants should be fine if your cat has taken it against one specific or one set of plants they might be lacking some nutrients and they are trying to satisfy that lack of nutrients through chomping your plan

it's always a good idea to talk to a veterinarian if your cat experiences some changes in their habits especially if they are eating plants regularly so back to the video i'm going to start with what i believe are the fastest and easiest solutions towards achieving our goal and i'm going to end the video with less obvious equally effective methods that might work if the other ones don't also if you stick around until the end of the video i want to make sure that i tell you also what you should not be doing if you're trying to avoid your cat from eating your plants because sometimes while trying to stop a behavior what we're doing is only reinforcing it as easy as it may sound the easiest way to prevent your cat from chomping on your plants is setting those plants off your cat's reach finding a place which is of limits is as easy as finding a top shelf or hanging them you can purchase hanging pots and hooks in any garden store hanging plants is both attractive and cat proof also if you happen to have spaces that remain close you can choose to put your houseplant collection there and i'm not gonna spend much more time on this one i think it's pretty straightforward one of the life-changing tricks you can teach your cat using clicker training

(Start: 00:03:11)
it's no or leave it without entering too much into the topic because this can be a whole new video i'll walk you through the steps to teach them this command we first need to demonstrate the behavior and the best way to achieve this is with a treat in our hand we are going to open the hand and show it to them when your cat tries to approach it we say no and we close the hand as soon as your cat loses interest and stops sniffing around you click then reward once your cat understands the command leave it or no you can start using it when your cat is doing things that you don't want them to do when they stop doing it you click then reward careful here there's a very fine line between teaching your cat to stop munching your plants and rewarding your cat from munching your plants make sure that whenever you decide to reward your cat for stopping they understand that their behavior that you want eats them not munching the plants otherwise whenever they want a treat they know that they go to the plant they munch it then they stop then they

(Start: 00:04:11)
get a treat i really recommend you to practice clicker training and positive reinforcement before doing this because in the case that you miss you might be reinforcing the behavior that you're trying to avoid in the first place spraying your plants with some products will also deter your cats from chewing and knowling on your plants and you can either create your own home remedy or buy it in the pet store or online they won't hurt your cat but they're gonna discourage them for poking around it a very cheap and effective homemade formula can be done with ingredients that you probably already have in your home water and vinegar catch the spicy smell and it doesn't hurt your plan get a bottle with a spray fill it hard with water and add half of vinegar another not as cheap home remedy it's using essential oils 1 3 essential oil 2 thirds of water i like using the olds option despite it's slightly more expensive but it smells great some good essential oils for doing this are lemongrass citronella peppermint and lavender you can pick the one you like and if it doesn't work you have three other options to try in the case that this is too much work too lazy i will add some

(Start: 00:05:13)
shoppable links in the description box down below using spicy cayenne pepper might be another option but it might hurt your cat if it gets into their paws and they touch their eyes i fret that there has been cases where the cat tries to scratch the cayenne pepper of their eyes causing self-harm i've tried to find more information about cayenne cakers used on cats and how they can cause self-harm but i haven't found anything so if you know of any case or you have any direction that you can give me please leave it in the comments i would love to know more negative reinforcement can be used with cats as well the idea is to make your cat associate approaching the plant with something bad like getting sprayed in the face with air or water there are some products that can help you achieve this sensor activated sprays which are going to be triggered when your cat approaches the plan much like a booty trap this won't hurt your cat but it's going to make them fearful making them have second thoughts every time they want to approach your green area i'm going to be adding the shopable link in the description box down below in the case that you want to try this method another way to achieve this is to spray your cat with water from the distance from the distance

(Start: 00:06:14)
you don't want your cat to associate the punishment with you you want your cat to think that the punishment came out of nowhere so if you use this method make sure you are discreet don't yell and shoot at the same time most of the mentioned tactics are not gonna work if you don't address the chomping cost if they are very selective about the plants they choose to chomp they might be looking for an extra source of nutrients or fiber also cats are known of chomping plants to produce vomit and remove the hair balls they have in their stomach providing your cat with plants that you're happy to share with them it's as important as stopping the behavior munching on these plants it's going to satisfy their need to chew and hopefully distracting them for your most priced plant make sure that the plants that you're providing are safe for cats like catnip or cat grass if what your cat is looking for its attention or killing boardroom i highly encourage you to spend more time with them two or three good play

(Start: 00:07:15)
sessions a day would suffice leaving some toys around especially if their interactive ones might also make the trick we cannot be available for them if you choose to do this make sure you shuffle them if the toys become too familiar they're going to get bored and they're just going to ignore them i want to stop for a second and share with you the things that you should not do also if you're finding value in this video it might be a good moment to hit the like button it helps me reach more people by telling them that this video might be worth watching if your cat is looking for attention play time or food and you stop what you're doing to provide it to them because they're munching on your plans you're just reinforcing the behavior you're telling them if you attack my plans i'm going to stop and do what you want me to do so they are actually training you stop doing that also if you don't want your cat to hate you don't punish the cat yourself because it might keep your cat off the plant but your cat is going to hate you in the process you don't want your cat to associate punishment with you this is the first video

hello this is albert here and i usually share adventures with me and tutorials on how to do it for those who haven't seen any of those videos don't worry i'm not going to drag it out to try to get you follow us on tiktok or instagram today i want to talk about something else the stuff that you don't see in those videos getting a cat comes with many perks but it also comes with great responsibility i would like to share with you what things changed in my life when i got mia in terms of routine our home my lifestyle changes as a person and finally economically if you're a newca mom or a new cadet or even if you had a cat for a while and you're looking for a fresh start consider subscribing the subscribe button it's like down there near the like and the share button you can hit it anytime if you find value in this video let's work there's a lot to cover today so without further ado let's see how mia changed my routine cats can be sleeping all day or going nuts on zumi's time what happens between zumi's time and sleep is food there are two ways to

tackle feeding you can either free feed them or put them on a schedule refilling your cat which means having always food available for them will allow you to have more time for yourself but it comes at a cost the opportunity to bond with your cat two three times a day and the opportunity of teaching your cat tricks cats conditions to the never ending dry buffet are also at risk of developing obesity urinary problems and kidney failure to name just a few but this is topic for another day so if you choose to put your cat on a schedule you're going to have to be there two three times a day or find someone or something that does it on your behalf automatic feeders are a good life hack to fit that mid-day meal if you're working away from home i will add some links to wet and dry food feeders in the description box down below so you can check them out if you're interested the second biggest impact in my routine is the waking up time i no longer need an alarm clock except for those very cheap flights at 4am in the morning especially if you put your cat on a schedule you're going to be waking up at the time of that first meal no matter what cats tend to find peace in routine and for

them every day is scatter day so forget about sleeping in on weekends or holidays finally playtime cats have the repetition of being low maintenance easy care pets but all cats especially kitties under one year of age have a ton of energy they benefit from consistent interactive play and activity aka exercise as much as dogs and people do playtime will keep your cat healthy and strong stress-free and it will greatly enhance the bones that you share with them keeping your cat healthy and happy with playtime will require from you 20 minutes at least in two good play sessions a day oh and i almost forgot most cats are happy to use the litter box because their instinct is to worry their urine and feces but what they don't do is clean the litter box and take up the trash scooping the push should be done daily cleaning and disinfecting the litter box at least every two weeks your lifestyle is going to be effective if you decide to share your life with a cat the two biggest impacts that i could find were traveling and housing traveling it's the movement of people and animals between two

distant geographical locations travel can be done by foot bicycle automobile train boat bus airplane ship or other traveling can be extremely fun and educational for humans but cats can get very stressed with it especially in trained ones regardless of if you want to travel with your cat for fun or it's a one-way trip because you're moving traveling with a cat comes with complications training your cat to be on their carrier ensuring that the transportation of your choosing allows pet carrying everything you need for them i take a carrier and a full bag of luggage just for me when we travel leader food toys a blanket toilet training pads some litter a disposable litter box water and food bowls and paperwork a lot traveling with a cat especially by plane can become very complex if you're curious about everything that goes into planning a trip with your cat i will be adding a link in the description box down below as well so you can check it out afterwards it's generally easier to find a property that will accept cash than a property that will accept dogs nevertheless you still have to check

clicker training with your cat in three easy steps once again i'm going to be adding the link in the description box down below so you can check it out if you want i think the introduction is done so let's get into it [Music]  is a simple yet super useful trick you want to teach your cat i use it with me all the time when i want to keep her still to put the harness on and off or when i don't want her roaming around when we're outdoors we're going to have the trip on our right hand and the clicker on the left hand if you're a lefty you can do it the other way around we're going to hold the treat between our thumb and our middle finger with our index finger pointing up we're going to hover the tree over our dad's head at some point our cat is going to see to try to reach the tree with their mouth as soon as their butt touches the floor click then reward you have to repeat this process 5 to 10 times [Music]

(Start: 00:03:10)
sit once our cat understands the behavior we can remove the treat from our right hand but we're going to keep doing the same gesture if our cat doesn't react without the treat this means that they still haven't understood the movement do it five to ten times more and try again without the tree once your cat reacts quickly to the gesture without the tree it's time to add the verbal command set good girl after several days using both the physical command as well as the verbal command our cat is going to understand the verbal command on its own and we can try to get them do it without the physical command down it's not a useful three percent but it's the very first step towards other tricks like roll over or play that before teaching the down command our cat has to master sit sit down

(Start: 00:04:14)
good girl from the sitting position you're going to get a treat and hide it under your fingers when your cat tries to reach it they're going to touch with their belly on the floor at that time you click then reward done [Music] [Music] at some point your cat is going to react almost instantly to the gesture when that happens means that your cat has mastered the trick then it's the right moment to remove the trip from underneath your fingers [Music] sit down [Music] again if our cat struggles without the

(Start: 00:05:14)
treat just add again the treat there's no problem with that [Music] the stay command is a game changer for every cat owner [Music] it will help you serve food without being disturbed stay no stay good girl or take amazing pictures of your cat while it's on a rock and you need a couple seconds to frame that shot your cat needs to know the command we're going to do the stay comment and reward them for apparently no reason because the objective of this street actually is rewarding them for doing nothing sit stay good girl

(Start: 00:06:15)
we're going to do the stay command again and we're going to walk a step back stay good girl if while walking that step back our cat doesn't move we click then reward in the case that our cat moves we're going to place them back in the spot and do it again [Music] good girl the objective is to keep doing stay and walking farther and farther every time increasing our standards until we decide to reward them good girl [Music] see pretty is the very first cute trick i want you to teach your cat before

(Start: 00:07:16)
teaching this trick your cat needs to know how to sit first from the sitting position we're going to take one treat and place it between our anular finger and our middle finger with this setting we're going to hover it over their head out of the reach i highly recommend you trimming your cat's nails when teaching this tree two things can happen now that your cat tries to reach the tree with their paws no or that your cat stands up lifting both front legs trying to reach the treat with their head good girl as soon as the front legs lift the floor click then reward once your cat has interiorized the behavior and knows that this means up you can remove the treat from between your fingers and do the gesture on its own if your cat doesn't understand the gesture on its own place back again the tree there's no problem with that and keep practicing with the tree between your fingers [Music]

(Start: 00:08:16)
okay let's stitch thin now the most useless trick of them all to ditch the spin we're going to lure our cat using a tree spin [Music] good girl we're going to start with the treat on our right hand and doing the full circle with our right hand once our cat masters the full circle with our right hand we're going to place the tree on the other hand and we're going to do half circle without anything and we're going to lure them over at the end of the spin with the treat in the other hand good girl we might have to start luring them farther up at the beginning but you will see that very early on they're going to start following the right hand even if there's no tree once the behavior is established you can keep on doing the circle with your right hand and clicking as soon as your cat is

(Start: 00:09:18)
facing towards you little by little you're going to want to have this big circle becoming smaller and smaller until it can become just a gesture [Music] today's video has been a little different from other videos i've done before but trust me despite some of these tricks might seem useless it's really going to improve the communication between you and your cat as well as your bond if you found this video interesting informative enriching in any way please give it a thumbs up it really helps me reach more people by telling them that this video might be worth watching i'm super excited about the video that i'm working for next week so subscribe and click the bell button if you want youtube to notify you when the next video is up thank you for joining me and i'll see you soon

although cold is not the only concern for cats during the winter months but that's a topic for another day the fit it's equally important the harness has to be tight enough so it's secure and your cat won't be able to escape but not so tight that it's restricting their mobility making them uncomfortable or flop on the floor as soon as they're wearing it get the right size by measuring the neck and the chest you should be able to fit two or three fingers between the harness and your cat's body [Music] check in the description box below for links to the three harnesses that i use and i like the most [Music] it's normal to be excited to go outdoors in the end it's where all the effort of training our cats will pay off this excitement might push us to go towards before our cats or even ourselves are ready to do so i would consider our cats are not ready if they're not familiar with the harness if our cats are not comfortable wearing the harness it restricts their movement or they walk clumsy if they're trying to sneak out of it or they're complaining constantly i would

(Start: 00:04:01)
also consider they're not ready if they cannot follow our lead when leash walking indoors there's only one opportunity to create a good first impression and we want our cats to be rooting to go outdoors if we push them too far too soon we might jeopardize weeks of work or even make them fearful of the leash and the door there's a tutorial in my channel where i talk about this training what to do step by step you can click here on the link and check it out if you haven't seen it yet it might be a good place to start if you want to continue watching this video i will add the links in the description box down below so you can check it afterwards [Music] you don't want to put the harness on your cake when it's all excited and agitated instead you want them to sit and stay your cat is going to get to know what the leash means and if they don't want to go out they're just going to let you know my recommendation is that you respect your cat's decision and wait for another day cats can be tired have an upset tummy or just not be in the mood for it at the beginning a little enforcement is okay

(Start: 00:05:01)
and it's good to challenge them but as soon as they know what the leash means if they don't want to go they're going to let you know and you should respect it if your cat is willing to go out just don't chase them around the house with a harness on your head and running like a maniac drain some of your cats energy and then ask them to sit and stay [Music] having control over your cat indoors is the very first step towards safe walks outdoors [Music] does your cat see an open door as an invitation to take off and have the adventure of a lifetime having a door darting cat can be a scary and stressful thing especially if they ignore you when you're calling them back it's terrifying to imagine what would happen to them if they get into a busy road or they get lost in the outdoors your cat might door dash for a variety of reasons lack of mental or physical exercise

(Start: 00:06:03)
their prey drive kicks in because they see a squirrel of a bird outdoors or they just want to go out and explore the big wide world it's your cat to sit and stay until you ask them to go out [Music] practicing indoor doorways to reinforce the behavior [Music] as your cat gets used to the leash they are going to want to go in front of you despite it might seem easier at the beginning just to follow their lead there are several reasons why you want to avoid it and the most important are about security if your cow walks in front of you it's going to decide where to go and where to stop so when your cat is leading you're going to face a lot more bush checking hole checking tree climbing and there's really nothing wrong with it but it's just going to limit you extremely when you want to go at pace the second reason if your cat is taking the lead they're going to be more alert and on their own so it's going to be a lot more difficult that they listen and respond to your commands also if your cat is in front of you

(Start: 00:07:05)
you're going to notice stretch before you do and they may just take off at speed and sleep the leash of your hand and you never saw that coming because you didn't see the threat and finally they will never learn to follow you and it's going to be difficult to let them roam free and expecting them to follow you if they're off leash my recommendation is that you always lead the way having them walking next to you or behind you [Music] choosing the wrong place to walk with your cat can really affect your cat's enjoyment and yours cats are avid hunters with a strong predatory instinct but they are also prey and their survival instincts are equally strong places which are noisy busy with dogs or other predators are places you should try to avoid as your cat is going to be mostly driven by the survival mode and they are not going to indulge in their hunting and curiosity especially when starting try to find a place which is quiet and without predators [Music] cats are not dogs they are curious and they use ambush as their preferred

(Start: 00:08:06)
hunting method so while a dog might get distracted by tracking a smell your gut hunting instincts are going to ask them to wait and pounce if they hear a bird in the distance they will also get distracted by every hole they can fit their mortar meetings in this will definitely make them stop more than you would like to using a leash which is too short it's going to make you stop every time your cat wants to stop well if you're using a longer leash your cat can stop you can keep at your own pace and they will catch up afterwards your leash should be at least 10 feet but the longer the better i will be adding the link of the list that i use in the description box below in case you're interested [Music] especially during training if you can't enforce a behavior you should not use a command if you repeat the command over and over and over it's going to lose its meaning mia come here mia come here come here you are wasting the word and you're telling your cat that they can just ignore you when training especially outdoors call your cat only when they are wearing

(Start: 00:09:08)
the leash when ignored pull from the leash and enforce the behavior when your cat is with you again you can reward as normal as if they did it on their own [Music] if you want to create positive association while you're outdoors or train your cat your regular treats won't work your cats are going to be so focused and they're hunting and surviving that they're not going to even smell the trees that you usually use at home you need a high-end treat i personally like using very thin fillets of raw turkey when outdoors use it only as a treat and don't substitute the meal with it [Music] cats are escape artists but there's one thing your cat can escape from a harness which is submitted to zero pressure your cat will only try to escape from a harness that it's spawning in the opposite direction to the ones that they want to go by pulling from the leaves you're creating an opposition reflex if your cat is at the end of the lease range especially if they're backing up you should not offer resistance

(Start: 00:10:09)
instead give your cat some additional room by walking towards them or releasing the leash if you have any left in the case that you have to prevent your cat from going the direction they want to go because there's a threat there's a dog you don't want to go there for whatever reason instead use some bursts of pressure but don't let the leash go dance for more than a fraction of a second [Music] i promised i would give you a bonus tip it feels very basic to me but it's worth remembering that we're doing this for them after your cat has maintained the proper state of mind reward them by allowing them to relieve themselves and roam around at their own well try to keep play time shorter than the time you spend focused on the walk it's also a good idea to provide a meal after the walk they have earned it it's getting darker and darker so i'm going to stop here if you found this video enriching in any way please give it a thumbs up it helps me reach more people by telling them this content might be worth watching also share with your adventure cat friends if you think it's going to bring

Title: How to INTRODUCE a NEW CAT and avoid mistakes
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-YzspHXFto

(Start: 00:00:00)
there's a misbelief that cats are not social animals but that's simply not true cats will appreciate and thrive if they can enjoy the company of another cat like the stray cats in your community too and like people some cats will become best friends and sometimes will never do but what's true it's that cats that won't be buddies at least they learn how to avoid each other and respect their boundaries cat personalities can be divided in two major generic types timid and fearful and confident than friendly cats depending on the personalities of the cats that we want to introduce dynamics may vary in order to create a good first impression and ensure a long lasting friendship we need to use a protocol that's going to work no matter the personalities of the cats that we're trying to introduce if we don't use a protocol we leave too much to luck and aggression might happen making the bonding between the two cats way more difficult or even impossible some of the non-medical causes for aggression between cats can include fear lack of socialization not enough space we're going to talk more about it later few resources like water food liter and finally an improper

(Start: 00:01:00)
introduction of a new cat in today's video i want to share with you how to identify your cat's personalities as well as providing a protocol that's going to help you in the case that you want to introduce your cat to other cats or you're bringing a newcomer home if you're a newcast mom or a nuke at that or even if you've had a cat for a while and you're looking for a fresh start consider subscribing i'm going to be uploading weekly content with tips and tricks to improve your cat life and do more with your cat [Music] appreciate my standing i would love to tell you that there's one proven way to introduce the cats give you a schedule day one do this they too do that it doesn't work like that every cat is different every interaction and every dynamic is going to defer so most of the times we're going to have to play it by year the process that will

(Start: 00:02:00)
ensure the quickest and safest cat2cat introduction goes as follows scent sharing creating a place of comfort send coexistence visual contact and finally get together each one of these steps it's going to take a different amount of time depending the couple that we're trying to introduce from several hours to days the objective is to move forward as far as there's no tension with every step we create positive reinforcement through our cat's motivators sets foot and play if fear hissing aggression show up we're going to move one step back until a more relaxed and comfortable mood is established again and here's the three if you can supervise this process closely you're going to be able to go more back and forth and accelerate the process with it every cat introduction is unique so i would recommend you to not have preset expectations but anything between 2 and 10 days is considered normal for two cats introduction despite the bond it's not going to show up after later on i've introduced mia to four friend scouts already with two of them the relationship is amazing they chase each other they play they even groom each other with one of them we're work in progress

(Start: 00:03:02)
and the last one uh it looks like it's not working so far but we're going to keep on trying before we start kissing and growling are normal behaviors in cat and they will most likely occur in katuka dynamics or intercut aggression the cat who kisses it's usually the big thing the one that's being chased or antagonized when it happens it's an indication to stop and take a step back if we don't things might escalate and set us back several steps or even forever one thing i've learned through all these introductions is that if you let two guys figure it out chances are they want [Music] let's put names to things in the case that we're introducing cats indoors we're going to have two different roles resident cat it's the cat that belongs to the territory the one that has all the soft surfaces impregnated with their smell the resident cat is characterized by being territorial protective and dominant on the other hand we have the incoming cat which is the cat that's new to the territory they have no place of comfort and everything is impregnated with another

(Start: 00:04:04)
cat's smell they are characterized by being curious unsafe uncomfortable and sometimes even overwhelmed when introducing cats outdoors the story is different both cats are going to be non-dominant and the dynamics are going to define which cat is dominant and which cat is not in today's tutorial i want to focus on cat2cat introductions happening in an indoor environment with a resin cat and an incoming cat i'm super curious what kind of cat introduction are you planning on doing and why did you decide to do it leave it in the comments i would love to know what brought you to this video introducing to cats should start before the incoming cat arrives because we're going to be using food as a positive reinforcement tool we need to be able to control when our cat is going to eat if you are free feeding your cat meaning that you always have a bowl of dried food available for them you should remove it instead we need to put our cat on a schedule eating two or three times a day i would recommend one meal at 7am one meal at 3pm and the last meal at 11

(Start: 00:05:05)
pm not pre-feeding our cat it's also a great way to get our cats sleep through the night if you're curious about it if you want to know more about it you can check out this youtube video where i explain how can you train your cat to sleep through the night by quitting free feeding we are also going to increase the value of the food and therefore the positive reinforcement is going to be stronger the second thing we want to do before the incoming cat around our place it's preparing a room for them to be in this room or area is going to become their place of comfort they're sanctuary in the case that we're introducing a recently adopted cat it's important that we visit the bed supply store before the cat arrives home the cat doesn't know us yet and they are generally overwhelmed so preventing the cat going to the pet supply with us it's going to make them a favor to set up their place of comfort or their sanctuary you're going to need five things a subsurface or blanket that they have already implemented with their own smell a litter box and some leader some self playing toys so that they can entertain themselves such as mice or balls that they can chase around and do not worry if they don't play at the beginning the surroundings are way more

(Start: 00:06:06)
interesting than the toys that they have on the floor and finally a water bowl and a football the last thing that we can do before the newcomer gets home it's scent sharing there are two good ways to do it the first one swap soft tissue toys between the cats those that can absorb smells this is going to help them link the other cat's smell with a positive experience such as playtime the second one is petting the incoming cat after having pet the resident cat and vice versa if you're liking the video and you're finding it interesting please hit the like button it really helps me reach more people by telling them that this content might be worth watching [Music] because we love our cats and we've done our homework we're going to receive the incoming cat to a home that's ready to receive them this means that there's a designated area or room that the resident cat doesn't have access anymore where the incoming cat has everything they need to be happy and at peace when we get home we're going to take the incoming cat directly to their place of comfort if possible avoiding visual contact between

(Start: 00:07:07)
the two cats you can achieve this by covering the carrier with a blanket or by placing the resin cap in a separate room while you move the incoming cat from the car to their place of comfort once the incoming cat it's in their place of comfort or their sanctuary leave the carrier in the floor open it up but do not take the cat from the carrier let the incoming cat leave the carrier at their own pace if overwhelmed just leave some food and water and leave the room the real work starts now this process can go as quickly or as slowly as you see fit we are going to consider our cats can move to the next step when they are comfortable and curious instead of being tense and agitated your cat might show some of the following behaviors when afraid or uncomfortable running away hiding aggression which includes spitting hissing growling sweating biting scratching buffing fur and tail arching their back switching them and flattening the ears if any of that happens means that you went too far too soon [Music]

(Start: 00:08:07)
keeping our cats separate while working on creating a positive association with the other catches men it's the very first step towards success tony they are putting them in separate rooms damn it we're not going to survive this one this next step is all about learning our cats to get to know each other by smelling sound before they have any visual contact this is because cats have a very strong body language and they can trigger aggression or fear in the other cats as well in this phase we're going to create a positive association with each other cat's smell every cat motivator is different but the main three are play cuddle and food being food the most common one what this means is that we're going to offer our cats opportunities to have positive experiences while smelling the other cat's smell i'm going to give you some examples for a cat that's food motivated a good opportunity to create a positive association it's feeding that cat while the other cat is present present in terms of smell remember that they are not going to see each other a good way to achieve that is having both cats sitting in opposite sides of a door this practice is great because you

(Start: 00:09:08)
can put the football closer or farther from the door to increase or diminish the amount of sand that they are perceiving so you can start a little farther away and get closer in every meal for a cat that's play motivated we're going to draw the cat's attention closer to the door where the incoming cat is and we're going to play there by creating playtime opportunities close to the door that separating both cats both cats are going to be experiencing the smell and also having that positive association with play finally a way to share smell if our cat is a snuggle or cattle motivated cuddle with our cats while we are wearing clothes that are impregnated with the other cat's smell be alert of signs of stress and agitation you can always diminish the intensity of the experience by drawing your cats further from the source of the smell [Music] allowing partial visual content it's going to feel some of their curiosity without allowing them to see full body expressions that are going to transmit body language and might trigger aggression or fear for this i like using a slightly open

(Start: 00:10:10)
door with one cat in each side there might be some hissing or growling and that's okay but be alert for signs of aggression or fear and if that happens close the door and go to the previous step where they can smell but not see each other filling our cats together might be a good way to create a bond as it is for many animals but it can also make them fearful that their food might be under threat start by putting down the resident's football first because failing to do so might put the resident cat in territorial mode also feed them at a distance when they feel comfortable and relaxed how do you know if your cat is comfortable eating well that's an easy one face down in the food versus ice up controlling the other cat intermittent eating and going away versus finishing the ball alert and scary versus being laying down or with the tail up while eating if the eating phase is successful we can start thinking about letting them interact because interacting with a full stomach usually leads to better experiences so it's a good idea to do it after a

(Start: 00:11:10)
meal with visual contact [Music] contrary to what we would imagine that would happen when we opened the door is that the incoming cat is absolutely going to ignore the resident cat instead their curiosity is going to want them to roam around and get to know the place it is common that the resident cat will follow the incoming cat while the exploration happens a small hiss or crowd or even a swap it is normal and can be accepted this is a cat way to ask for personal space if one cat attacks the other though they have to be separated immediately to be able to do that we should not let the cats roam around on their own because cats are smart and they might be able to figure it out but the outcome of them figure it out might not be the outcome that we're looking for especially if one of them feels trapped and the situation escalates ensure that the less dominant cat has always an escape route i highly encourage you to not having preset expectations because every couple of cats are going to be different

(Start: 00:12:12)
and while some cases might be very fast some might take days even weeks but be sure that cats are happier in pairs so if you can afford having a second cat in your home you're going to be rewarded with some personal space because they will play with each other instead of bothering you and twice as much cuddle time if you found this video interesting fun educative and you haven't subscribed yet consider subscribing i am going to be uploading new content on a weekly basis on how to improve your cat life and do more with your cat thank you for joining me today and happy cat introductions see you soon [Music] you

[Music] dealing with our cat poscolar biorhythm can be very annoying especially because most of us already have to deal with party to the night or get ready with my heels on neighbors if your cat attempts to wake you up after you've gone to bed they might be trying to achieve one of these three things play eat or cuddle especially kittens from under one year of age can drive us nuts from sleep deprivation in today's video i'm going to share products and practices that are going to help you sleep through the night also if you stick until the end of the video i'm going to share with you that one mistake that might keep your cat waking you up at night if you're a newcat mom or a look at that or even if you've had a cat for a while and you're looking for a fresh start consider subscribing i am uploading weekly content with tips and tricks to improve your cat life [Music]

cats must work to earn their food their behavior is going to be characterized by small periods of intense activity followed by rest because most of their prey are cropuscular or nocturnal cats have evolved to drive a donut and dusk as well which is precisely where you would like to be flattening the mattress to make matters worse our schedule reinforces their natural behavior most of our cats have little to no stimulation during the day you are at work the house is quiet and your cat has nothing to do but sleep your cat blossoms when you go home after work for your cat the day starts when you arrive from work and your home springs to life again changing our cat's behavior might be our first route of action but living with a cat will always take some compromise anyway let's see what we can do to keep our home quiet at night cats love routine set the tone for the bedroom as a no play zone keep toys outside the bedroom at all times lights out every day at the same hour once the lights are off no other interaction but cuddling can

(Start: 00:02:04)
happen turning the lights off every day at the same time should be an important part of the bedtime routine script this doesn't mean that you cannot stay later than that time what this means is that lights off at the same time and cuddling should be consistent throughout the week and you might be wondering what happens if i like to sleep in on the weekends if you do that you're going to mess up your cats to get them rhythm because for them every day is scatter day don't get me wrong sleeping in is great but sometimes we can snooze away an entire morning unless someone intervenes and cats seem to know when humans are over sleeping so if harassment won't stop maybe it's time to take the hint and wake up but i know that you're not here for me to tell you this so let's see what else we can do one of the easiest things we can do to stop our cats and turn on behavior is to stop free feeding them free feeding means that the cat will always have food available for them if you're following this practice probably you have dry food always out as i was mentioning at the beginning of the video our cat will likely rest after eating if we don't have control when our cat is eating we don't have

(Start: 00:03:05)
control either when our cat is resting so from now on instead of refilling your cat put your cat on a schedule and offer two or three meals a day i serve me at three meals a day one at seven am one at three pm and the last one at 11 pm by doing this we're going to induce sleep about the time we go to bed the more active a cat is during the day the more likely that their sleep at night and remember that play time is not only the best way to drain your cat's energy it's also the best way to bond with your cat play until your cat seems tired but don't stop just yet let your cat rest for 10-20 minutes and do it again cats are not an endurance animal they hunt through bursts try to schedule several interactive sessions throughout the day if you want to drain all your cats energy you need to do it at their rhythm if your cat sleeps through the day out of boredom because you're at work then it's natural that they're going to have energy and ready to play when you come back so if you work during the day consider investing in some toys or food puzzles or anything that's going to drain your cat's energy

(Start: 00:04:05)
while you're outside i'm going to be dropping some links in the description below with some recommendations if your gut has more energy than you consider clicker training clicker training and mental stimulation is going to drain your cat's energy way faster than any other sort of playtime if you don't know what clicker training is check out the link above a few weeks back i filmed a very comprehensive tutorial about what clicker training is and how can it help you improve the bone with your cat the last tip i'm going to give you about draining your cat's energy try to schedule the last play session of the day write the last meal that's going to resemble how they hunt so they're going to get tired then they're going to eat and then they just need to sleep [Music] if your cat is good with other cats you can also consider adding a second cat to your family if the cats are introduced properly and they are compatible they are most likely going to play with each other instead of waking you up at night however i've experienced myself two romping cats instead of one and that makes things just twice as bad a more silent alternative is to give your cat free access to

(Start: 00:05:06)
outdoors you need to know that this might pose a risk for your cat even all the outdoor threats as well as being a threat itself for the outdoor fauna cats are expert hunters and they are an invasive species so i personally do not recommend this option if routine schedule meals and play don't make the trick there are some products that might help in case you're interested i'll be adding the amazon links in the video description below night time is on time as i mentioned before it's normal for cats to hunt at night for small bikes if you can use those small bites there are some mouth-shaped feeders that you can stuff with food and hide around the house before you go to bed this is going to keep your cat busy when they wake up for munchies hopefully you and your family are going to get some uninterrupted sleep automatic cleaning systems can be programmed to deliver the first meal of the day those are awesome tools to get a couple extra hours of sleep every morning make sure you that the amount of calories intake if you add an automatic feeding system otherwise your cat might gain weight a pro tip for the automatic feeding system

(Start: 00:06:08)
set it up for your cat switching hour then instead of waking you up your cat is going to be sitting next to the machine waiting for the food delivery after the snack the cat can either go cuddle with you or take a nap somewhere else and wait for the day to get started i promise to share with you at the end of the video the one mistake that most people do when their cat disturbs them at night never ever respond to your cats seeking attention at night if your cat wakes you up at night the worst thing you can do is give them any sort of attention don't yell at them don't sweat at them and certainly do not fit them if you give a response either positive or negative you're giving your cat what they're looking for and they will just keep doing it and this is especially important if you sometimes answer and sometimes you don't because intermittent reinforcement is the strongest kind of motivation think about gambling it gets addictive because you never know what you're going to win so you keep on trying this is what you achieve when sometimes you answer your

(Start: 00:07:08)
cat and sometimes you don't also we tend to answer our cat when they get especially annoying and by doing that we're reinforcing them to be especially annoying because it's the only way you're going to listen so if you have to wake up because you yourself want to eat or you have to use the bathroom ignore your cat to summarize the bedroom is a no play zone lights on and off every day at the same time darkness means peace play with your cat several times a day and especially one time before you give them the last meal stop free feeding your cat never ever respond to your cat's demands and if nothing else works there are some products that might help consider subscribing i'm going to be uploading content on a weekly basis with tips and tricks to do more with your cat goodnight come on see you soon

(Start: 00:00:00)
right here [Music] stay [Music] down [Music] we wish it was that easy probably you're watching this video because you have an upcoming trip and you don't know what to do you're stressing out but i have good news for you if you prepare ahead of time it doesn't have to be any stressful experience probably you do not recognize this room and this is because i've been there i've done that i'm in spain i went to visit my family and i took mia with me today's guide it's going to be basically what i had to go through in order to go from new york to spain before we start though i want to make clear that cats are not social butterflies especially if they're not an outdoor cat and it might be a stressful experience for them

(Start: 00:01:00)
so if you can avoid flying altogether might be for the best but at this time flying might be your only alternative so let's go through what it takes to make this experience as smooth as possible this is the most complex video i've filmed so far in order to make it as seamless and useful as possible i'm going to organize it in chronological order starting from 3 months before traveling up to the day of the big trip if you're a newcat mom or a look at that or even if you had a cat for a while and you want to go on adventures with them consider subscribing i'm going to be uploading weekly content to help you go outdoors with your cat i never made know what it takes i'm motivated by a mix of emotion got my statement and i'm reading slow so i can understand it fully appreciate my standing so let's get this started we are three months in advance planning ahead this trip

(Start: 00:02:02)
[Music] the first thing that we want to make sure is that our cat has a microchip microchips are especially important not only for traveling but also to recover your pet in the event that it escaped and you got lost also microchips can be useful to prove ownership so if our cat escaped and got lost and someone claims that cat as theirs the microchip can help you recover your cat another thing you want to make sure is that in case that you've changed any of your contact information you contact either with the microchip provider or your veterinarian to update that information so it's the most recent possible check with your veterinarian that all your furry friends vaccinations are up to date some countries or airlines are going to require up to three months from the vaccination in order to allow you to travel others just 21 days the rabbit's vaccination is the most important one and your cat has to take it after the microchip has been installed any radius vaccination that happened before the microchip

(Start: 00:03:03)
is not going to be valid to vaccinate your cat after the microchip and this is especially important if you want to travel to europe in the case that your cat gets overwhelmed when it's outside home consider asking your veterinarian as well for relaxing medicines that are going to make it easier for your pet to be on the plane we want to do this well ahead in time so that we can try them at home in a safe environment and in the case that there's a negative reaction to the pills or that they don't work we can try new ones to travel to europe in addition to the microchip and the previous vaccination you're going to need an international health certificate signed by a usda approved veterinarian every country in the european union has different requirements so depending on the country you're visiting you will need to do some things or others i'm going to add the link below where you can check what's required to go to the country that you want to visit another thing that you want to do well ahead of time is to start carrier training your cat if we can make the carrier become a safe place where our cat can play eat sleep it's going to make it way easier for them when they're on the plane in the case that you don't know where to

(Start: 00:04:04)
start i'm going to be uploading a video soon so you can check it on the link above also in the case that you don't have a carrier yet i've shared some links with recommendations in the description below when booking your flight [Music] call me risk averse but i would not book a flight until all the points that i mentioned before are either finished or at a very good start if finding a flight it's usually complicated because we want to get the best deal at the best time from the nearest airport now it's going to get more complicated because on top of all of that we want to make sure that we can fly with our pet in cabin i would personally not fly with an airline that won't allow mia to travel in cabin some of the most bad friendly airlines are american airlines air canada air france lufthansa united just to name a few i'm sure that if you do your research you're going to find your own in the case that you're playing with an emotional support animal you're going to additionally have to check what are the specific requirements the airline might have at this point in time it might be as well interesting to

(Start: 00:05:05)
check if there's a pet friendly way to go from the arriving airport to your final destination one month in advance [Music] now we need to make sure that we have everything we need to travel with our cat it's about the maximum time it will take for anything that we buy online to reach home in time for the trip in the case that you already have these products good for you in the case that you don't you can check in the description below for the links to the products i recommend a carrier they can be as fancy as you want or as basic as you want i personally fly with a very basic carrier because i try to help me outside the carrier for as long as i can mia will only be in the carrier inside the airplane when they make me have hair there and when that happens the carrier has to be under the seat and it's the same size for all carriers in the case that your cat it's not an

(Start: 00:06:05)
outdoor cat or it's not a leash trained cat then you might want to have a carrier that can expand so that they have more room when they're not flying toilet pads they are absorbing pads that you can put at the base of the carrier in the event that our cat decides to do their thing while flying you can just wrap them and throw them away and avoid that uncomfortable smell to you or anyone sitting next to you in the airport or the airplane a leash and a harness these two are especially important when going through the security check the security officers are not going to allow you to have your cat inside the carrier going through the security check as soon as you take the cap out of the carrier with everything going around it's easy that it tries to escape and having a harness and a leash are going to prevent you chasing a cat through the airport the day of your trip so get a leash get a harness and even if your cat is not restrained at least we're going to prevent chasing a cat through an airport the day of our trip a disposable foil

(Start: 00:07:06)
tray and some litter are perfect to try to get our cat attend the nature calling before we hop on the plane baby wipes no description needed if something happens we wipe it clean and plastic bags who knows one week in advance actually 10 days in advance [Music] one thing that you surely need to travel to europe with your cat it's an international health certificate signed by a veterinarian approved by the usda this sounds like a lot but after that you need to get afis to sign that form this sounds very complicated but there are plenty of usda veterinarians out there just google near me usda approved veterinarian and probably they're going to be able to help you with those forms in the video description below i'm going to be adding the link to the usda website and there you're going to see what are the requirements for the specific country you want to visit remember that the international health certificate is only going to be valid for 10 days after the veterinarian signs it this

(Start: 00:08:07)
means that you have to schedule your veterinarian visit within those 10 days and after that you need to get it signed by office my recommendation is that you find a veterinarian that can help you with both the usda approved international health certificate as well as getting the paperwork done with atheists also 10 days in advance it's a good milestone to start doing short trips with your cat inside the carrier that's going to get them used to it and it's not going to be the big trip the first time that they are inside the carrier the night before you leave [Music] get everything ready write it down you don't want to forget any of these the day before the trip a carrier harness leash toilet training patch a disposable full tray a bag with litter vaccination international health certificate and a water bowl and a football in the case that you're flying early in the morning try to feed a big meal the night before the flight but don't fit anything in the morning as a general rule we don't want our cats to have eaten anything

(Start: 00:09:08)
six to nine hours prior to the flight this is going to minimize two things the use of the litter box and the chances of picking because they're still doing the digestion have some food ready for the day though so as soon as you are at the arrival airport you can find a quiet place and feed your cat if it's a long trip they will really appreciate it also consider taking some treats with you i personally like creating this positive association between the carrier and the airplane every time i travel the big day the travel day [Music] if your cat is a cat that freaks out and hides consider confining your cat in a room the day before the trip cats are smart animals and they know when something's off confining your cat in a room it's going to prevent you from searching for your cat in this stressful moment where the luggage is out and the uber is waiting for you before the big trip this is probably the most valuable piece of advice and it's so obvious but go early to the airport so marinelands can be especially slow and managing pets

(Start: 00:10:15)
and you can face additional complications try to go at least one hour before the time that you would regularly go also consider that when with your cat you're not going to be as agile as you usually are at the airport when you go through the security check they're going to ask you to take the cat outside the carrier there is where the harness and the leash come very handy once the cat is outside the carrier and with you they are going to ask you to walk through the metal detector some airports offer private screening rooms that's another alternative to take the cat outside the carrier in an environment where escaping is far more unlikely once you are passed the security check it's a good moment to buy water you might not need it but your cat should have water available at all times and this is something that people always ask me when i'm traveling with my cat or does your cat poop or pee in the case that they need it well once you've come through the security check it's a good moment to take that disposable foil tray that litter bag and go to the restroom in a quiet place and try to get your cat do their thing it gives me a massive peace of mind to

(Start: 00:11:15)
get me a tendonator call at the airport prior to warning it's the only way i know that she's not going to do it in the plane while flying during the flight [Music] takeoff and landing are the two moments where the plane gets more noisy and shaky so it's most likely that your cat is going to freak out in those moments but i freak out in those moments as well so i guess that's normal some cats might get very vocal when in the carrier especially during takeoff and landing placing a hand next to the carrier or even sticking a hand inside the carrier might give them comfort and keep them quiet some companies really acknowledge how hard can it be to fly with a cat and if they see that there are empty rows somewhere in the plane they might just take you and your fury friend and place you in one of those rows so that you have the whole place for you this can be especially useful not only for you but also for the rest of the plane because if you can have your carrier next to you

(Start: 00:12:16)
it's way easier to come for your cat and keep them chilled and quiet it's been a very long video so if you made it through here thank you if you found this video useful in any way if you found it informative if you learned something please give it a thumbs up it helps me reach more cat owners that want to do more with their cats by telling them that this content might be worth watching said this thank you so much see you next [Music] time [Music] you

Title: BENGAL CAT myths VS facts - After having a Bengal Kitten for 4 months
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1JPP2BFWPs

(Start: 00:00:00)
the first time you see a bengal cat roaming around someone's house you're like am i at the zoo that's because this spectacular cat breed sports a spotted or marbled coat which is unique very close to a white leopard the bengal cuts stunning wide looks are drawing a lot of attention to the breathing with it breeders that are trying to benefit from it i don't regret for a second haven't chosen me as my adventure companion but because i've been spending some time with her i'm convinced that bengal cats are not for everyone let's talk about some myths and truths about bengal cats [Music] if you're watching this video it's probably not the first time that you're seeking information about bengal cats and if it is welcome i really wish that

(Start: 00:01:00)
at least you have as much fun as i'm having with the journey i got distracted let's get back to it well so if this is not the first piece of content that you've consumed about bengal cats probably you have already read or heard that bengal cats like water that are hypoallergenic that are extremely loyal extremely smart and yes most of that is true but there are some nuances i would love to share with you my experience after sharing the first seven months with me what i'm going to share with you are not absolute truths it's a sample of one based on my own opinion bengal cats are hypoallergenic despite not sneezing like a maniac when in mia's company i still had allergies when i first got her to the point that i even contacted a couple friends saying hey i won't be able to keep her after four months my allergies have almost disappeared but at the beginning i had asthma like chest compression every now and then i still have to take pills but it's worth doing when you have cat allergies what you're reacting to it's a tiny

(Start: 00:02:01)
lightweight protein called feld1 this protein is mostly found in cats standard urine and saliva when cats groom themselves they're four sheds and with it the allergy causing protein bengals four is short and pelt like because bengal's coat is so low maintenance they spend very little time grooming themselves long story short bengal cats might be apologetic but they're definitely not allergy free if you have cat allergies i really recommend you to do two things before committing to the ownership of a cat the first one visit the doctor and see how bad your allergies are the second one try to spend some time with that cat itself if that cat still doesn't exist because it hasn't borne maybe you can do it with their parents good care no scratches or anything that's so good bengal cats are fond of water i've heard so many times that bengal cats like water well mia doesn't it might change with

(Start: 00:03:01)
them but at seven months old and despite she's attracted to the water noise she will not touch the quarter with anything but hairful what is true though is that mia loves drinking straight from the top and i've heard that some bengals are even not drinking if it's not running water so my point is it's true that many bengal cats like water but don't assume that because bengal cats can like water your cat is going to like it for sure and i do know some bengal cats that like water so if you get a bengal cat don't be surprised if one of a sudden it appears in the shower or it jumps in the pool while you're swimming in it bengal cats are smart from what i've seen with mia bengal cats enjoy as much mental stimulation as they enjoy physical they are an extremely smart breed and that makes them very capable of learning tricks and verbal commands with only seven months mia already knows like six or seven tricks and she's very fast at learning new ones if you want to check them out you can click on the video

(Start: 00:04:02)
i don't know what it is you can click on the video and check it out there's a short video two minutes where i showcase every treat that me has learned so far [Music] teaching your bengal cat tricks it's not only fun and a great way to amuse your guests it's also a very nice way to improve the communication with your cat as well as strengthen your bond you want to see more click here and see the full show bengal cats are destructive bengal cats are high energy and they are very demanding when it comes to physical stimulation their energy accumulates and if you don't help them release it yes they can be destructive bengal cats are very loyal bengal cats are desired in part for their personality bengal cats are also very desired for their personality which makes them very friendly to humans as well as other pets

(Start: 00:05:04)
in the household in particular bengal cats are famed for being very loyal to one specific person in the family and becoming very attached to them now that doesn't mean that they're not going to be friendly with anyone else in the household however there's a high chance that your bengal cat is going to become particularly committed to one person in the household in my case i live alone and i don't have the experience of me sharing a household with other people but i can say that one mia is extremely loyal and she follows me around the house too she's also great with people that come visit if you want your bengal cat to be social i highly recommend you that you socialize your cat very early on if you expose your cat to people from very early on your cat is going to get used to people and your cat is going to be fine with people around some cat owners be like oh my god hates people come on you had your cat closed in a household for five years without meeting anyone absolutely it's going to be terrified as soon as someone enters into their territory but if you've been exposing your cat your cat has high probabilities of liking other people okay said this bengal cats yes they are loyal but i would say that they are

(Start: 00:06:05)
beyond loyal they are attention seekers and if you're ignoring your cat or you're not paying attention to your cat you might just find your cat hanging off your back just to let you know that they exist that they are present bengal cats are good with other pets again bengal cats tend to be good with people and other animals but you need to train them and you need to do it properly from my own experience i could personally introduce me and to other pets and many of my friends and i've never had a problem i'm lying one time but the other cat was an  the way you introduced to cats can have a long-term effect in the relationship that those two cats are going to have in the future so take it gradually and do it properly to increase the chances of long-lasting friendship or at least that they tolerate each other if you want to know more about how to introduce your cat to other pets consider watching this video to summarize don't get a bengal cat if what you're looking for it's a sweet gentle lap cat a living sculpture that requires little interaction but if you go for a bengal know that they make great loving companions that can be a little demanding at times they are healthy

(Start: 00:07:05)
robust and respond to play quality food and interaction they are smart and they will let you know it and yes they are unique and beautiful i really hope you liked the video if you liked it in any way if it was informative entertaining give it a thumbs up it helps other viewers know that it's worth watching and it helps me get to more people thanks for watching see you out there [Music]

Title: How to TEACH YOUR CAT THEIR NAME and to COME WHEN CALLED
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdjEKMsKZ-M

(Start: 00:00:00)
with positive reinforcement you won't only teach your cat their name you can as well teach them to come on command mia come here what are you doing teaching our cat to come when cold it's very cute indoors but it becomes extremely important when we are on an adventure both for leash walking as well as in the event that they escaped if you're a newcast mom or a new cadet or even if you had a cat for a while and you want to take them on adventures with you consider subscribing i'm going to be uploading tips and tricks to help you go outdoors with your [Music] cat by a mix of emotion got my statement and i'm reading slow so i can understand it fully appreciate my standing i'm going to go with the bold assumption

(Start: 00:01:00)
that you have a furry companion that probably it's a cat i'm also going to assume that you give your cat treats what happens when you get the bag of treats what does the cat do does it stay what it is does it keep on sleeping the sound of the back of treats has become an unconditioned stimulus which means that without us teaching our cats anything our cats are already reacting to it they understand that that sound comes with treats our cat has created already the positive association between the sound of the bag and receiving treats and therefore they react to it our cats have fallen victims of classic conditioning the fact that our cats react to the sound of the duck it's the irrefutable reality that cats can be trained so what we're going to do is leverage this association to get them calm when called today's tutorial it's going to be divided in three parts the first one we're going to teach our cut their name the second one we're going to teach them how to come on command the third one i want to share with you some tips and

(Start: 00:02:00)
tricks that are going to make this training a lot easier you know that i like to give you homework so for today we're going to need treats we're going to need a clicker and most importantly we're going to need to make sure that our clicker is charged if you're wondering why your clicker doesn't have any batteries or where the usb port is to charge your clicker please pause the video for 5 minutes and watch this one instead i've created a tutorial where i explain what clicker training is and it's going to be very useful for you to watch that one first once you're done i'll be waiting for you here let's assume we all have treats we all have a clicker and that the clickers are charged let's go find a place where we can get our cats moving up and down we're going to start by saying their name and clicking right after then we're going to reward to start this exercise we're going to draw their attention with the treats nia [Music]

(Start: 00:03:03)
mia [Music] at some point our cat is going to understand that whenever we say their name there's a trick coming when that happens they're going to start looking at us after we say their names at this point it's when we can move to the next stage of the training now instead of just giving them their treat we're going to throw it away when they finish eating we're going to say their name shake the treats and when they are within our arms reach we're going to click then throw it again [Music] after a few repetitions they're going to create the positive association between their name and treats and thus every time that we say their name they're going to come mia [Music] when this happens we can move to the

(Start: 00:04:04)
next step you can start playing around the house say their name and see what happens meow [Music] teaching your cat to come when cold it's a pretty straightforward trick but we can face head ones i'm going to share with you some extra tips that are going to drastically increase your probabilities of success let's assume that your cat is food motivated it's not always the case but that's a topic for another video not all trades are created equal find that one treat that's going to make your cat go crazy for save the treat only for training sessions pre-feeding your cat which means having always a bowl of food ready for them on the floor it's very likely going to decrease their

(Start: 00:05:05)
motivation for treats instead put your cat on a schedule make sure that they eat only two or three times a day wait for your cat to finish eating before calling their name again at some point they might even look at you waiting for the command from now on every time that you put the bowl of food down call their name even if they are already present yeah the clicker allows us to mark behaviors with quite a lot of precision try to mark the behavior always at the same distance i personally consider she came on command when she's within my arm's reach good girl then wait a second click here in the link or here i freaking never guess there's a link somewhere please click on the link

Title: How to TRAIN A CAT TO SIT ON YOUR SHOULDER using clicker training
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5GSrT-bEGk

(Start: 00:00:00)
walking around with a cat sitting on your shoulder how cool is that well some cats will do it on their own and you don't need to teach them absolutely anything most won't but it can be trained my objective today is to teach you how to train your cat to sit on your shoulder and as a skill it's extremely useful whenever we want to go outdoors with them having our cats on our shoulder is going to enable us to walk farther for longer if you're a new cat mom or a new cat dad or even if you had a cat for a while and you want to go on adventures with your cat consider subscribing in the channel i'm going to be uploading videos on a weekly basis with tips and tricks to help you go outdoors with your cat i'm already she's mia but i know what it takes [Music]

(Start: 00:01:03)
i know that you came here to teach your cat to jump from the floor to your shoulder but that takes a while so bear with me the first half of the video is going to be geared towards getting our cats comfortable on our shoulders and being able to walk distances with them and in the second part of today's tutorial i'm going to share the progression to get our cat jumping from the floor to our shoulder before we start i need you to do some homework we're going to require two pre-steps before going into this tutorial the first one our clicker needs to be charged the second one we need to be familiar with finger targeting and our cat has to be able to follow our fingers with comfort in the case that you don't know what clicker training is stop check out this video and once you've seen it come back here it's going to make your life easier and you're going to understand what are we doing here if you know what clicker training is but you don't know what finger targeting is there's also the link you can check that out i'm going to be adding the two links in the description below so if you want to check them afterwards you can also do that let's assume that we all have our clickers charged we all know what clicker training is we all know what finger targeting is and

(Start: 00:02:04)
our cats understand both clicker training and finger targeting i've created also a checklist of things that we're going to need for this training treats a clicker a sofa and a hoodie or a thick jacket bear in mind that having our cats on our shoulders might scratch us i'm not responsible for any scratches that you're going to receive during this training we've got everything ready let's get into it the first thing that we want to do is to create a positive association with our shoulders to do that we're going to turn our shoulders into a safe comfy place that provides food obviously we're going to place our cat on top of the back of the sofa we're going to sit in front of them and we're going to place the football more or less at the shoulder height our cat is going to try to reach the foot by putting both paws on our shoulder when that happens mark that behavior with a clicker once you've marked the behavior you can proceed to feed your cat

(Start: 00:03:07)
you will want to repeat this procedure at least for a week my recommendation is that you do at least one meal a day from your shoulder once you feel your cat is comfortable eating from your shoulder try this lean forward and you're going to see how your cat puts more weight on your shoulder at some point they might eventually jump on your shoulder and stay there that's what we're trying to achieve in this second step if you're finding this content useful please give it a thumbs up and share it with your cat friends reaching more people really helps me on my mission to normalizing that cats can go outdoors as well small tip there's only one thing that can hold you back is if your cat is not comfortable on your shoulder on a thick sweater your cat is going to be able to have more grip the second thing to improve the grip is don't trim their nails at least for a week or two make sure that they are sharp this is getting interesting isn't it once your cat is comfortable sitting on your shoulder you can start considering getting them to jump on your shoulder on their own it's a slow process and it's going to require them to be very comfortable on

(Start: 00:04:08)
your shoulder before they feel like jumping on their own so take it easy i consider me a very fast learner and it took us two weeks training every day to get our cats to it on their own we're going to start from the sofa again and finger targeting instead of the food we're going to reward them as soon as they touch with their nose or finger for the next step we're going to repeat the same process but sitting on our bed our cats are going to have to jump from the bed to our shoulder now we're going to get high find the chair and do the same standing up it's a slow process so if one step is not working out just go one step back and build confidence there before you move to the next step in our case the chair step was the most difficult if you're getting stuck in this step you can divide it into the first one get them jump on your knee the second one get them jump from your knee to your shoulder always using finger targeting you almost have it let's do it from the floor get low and provide the knee as a step good girl again this is a two-week

(Start: 00:05:09)
process so take it easy try to do short sessions three four five minutes and do it every day even more than once a day this is all for today i really hope you liked it i really expect to see many people having their cats on their shoulders around the city and around the mountains so try it out let me know how it goes on the comments and again if you liked it give it a thumbs up have a good one see you next time repeat this procedure repeat this proceed procedure so repeat this procedure procedure procedure pro so repeat this procedure procedure i will try not to rush it so repeat this procedure several times during a week

Title: TRAIN YOUR CAT TO WALK ON A LEASH Using Positive Reinforcement - TUTORIAL
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etaaYEuMhx8

(Start: 00:00:00)
let's talk list training your cat can and will walk on a leash but not all cats are created equal and it will require your patience and not to force them before we start be mindful that going outdoors might be overwhelming for your cat probably it will be and there's a fine line between challenge and fear and we don't want to cross that line if we cross that line it's going to become way more difficult to overcome that threshold which is the front door in this video today i'm going to share harness acclimation harness training leash training and finally the great outdoors

(Start: 00:01:01)
[Music] hey buddy there's an infinity of harnesses out there how do we know which one is the one that we need for our pet you need to know what do you want the harness for where do you want to go with your cat because depending on your objective you're going to choose one hardness or another cats are not dogs and there's plenty of dog harnesses out there that say that are suitable for cats but that's not really true the body type of a dog it's nowhere close where the body type of a cat is so you want to make sure that you're getting a cat specific harness because we don't want our cap to escape right that's the whole reason why we're walking them on a leash at the end of the video i'm going to share the three harnesses that i use for photography for places where i want to make sure that mia cannot escape and the other one is a harness that's as well cooked for those days it's extremely

(Start: 00:02:01)
cold neck and grit are the two measurements that you need to check before buying the harness for your bed our cats are pro acrobats and we want to make sure that we're not restricting their movement my ultimate recommendation but we're in coffee times and we don't all have the chance or the willingness to go to a pet store try them on your path between the harness and their body we can fit one or two fingers the first thing we want to do is to introduce the harness and our cat mia this is the harness harness this is mia jokes aside how do we introduce a harness into a household where we put the harness in their comfort place i would be placing the harness on her cat tree for at least a week or a week and a half the objectives of doing this are basically two they can impregnate with their sand the harness and they can feel it their own and the second one is that we can start building this positive association and if we see that our pet is sniffing or touching the harness in any way we can use clicker training

(Start: 00:03:03)
click and reward and we start building that positive reinforcement or positive association if you don't know what clicker training is you can click on the video if it's not here it's here i don't really know how this works but you can click on the video somewhere here and see what clicker training is i'm so excited we're putting it on she's looking at me like what the what are you doing ah this is a lot of talking okay i'm so excited we're putting the harness if your cat is comfortable with you blocking their movement easily place a hand on their chest to prevent them moving forward buckle up a different method is to use some food to distract them and place the hardness while they are eating the case that none of these two techniques work for you leave it on the comments and we can try to figure out together a way to put the harness on your cat two things can happen now it can happen

(Start: 00:04:03)
that your cat starts squiggling around and it's not comfortable and just lays on the floor complaining not willing to move or they just don't care and they keep doing life as normal if your cat is the second type you're sad in the case that your cat doesn't like the harness we have work to do and it's going to require patience the first thing that i want you to try is to get their favorite toy and move it around them see if it sparks their attention even if they start moving keep playing with them and you might just have solved the problem if that's the case keep it moving keep them entertained keep them following that toy and you're set the case that the toy doesn't work we're going to do three things keep the sessions very short praise them a lot and give them a lot of treats for how long my recommendation is that you do sessions of no more than one two three minutes two three times a day for a week it should be enough i just sounded like

(Start: 00:05:05)
a doctor this step is so simple it shouldn't be considered a step once our cat is comfortable with the harness we just incorporate the leash and we start walking them around home [Music] the great outdoors are overwhelming our cats are predators but they are also pretty and they can get overwhelmed by cars by dogs white people wind by who knows what they hear a lot better than us they see a lot better than and we have no idea what's going on but they do what can we do about it we want to keep the sessions short and sweet make every experience with the leash and the harness positive so that they want to repeat it in the future if they feel scared shaky you're expecting too much too soon two pieces of advice here the first one is choose wisely the places that you go with your cat a quiet place it's going to make the experience more pleasant for everyone and the second one our pets are more active at dawn and dusk those time frames are going also to make our pet be

more comfortable there's no such thing as walking again cats walk us they get distracted a lot they want to smell absolutely everything they want to check every single hole they want to climb every single tree so take a lot of patience and a lot of treats this is the most important piece of advice i will give you today if the cat starts walking backwards don't pull from the leash if the line goes stance that could cause them to escape instead walk towards them so that they can not squeeze themselves out of the harness it doesn't matter what harness it is even the escape roof harnesses if they are walking backwards and the leashes stands they can escape that's terrifying it's the harnesses i said that i would share with you which are my top favorite three harnesses that i own and this is what i'm going to do now i said harnesses not lesion color most cat colors are breakaway so that they don't get this strangled if they get entangled into something what protects our cat from the environment if they

break away so don't use a collar and a leash to walk them outdoors use a leash and a harness long story short invest on a hardness which one well i'm going to show you another ones that i use these are the three harnesses that i use the most this one super light it gives her a lot of mobility she can jump around and do everything that she usually does and it's great for taking pictures this one very sturdy very well built it's very warm but she cannot really do anything with it basically for walking up and down and this is the safest harness that i've ever had she has never escaped from it and she has escaped from others it's the one that i used to walk her in the city and to ride here on my bike these are my three favorite [Music]

points that i'm missing it's because i didn't choose a place where she could be comfortable so for the next time i think that i have to do a little bit more research in terms of where do i take her because the way there was awesome i didn't think about the dogs so i need to be mindful of that for the future if you want to see more adventures subscribe in the channel i'm going to be uploading every adventure i go on whenever it's possible if you want to learn how to teach your cat to ride on your bike with you i'm going to be uploading a video soon you can find the link here in the case it's not there subscribe you're going to receive a notification it's going to be here soon until then happy adventures and remember your cat can do it as well bye

(Start: 00:00:00)
hey y'all welcome to the second video of my channel today i want to share with you that one trick that changed everything for me and i that one trick that enabled everything else whenever people see me doing things with me they always come up with questions like oh how did you get mia to hop on your shoulder like that how did you get me used to riding in the bike with you oh is that a cat how is that you're hiking with a cat how how did you train that cat to walk on a niche hey look who came so basically what i'm trying to do with my channel it's normalized the fact that cats can go out with us they can go outdoors they can go on a kayak they can go hiking just because cats are not dogs and they behave different than dogs and they think different than dogs people tend to assume that cats cannot go outdoors but that's not true and this is what i'm trying to normalize in this channel i never

(Start: 00:01:00)
[Music] appreciate so what you're trying to achieve is to do more with your cat and go outdoors and do all this fun stuff in this channel you're going to find both the adventures that me and i go on as well as what tricks what trainings what stuff did we do to be able to get there so hopefully after the trick that i'm going to tell you today you're going to be able to go on adventures very soon and i'm looking forward to know how that goes so if you finally try it and go outdoors and have fun or not just leave it in the comments i would like to know more about it okay before we start we need to make sure that we have the basics right and we're going to be using clicker training a lot so let me go very quickly and remind

(Start: 00:02:00)
everyone what clicker training is clicker training is nothing more than positive reinforcement in combination with a clicker and a clicker it's nothing more than a noise maker in case you don't know what a clicker is a clicker looks like this they're very cheap you can find them on amazon you can find them in any pet store and they are the basics for classic conditioning training okay but why the clicker why is the clicker import why don't i say like good girl or goodbye well the clicker is a tool that's going to allow us to mark that exact moment when our pet is doing that behavior that we want to reward for instance imagine that wait imagine we are in youtube i can just show you up good girl okay so you've seen it if i say good girl there are 20 000 things that our animal is doing or it's thinking about during that time there is no way that our pet or our our first friend is going to know that

(Start: 00:03:01)
when they are standing in two legs what we are rewarding is the fact that they are not touching with the front pole in the surface anymore they might think it's because they're looking us in the eyes they might think it's because they just sniffed something um they grabbed their fingers so how do we let them know what specific behavior is the one that we want by clicking instantly in in that moment where they do what we want them to do she's sleeping right now so i'm not gonna make the noise but it does like click click click click whatever if you've never heard about clicker training before i highly encourage you to go and check out this video it's in my channel and in that video you're going to find three very easy steps that will get you started with clicker training for today let's assume we all know what clicker training is our clickers are charged our pets understand what are we doing here every time we produce a noise and let's get into it that

(Start: 00:04:02)
was a long intro i think i still haven't shared with you what's that one trick that you should teach first yes yes i'm saying it i'm saying it yeah no okay i'm stupid i don't know how to be in front of a camera that number one trick is finger targeting what's finger targeting finger targeting it's turning our fingers into a target what we're going to try to achieve is to get our bed touch with their nose our finger this is going to help us guide them [Music] make them hop into things put them on the carrier put them on our bike make them come cuddle with us get out of the counter off the bed and in order to help my mind and you that this video it's not super messy i'm going to try to separate this video into big pieces the

(Start: 00:05:03)
first one is going to be mainly focused in the three steps that we need to follow in order to teach finger targeting and the second one is going to be a few tricks that made my life a lot easier when teaching clicker training let's get started we need treats we're going to take the treat between our fingers middle finger thumb finger to make a gesture our pets are going to end up identifying this gesture as come closer touch with your nose my finger how do we get there so because we're placing the treat in between the middle finger and the thumb and there's the other finger in between our animals our furry friends are going to just go straight and touch with their nose this finger while they're trying to sniff what we have in the other two in the same exact moment where our pets touch the index finger with their noses we're going to clip we will have to repeat this about 20 30 times so be patient just repeat it over and over again

(Start: 00:06:09)
our first friend already knows that as soon as our finger starts moving they head there they know that finger moving means click and click means food we can proceed to remove that foot from the finger but we're going to just keep doing the same if your forefront is still not reacting means that you haven't done that first step enough so my recommendation is just keep doing it until they identify moving finger let me head there let me touch it with my nose because i know that it's going to come a reward afterwards if our furry friends are already understanding that let's move to the second step we remove the treat and we keep on playing just up and down keep it simple short distances just keep them encouraged one treat at a time the third step is the fun one when you start being creative [Music] you get that same movement that you try

(Start: 00:07:10)
to get them jump into stuff hide into things do longer distances don't reward them immediately let them chase your finger [Music] and let them get used to these i'm going to chase your finger because i understand that's what you want from me and by doing that you have achieved the way to get your pet go where you want them to be if you're finding value in this video make sure to subscribe i'm going to be uploading new videos every week with tips and tricks to help you get outdoors with your cats because yes cats can do that as well my bonus tips at the very end of the video are these three donuts treats your scribble in the case that you want to use treats because your cat reacts better to them make sure you cut them into smaller pieces buy a candy box buy something smaller that makes it easy for you to docify the treats and the third one is make sure that you don't

Title: Clicker Training FOR CATS Tutorial - How to CLICKER TRAIN CAT in 3 steps
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTAcXiYothM

(Start: 00:00:00)
good girl do you know how long it took me 
to teach me a clicker training   one week clicker training is super simple 
and you can teach your cat almost anything   with classic conditioning or clicker training or 
mark and reward what's exactly clicker training   clicker training basically focus on the behaviors 
that you want to see more on your cat ow cats are going to repeat behaviors that give 
them what they want aka treats so you might be   wondering where does the clicker come to play the 
clicker or marker it's going to indicate your cat   the exact moment where he or she is doing 
what you want them to do mia come here good girl clicker training it's fairly 
simple you're going to be able to teach   your cat almost anything with this system okay 
let's get into it three steps to clicker train  

(Start: 00:01:03)
your cat step number one don't pre-feed 
your cat step number two charge the clicker   step number three start marking those behaviors 
that you want to see more often on your cat   and that's it step number one don't repeat 
your cat having free access to food it's   going to make your cat less eager to perform the 
behaviors that you want them to repeat because   at the end the way that you have to pay them 
is with treats so put your cat on a schedule   i feed me three times a day but there's plenty of 
people that do it twice and that works perfectly   fine as well for instance mia she's a kitty and i 
know that when meal time is close she's not really   going to listen she's so eager to eat that she's 
going to be focused on the treats that i have on   my hand or my pocket instead of focusing on what 
i'm asking her to do i won't be able to train her   after i fed her i won't be able to train her 
either if she is super hungry get to know your   cat see what moment is best but rule number 
one don't repeat your cat step number two

(Start: 00:02:09)
charging the clicker this is the most important 
step if your cat doesn't understand that the   noise produced by this device it's going to give 
them food they're never going to understand that   you're trying to reinforce the behavior afterwards 
do not make the sound if you're not going to treat   your cat you want to make sure that whenever this 
device makes a sound your cat knows that something   good happened otherwise you're going to mess the 
whole thing what you're going to do to charge the   clicker is produce the sound and immediately 
after give the reward give a treat because i   drink with me quite a lot i do not use streets 
if i use streets i make sure that i divide them   in three or four pieces instead of giving a full 
treat because otherwise she would be full and stop   listening to me in two minutes so instead of using 
treats i use scribble it's going to take a while   for your cat to understand that after this sound 
comes a reward so you want to do this for a while

(Start: 00:03:11)
three four times a day sessions of five minutes 
during a week consistency is key step number three marking those behaviors that we want them to 
repeat the sound produced by this device it's   pretty unique so it's going to be easier to make 
sure that the cat links this sound and this sound   only with the behavior that we want them to repeat 
you can use any sound producing device that's   going to have a sound that's different enough 
that your cat is not going to expect to treat   for no reason but my recommendation go to amazon 
buy these ones i think this one cost three dollars   no big deal so you want to produce the sound the 
exact moment your cat does the behavior that you   want to see more often scratching your cat tree 
instead of scratching your sofa okay so let's   wrap this up step number one don't free feed your 
cat step number two charge the clicker and step   number three start marking the exact moment where 
your cat does those behaviors that you want to   see more often the first trick that i taught mia 
was finger targeting finger targeting means that   when i produce this movement she's going to 
try to touch my finger with her nose this is  

(Start: 00:04:13)
super useful because i can ask her to go 
somewhere just by pointing with my finger that was the first trick and after that 
came many other get her into the carry get her on my shoulder if you want to learn how to 
finger target click in the link   if you want to learn how to do any 
specific trick write it on the comments   and if you like the video you know
